2547, "Great Powers"

2548, "The Miranda Accord of 2436 was signed into effect amongst the ashes of the Great War. The war was remarkable in the excesses of the tactics and weapons used, harkening back to the unrestrained industrial warfare of centuries ago. Unrestricted nuclear orbital bombardment had left several planets ecologically devastated, including Earth. By the time of ceasefire, billions of souls had perished. Humanity would not survive another such war.

A conference attended by representatives of every sovereign star nation set into motion a solemn, binding vow - never again will such destruction visit humanity's homes among the stars.

In addition to finalising the terms of armistice, a major tenet of the treaty was drafted to prevent a repeat of this tragedy by restricting the storage and deployment of spaceborne nuclear weapons to capital ships. Further treaty restrictions to nuclear proliferation limited capital ships to the three recognised Great Powers: the Atlantean Federation, Sinarus Combine and Alban Commonwealth. If any nation violated these restrictions, an automatic declaration of war by the three Great Powers would be enacted to enforce the treaty.

The galactic balance of power to enforce this treaty has been upended by the explosive expansion of the Atlantean Federation Navy, which in numbers and tonnage is double the combined strength of the Commonwealth and Combine navies. Dissenting voices questioning the relevance of the Miranda Accord have been increasing in volume, with many political commentators suggesting the need of a new Accord to limit naval construction."

2549, "     Atlantean Federation"

2550, "'Peace Through Strength'

The Atlantean Federation is the largest and most politically dominant of the Terran powers. Founded on liberal democratic values and forged in the aftermath of the Great War, the Federation sees itself as the vanguard of civilization - a stabilising force in an otherwise volatile galaxy. Its federal government, elected by a wide-ranging electorate, functions in concert with a powerful defense establishment and a sprawling network of corporate stakeholders. The Federation's institutions are robust, its cultural exports omnipresent, and its fleet unmatched in size.

The Federation operates not only as a military bloc but also as a cultural and economic juggernaut. Member systems enjoy internal autonomy, but defense, foreign affairs, and trade are centralized under a strong executive. Federation citizens are raised in a civic culture that combines frontier optimism with post-industrial privilege. Critics argue this fosters complacency and hubris; supporters claim it's the reason the Federation endures.

Its foreign policy is one of preemptive engagement and soft power projection. Officially, it promotes stability, free markets, and democratic values. In practice, it often intervenes to secure trade corridors, install 'friendly' regimes, or counter threats from autocratic rivals. Peacekeeping deployments and military aid are routine, as are covert operations in systems deemed strategically fragile. Its navy is an enormous, carrier-led force designed for rapid response and long-range power projection.

Beneath the noble rhetoric lies a hard truth: the Federation doesn't just lead the galactic order - it defines it. Whether viewed as a benevolent hegemon or a veiled empire, the Federation's influence is everywhere, and its reach seldom questioned."

2551, "     Sinarus Combine"

2552, "'One People. One Future.'

The Sinarus Combine is a technocratic autocracy built on the ruins of the old Sol Combine, forged in the fire of collapse and civil war. Where the Federation champions liberty and identity, the Combine champions discipline, sacrifice, and the rule of systems. It presents itself as a society free from the chaos of populism, where the state ensures prosperity through centralized planning, social engineering, and unflinching authority. To Combine leadership, authoritarianism is not an evil - it's the only thing that works.

The Combine is governed by a collection of Directorates and Ministries under the oversight of the Archon, with all activity aligned toward a central Strategic Doctrine. Citizens are assigned roles based on aptitude metrics and are subject to rigorous social credit systems that measure productivity, loyalty, and 'civic resilience.' Surveillance is ubiquitous but precise. Rather than brute repression, the Combine relies on predictive analytics and social conditioning to maintain internal cohesion.

Externally, the Combine projects strength through a doctrine of calculated deterrence. Its navy is mobile, hard-hitting, and optimized for pre-emptive strikes - especially in disputed border zones. The Combine seeks to reclaim territories it considers historically or strategically vital, and is unafraid to use economic blackmail or covert destabilization to achieve its aims. Unlike the Federation, it does not dress its actions in moral language. Efficiency is justification enough.

Critics describe the Combine as dystopian; its citizens, when asked, call it safe. To live in the Combine is to live under scrutiny, but with guarantees: shelter, education, order. The state may be intrusive, but it never forgets you exist."

2553, "     Alban Commonwealth"

2554, "'For Crown and Country.'

The Alban Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy that blends ceremonial tradition with hard-edged strategic clarity. Though smaller in territory and military strength than its rival Great Powers, it plays an outsized role in interstellar politics through cultural prestige, naval quality, and diplomatic finesse. Ruled by King Edward Wynson, a widely respected sovereign believed by many to possess a gift for political foresight, the Commonwealth positions itself as a principled middle path between autocracy and populism.

The Commonwealth's internal structure is federal but loyal to the Crown. Member worlds are granted local autonomy within a shared legal and military framework, anchored by a deeply ingrained sense of civic honour. The upper echelons of society include hereditary nobles, knighted professionals, and elected representatives, all bound by a shared ethic of service. In the Commonwealth, one's title is earned by action more than birth.

The Alban Crown Navy is renowned for its professionalism, discipline, and operational efficiency. It favours cruiser-led task groups and long-range strike platforms, prioritising quality over volume. Though often outnumbered, Commonwealth fleets routinely outperform expectations, especially in coalition environments. Commonwealth officers are in high demand as trainers, advisers, and diplomats.

On the galactic stage, the Commonwealth is a quiet kingmaker. It builds coalitions, brokers treaties, and offers sanctuary to reformers and dissidents from more extreme regimes. While not as aggressive as the Federation or as controlling as the Combine, it is no less ambitious. Its diplomacy is deliberate, its neutrality strategic, and its restraint a form of power in its own right."

2555, "Other Powers"

2556, "The central powers of the Combine and Federation dominate the heavily populated first colonies of humankind. Out in the anti-Spinward peripheries of the Orion arm, however, smaller powers jostle amongst each other for advantage."

2557, "     Republique Jacobine"

2558, "'Through Reason, Liberty. Through Sacrifice, Justice.'

The Republique Jacobine is an authoritarian parliamentary republic forged in revolution and sustained by national myth. To its citizens, it is the truest expression of people's sovereignty: a nation where liberty is preserved not through compromise, but through vigilant civic engagement, ideological clarity, and unwavering sacrifice. Governed by the General Assembly and led by the Citizen-President, the Republique practices an assertive, rationalised form of governance where public virtue is enforced, not assumed.

Its institutions operate under the supervision of the Bureau of Virtue, a powerful civic authority responsible for ideological coherence and social conduct. Political parties exist, but only within the framework of the revolutionary consensus. Education, media, and military training are geared toward cultivating the citoyen eclaire: the enlightened citizen. In the Republique, patriotism is a moral duty, and revolution is a continuous process.

The La Marina is compact, modern, and ideologically hardened. It is not just a fighting force but an instrument of republican idealism, often deployed in support of democratic uprisings, anti-monarchist insurgencies, and anti-corporate revolts. Jacobine officers are both soldiers and commissars, trained in both naval tactics and revolutionary philosophy.

To foreign observers, the Republique is paradoxical: a state that preaches liberty while surveilling its citizens, that seeks peace through continual struggle. But to its people, this tension is the Republic's greatest strength. It is not a utopia; it is a crucible in which civic virtue is tested and refined.
"

2559, "     Greater Yamatan Union"

2560, "'Only in duty do we endure'

The Greater Yamatan Union is a techno-feudal empire, rigidly hierarchical and deeply spiritual, where technology serves not to liberate the individual but to perfect their role in society. Governed by the Shogunate under the rule of the High Kensei, the Union merges ancient Yamatan warrior traditions with advanced neural augmentation and biotechnological modification. Every citizen is born into a caste, every action is ritualised, and every war is sacred.

Citizens are stratified by service and obedience. Higher castes receive elite education and enhancements; lower castes perform logistical, agricultural, or menial duties, often in lifelong devotion to their local daimyo. While the system appears oppressive, many citizens embrace it - believing that honour, not freedom, is the highest human value. Education reinforces this through philosophical teachings, martial training, and programmed reverence for the Union's hierarchy.

The Yamatan Navy is compact, elite, and heavily reliant on cybernetic command networks and autonomous squadrons. Each fleet operates as a self-contained shrine of battle - officers duel over disputed targeting solutions, and victory is not merely measured in territory gained but in ritual fulfilment. While the Union avoids foreign entanglements, it reacts with overwhelming force to threats or slights against its honour.

Externally, the Union is regarded as both enigmatic and formidable. Its refusal to modernise diplomatically frustrates its neighbours, but its cultural resilience and strategic discipline make it a long-term player few dare provoke."

2561, "     Rheinische Kaiserreich"

2562, "'A Reich of Steel and Spirit'

A constitutional empire that shares space borders with both the Commonwealth and Combine spheres of influence, the Rheinische Kaiserreich is a proud and industrious state emerging from decades of postwar retrenchment. Once a formidable military power during the Great War, the Reich was left diminished by peace treaties, domestic fatigue, and the loss of key colonial holdings. Under the current Kaiserin, Marianne Therese von Hohenrath, the Reich has embarked on a carefully managed rearmament and industrial modernization campaign, seeking to reclaim strategic autonomy without provoking its more powerful neighbours.

Geopolitically wedged between two superpowers, the Reich has become adept at balancing diplomacy and deterrence. It shares cultural and political affinities with the Alban Commonwealth and maintains cordial, if cautious, relations with it. At the same time, it exports raw materials and heavy industrial goods to the Sinarus Combine, an arrangement viewed as pragmatic necessity rather than ideological alignment. Though its navy is a fraction of its former size, the Reich's forces are well-trained and increasingly well-equipped, favoring quality over quantity. The Kaiserin's government walks a deliberate middle path (neither fully aligned with the Commonwealth nor hostile to the Combine) hoping to preserve stability while rebuilding national strength.

"

2563, "     Aryavartan Subah"

2564, "'Radiance Where Wisdom Reigns'

A resplendent yet disciplined interstellar state, the Aryavartan Subah is a federation of hereditary provinces unified under the throne of the Padshah of Zahirabad. Inspired by the dynastic grandeur and layered administrative systems of Old Earth's Mughal legacy, the Subah blends pageantry with policy.

Although its military projection and political leverage remain modest compared to the Great Powers, the Subah has become an increasingly vital economic actor in the postwar order. A boom in trade and industrial output has fueled rapid modernisation, giving rise to what Subahi thinkers call the 'Second Radiance' - a period of renaissance marked by cultural revival and technological advancement.

The Subah's naval doctrine favours defensive sovereignty, with elegant warships prioritising ablative armour, point defense, and coordinated fighting withdrawal tactics. Though limited in size, the Subah's navy is tightly integrated into its bureaucratic caste system, with officers drawn from the Khilat Order: a hereditary class of warrior-administrators known for their ceremonial regalia and stoic discipline.

Diplomatically, the Aryavartan Subah practices 'Radiant Nonalignment.' It maintains warm trade relations with the Commonwealth and select Combine frontier prefectures, while cautiously navigating ideological distance from the Republique and maintaining neutrality in the Federation-Combine rivalry. While its forces rarely venture far beyond its borders, its diplomats, traders, and cultural envoys are increasingly influential across the Periphery and neutral corridors.

The Subah's strength lies not in force of arms, but in patience, wealth, and vision. Its citizens understand the Padshah's rule is not simply temporal but part of the cosmic balance. And in an age of fire and uncertainty, the Subah offers a rare constant: an empire that neither retreats into the past, nor rushes blindly into the void."

2565, "     Sulsian Hegemony"

2566, "'We Toil As One'

Once envisioned as a federation of enlightened planetary governors and reformist trade lords, the Sulsian Hegemony has decayed into a fractured, cynical regime marred by institutional corruption, economic stagnation, and endemic exploitation. Though blessed with vast reserves of minerals, hydrocarbons, and industrial feedstock, the Hegemony suffers from mismanagement and internal rot. What began as a loose confederation of idealists has curdled into a predatory state propped up by debt, indenture, and fear.

At its core lies Seleste, the decadent and gleaming capital world, home to an opulent oligarchy that cloaks its extravagance in ceremonial hierarchy. While Seleste enjoys luxury and isolation, vast swathes of Sulsian space remain underdeveloped, lawless, and dominated by indentured labour systems. Entire generations toil in orbital refineries or planetary mines, legally bound by debt contracts and overseen by corporate enforcers or regional governors turned warlords.

The Sulsian navy, once a unifying symbol of planetary cooperation, is now a hollowed force - ill-equipped, undertrained, and often outgunned even by pirate fleets. Piracy is rampant, especially along the fringe worlds, where the navy often turns a blind eye in exchange for tribute or unofficial protection deals. Local authorities maintain fragmented control, and paramilitary groups like the Malikan People's Militia - a revolutionary, populist insurrection movement - routinely challenge the Hegemony’s grip on the outer provinces.

Despite its dysfunction, the Hegemony remains a critical economic partner to the Alban Commonwealth, exporting a glut of cheap raw materials in exchange for finished goods, medical supplies, and consumer technology. This trade imbalance has only deepened the dependency of the Sulsian economy on foreign markets. While Commonwealth officials publicly condemn Sulsian human rights abuses, corporate actors and trade ministries quietly benefit from the status quo, sustaining lucrative deals for rare earths, fuel stock, and industrial feed.

Diplomatically isolated and strategically weak, the Sulsian Hegemony endures through inertia, graft, and the convenience it provides to more powerful states. Its ruling class clings to ceremonial grandeur and the illusion of control, while its frontier burns and its people search for salvation - or revolution."

2567, "Non-State Actors"

2568, "Though hyperspace lanes provide natural points of interest and natural roads for expansion, the huge distances involved provide challenges for national governments to maintain the infrastructure required for effective and cohesive running of a state. 

When weaker nations are unable to provide security or maintain the loyalty of their populations, non-state armed groups such as citizen militias, criminal organisations and warlords develop as alternatives to governance by the state. These groups vary widely in capability and goals, but all contribute to the challenges faced by governing states in the 25th century."

2569, "     Malika People's Militia"

2570, "'No Lords. No Chains.'

The Malika People's Militia is a diffuse revolutionary movement composed of miners, defectors, ex-intelligence officers, trade unionists, and disaffected civilians. Originally formed in the wake of a collapsed corporate regime in the Malika Belt, the Militia has since metastasised into dozens of cells scattered across neglected frontier systems. Its structure is loose, its ideology inconsistent, but its message clear: resist the return of oligarchy, seize local autonomy, and dismantle the mechanisms of systemic exploitation.

Militia forces operate out of asteroid colonies, derelict mining platforms, and half-abandoned orbital rigs. While lightly armed and underfunded compared to the navies of major powers, their agility and local support make them a serious threat to colonial garrisons and mercenary fleets. They rely on salvaged equipment, decentralised encryption networks, and sympathetic merchants for supplies. Some factions dabble in piracy; others govern liberated territories with varying degrees of order and legitimacy.

External powers see the Militia as a useful pressure valve - or a dangerous destabiliser. Regardless of what they are called, the Militia endures - fighting, fragmenting, and reforming wherever the promise of freedom collides with the reality of control."

2571, "     Children of Renewal"

2572, "'All Stars Lead to the Promised Land'

The frontiers of Terran Space are a region of intense religious activity. The absence of established institutions and an overwhelmingly practical worldview in a hardscrabble existence divested traditional religious organisations of authority. Ad-hoc spirituality took hold in the region, democratising religion and legitimised individual spiritual expression. Hardship and strong community ties formed the basis of this egalitarian landscape.

The Children of Renewal are a pacifist spiritual movement with roots in frontier Christianity, neo-Mormon theology, and zen-like asceticism. Unlike most factions, they possess no standing army, no territorial ambitions, and no central command. Instead, they operate as a constellation of missionary fleets, humanitarian stations, and outreach settlements - bound together by faith in the coming 'Promised Land' and the belief that all souls, regardless of origin, are equal before the divine.

Children of Renewal vessels travel the edge of settled space, providing medical aid, repairs, and guidance to stranded travellers. They fund their operations through a combination of donations, patronage from wealthy Federation sympathisers, and communal labor. While non-proselytising in tone, they distribute devotional texts, perform religious rites, and offer spiritual counsel to those who seek it.

Many dismiss the Children as eccentric cultists, and their pacifism as naivety. Yet they are quietly respected across the frontier. In lawless systems, a Renewal station is often the only source of order, food, or medicine.

Their influence spreads not through conquest, but through quiet presence. They do not seek converts - they invite wanderers."

2573, "Hyperspace"

2574, "In the late 22nd century, a revolution in space travel was accomplished. An alternative dimension of space-time, hyperspace was first postulated in wormhole theory. By tunneling between two points in 3-dimensional space, a vessel could practically achieve faster-than-light travel without the deterministic complications of actual FTL travel. The first hyperspace drives were cumbersome devices employing vast amounts of energy to fold two points in space and establish a hyperspace tunnel between them.

A second revolution came about through the detection of 'highways' connecting various points in real-space. Not only was the energy requirement far lower to 'enter' and 'exit' hyperspace at these points, travel time was significantly shorter than by the previous method of hyperspace travel. With the discovery of these hyperspace lanes, Terran colonisation of the Orion Arm accelerated at an exponential level. Whilst it is universally accepted that the presence of these lanes has been a boon to our species, the origin of these lanes remains a mystery. Are these lanes a natural byproduct of the hyperspace phenomenon, or were they artificially constructed by technology far in advance of ours?"

3264, "The Atlantean Federation Navy emphasises carrier-centric task forces, long-range missile warfare, and integrated electronic warfare systems. Its doctrine prioritises power projection, force multiplication through strike craft, and layered defence. Federation warships are rugged, modular, and built for sustained operations far from home space. While not always the most advanced individually, their strength lies in coordination, versatility, and numerical superiority. Capital ships often carry powerful missile banks, and destroyers typically serve as escorts and area defense platforms."

3265, "______SINARUS COMBINE______"

3266, "The Sinarus Combine Navy follows a doctrine of overwhelming force, precision strikes, and strict centralised command. It relies heavily on guided missile cruisers, long-range kinetic weapons, and coordinated salvos to neutralise threats before close engagement. Combine warships are austere, heavily armed, and often built around single-purpose roles. While less flexible than other fleets, they excel in planned offensives and system-level domination. Strategic deception, decapitation strikes, and decisive opening salvoes are core tenets of Combine naval operations."

3267, "___REPUBLIQUE JACOBINE___"

3268, "The Republique Navy blends speed, aggression, and independent initiative. Its doctrine emphasises rapid manoeuvre, precision gunfire, and autonomous ship captains executing loosely coordinated thrusts. Republique vessels favour rapid-firing plasma turrets, heavy ASM platforms and advanced propulsion. Their sleek hulls and high-performance reactors support fast raids and hit-and-fade tactics. Though lacking in endurance compared to larger fleets, their ships excel in short, violent engagements and are often first into the breach during coalition operations."

3269, "______YAMATAN UNION______"

3270, "The Yamatan Navy follows an esoteric doctrine shaped by cultural tradition and strategic restraint. Its fleets favour precision over volume, stealth over spectacle. Ships are elegant, often heavily customised, and field exotic technologies like gravimetric weaponry and field dampeners. Yamatan commanders prefer ambushes, asymmetric warfare, and deliberate escalation. While small in number, their warships are crafted with exceptional care and intended for decisive, honour-bound engagements where surprise, misdirection, and timing are paramount."

3271, "_______MINOR POWERS_______"

3272, "The navies of smaller or minor powers vary widely in capability, purpose, and doctrine, often shaped by regional threats and limited budgets. Most maintain compact fleets focused on patrol, commerce protection, and territorial defence. Their ships are typically older designs or foreign-built exports, supplemented by locally modified craft. While few can project power beyond their borders, some (like the Qahtadnan Union) field highly specialised vessels or elite squadrons. Flexibility, diplomacy, and strategic alliances are essential to their survival."

To date, all confirmed artefacts attributed to the alien presence—hereafter referred to as the 'Precursor Constructs'—exhibit design principles and energy scales far beyond human engineering. Gravity manipulation appears routine: stabilised wormhole gates, artificial singularities, and inertial dampening fields are recurrent features. No biological signatures or communication protocols have been identified. The absence of cultural artefacts suggests a machine civilisation or post-organic intelligence. Intent remains unknown. Caution is advised. These technologies were not built for peace, and they were not abandoned by accident."

Looks like those hostile fighter wings didn't give you much trouble. Command believes these are advance scout parties of the main invasion force. If that's the case, expect heavier enemy presence over the next few days as we engage the bulk of the incursion.

Hopefully today's patrol marks the first of many operations alongside the Elam Navy.

Our first combat operation starts tomorrow. Rear Admiral Akrami has authorised a reconnaissance in force to flush out and engage other Qahtadnan assets.

Mission starts at 0700 hours. Rest up until then."

Your fighter has the ability to strafe, reverse thrust and glide. Ensure these controls are bound in the ingame options menu (F2).

3480, "Welcome back Lieutenant Ross. You performed your mission to expectation. Unfortunately it didn't have the outcome we desired.

Federation Defense Intelligence were studying an alien relic. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Combine NavInt somehow found out about Federation experiments and used overwhelming military force to kick FDI out of Mira and steal their research data. The Combine superweapon at Morik was designed using alien technology. That ship we encountered at the artifact must have been Solaris given form.

Ideally we would have wanted to gain control of the artifact. The botched destruction attempt by the Combine instead created an artificial hyperspace junction. The alien relic is out of our reach - for now.

This is where we part ways. You're to transfer to the Athena effective immediately. Captain Fisher is aware and will make the necessary arrangements. She'll drop you off at the Akrotiri system, from there you can make your way back home. I've made the necessary amendments to your service record. You'll have a cover story to explain your absence to the relevant authorities regarding your Federation exchange tour. I'd lay low for the next few weeks just to be safe.

Lieutenant McKearney is accompanying you back home. We have no more need of her services. For now.

Everything you've learned in the past 24 hours is classified Top Secret. We're dealing with advanced nonhuman technology that is beyond anything that our species has encountered or created. No one knows what this technology is fully capable of, but it won't stay secret for long. Before word gets out, we need get as much advantage as we can.

This artifact may be the factor that escalates this conflict beyond the Federation and Combine. This goes beyond old grudges, resources and national pride. The stakes have become too high. Everyone's now fighting for survival."

3555, "So is this it, Quinn? Has His Majesty's government decided to go to war?"

3556, "We're still proceeding carefully. The Miranda Accord is in tatters and the rules don't apply any more."

3557, "Athena is at battlestations. I'm bringing my ship out to engage the Combine forces. Long live the King."

3558, "Commander Quinn, I would appreciate any fire support you could provide."

3559, "Quinn, the Athena's just one cruiser. I don't know if it's enough to win this engagement."

3563, "Athena, this is Merlin. Combine warships systems are powering up again. Expect full combat readiness in twenty seconds."

3564, "That Combine science ship just transmitted a wide band signal. Quinn, can you locate the receiver?"

3565, "What the hell was that?"

3566, "My God...the artifact is powering up!"

3567, "Fine. Do whatever you want Ross. Maybe I was wrong about you."

3568, "We've gone into hyperspace!"

3569, "We're back in normal space. Astrogation, get us a fix on our location."

3570, "Commander, we're in the Gamma Vulpis system. Closest inhabited system is Zeichenfisch, fifty light years away."

3571, "Was that a nuclear EMP warhead?"

3572, "As I said, Lieutenant. The rules no longer apply."

3573, "Is that a black hole? Where the hell are we?"

3574, "Zeichenfisch? That's Rhenaric territory. We're five hundred light years away from Mira."

3575, "Nuclear detonations all around us!"

3576, "They've seeded the artifact with warheads! That pulse must've been a detonation signal!"

3577, "The Combine wanted to deny us the artifact by destroying it. I don't think the activation was intentional."

3578, "What happened? How did we get here?"

3579, "Data analysis complete. The artifact absorbed the power output of the detonations and generated a localised hyperspace bubble."

3580, "Ross, McKearney. Dock your fighters to the Merlin. Astrogation will plot a course to the nearest Commonwealth base. This mission is over."

3581, "TO BE CONTINUED..."

3582, "Tactical, log that destruction. Destroyer Scimitar neutralised."

3597, "Hi Stuart.

I'm happy with your flying ability. To be honest I'm just glad you're not one of those hacks hiding their lack of flight experience to get a job. The way you disabled those mines and the freighter means you're already light years ahead. I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Ferris is happy enough with how things turned out. Sulsian military security has identified the Stargazer freighter as the Samoyed. She's been implicated in 'salvage runs' throughout Sulsian space as well as laying mines for drone sabotage. I hear her crew's keeping tight-lipped. Let's see how long they can stay quiet.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. I hope this is the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

3598, "Mission successful.

Missile warfare in space is a race between seeker and countermeasure development. Large ship-to-ship missiles carry a powerful enough seeker to overcome modern countermeasures. However small anti-fighter missiles can be easily defeated."

3599, "Hi Stuart.

I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Station master Ferris is furious that we lost that Stargazer freighter. We don't know who set the mines there nor who is responsible for the salvage operations. She's threatened to withhold our payment. I had to remind her that technically our mission was to clear the salvage field and find out what happened to her drones. She's grudgingly paid our completion fee, but I don't think she'll be offering us any more contracts at Overton.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. Things can only go up from here, so let's stay positive okay?

It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

3600, "Mission successful.

Warship astrogation systems tend to be less protected than engine subsystems, so if the objective is to prevent a departure it may be quicker to destroy the astrogation subsystem than disabling the engines.

Sometimes the weapons available do not allow for efficient subsystem destruction. In this case destruction of the target becomes the only option."

Compass Rose arrived safely at her destination under the engine power of the Outreach. The executives at Trinity Holdings are delighted with the outcome and have thanked us for recovering the cargo. I hear the injured crew members are all doing okay.

In fact, I hear that Shafer has been fined a hefty amount and his master's license suspended. It seems the Sulsian Merchant Safety Authority wasn't impressed with the way he endangered his ship with that faulty impeller, citing several safety regulations that he breached. Nice to see a regulations agency with some teeth out here. Anywhere else, he'd have gotten away with it."

3972, "Your defense of the Hoshikuzu was outstanding. Those Malikan raiders were serious about taking us out, but we showed them we were more than up to the task. How did the militia group get their hands on top of the line military ordnance?

I'm not too familiar with the Malika People's Militia. All I know is they're a fringe group in conflict with the Sulsian Hegemony, and the closest thing they have to a leader is an ex-soldier called Andri Gadaria. His stated goals are the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination' whatever that means. Up until now they've been running mostly guerilla operations, and despite the Sulsian military's shortcomings, the group have been able to be contained. I've submitted a report of our encounter to the Sulsian Navy. Their threat assessment of the local militia groups needs updating.

The Fringe is a vast, sparsely populated region of space. The Sulsian Hegemony had an iron grip on the major population centres, but corruption and poor infrastructure allowed various militia groups in the region to flourish. Chief among these groups is the Malika People's Militia.

The Malikans were definitely behind the Korra mutiny. In fact, it's starting to look like they've been behind most of the uprisings in Sulsia.

This is a worrying escalation. Those transports were carrying troops to secure their hold on Korra, which means that they aren't just aiming to disrupt Sulsian operations. They plan to occupy assets and territory.

If I didn't know better, I'd say that Andri Gadaria is going beyond his goals of worker liberation. He's building an army.

Energence Industries has paid a bonus to the Hoshikuzu's crew for taking care of the Malikan reinforcements and keeping Navo's men safe. I'm using the extra credits to source some new equipment for the gunships. I'll get Kaur to go through the new cannons with you later."

Admiral Bertini's logistics ship Palos has finished going over our hull. Thankfully we didn't take any critical structural damage. The Hoshikuzu's still got some fight left in her.

The Sulsian government sent out a statement a few minutes before you came in. Andri Gadaria's declared war on the Hegemony, with the attack on the Protogeneia being the first move. Malikan warships are sweeping through Sulsia, there's chaos everywhere. All the trade cartels are pulling out and embassies are evacuating. Everyone's fleeing while they can.

It's too dangerous for us to stay. Once the Hoshikuzu has finished repairs, I'm taking us out of Sulsia. I haven't decided where to take us yet. I'll ask around, see if I can find some safe harbour. I'll let you know soon."

The majority of the Malikan fleet still consists of converted mining ships and transports - low-performance and low-maintenance hulls that the Militia could find and convert at short notice.

The Albans are safe on board Pollux Arrow. They're on their way to Vicare, and so are we. Master Badami on Hopewell reports the Nassau's tow is still secure.

I'm going to need a moment to process what just happened. My cousin...was hired to kill civilians. She destroyed the Elgin. I heard there were dozens of people on that transport who only wanted to flee the war. All dead. It's all so senseless.

I want to apologise for getting you caught up in my family drama, Ross. It was unprofessional of me to involve you in something so personal, and I put everyone under threat because of it. I'm sorry. That being said, I'm grateful for your help. You and Meiks didn't have to get involved, but you did, and I couldn't have done it without you. You two are valued members of my crew, and I don't want you to forget that.

I've put us on a course to Vicare Station. The Pollux Arrow, Hopewell and the Nassau will join us for repairs and resupply.

4393, "It's ok, Ross. This needs to be done, and I know a thing or two about how Kendra fights."

4394, "This isn't going to save your charges Katherine. I'll just cripple your ship and then destroy the transports anyway."

This was supposed to be a simple escort mission in a remote location away from hostile territory. Not only did the Malikans know exactly where to find us, they went out of their way to hunt us down. To add to the disaster, the Pillar of Fire has been commandeered and we barely got away with her crew.

Reverend Lightowler's understandably distraught. I think he's more upset with the setback to the Promised Land journey than the loss of the survey ship. He's assured me that he doesn't blame us for what happened. He plans to take the surviving crew and rejoin the main Renewal congregation. We've been invited to join him.

I have no idea what technology the Malikans were using to mess up our astrogation calculations. At this point it shouldn't surprise me that a cobbled together armada of militia ships should somehow have technology that not even Great Powers have access to. Thankfully Erikson was able to isolate the source of the field. I owe her a drink at Vicare's rec room.

We're running out of luck and out of hiding places. I'm in contact with Navo and Master Badami of the Hopewell. I have a proposition to pool our resources and work together. It's getting to the stage where it's too dangerous for us to work alone."

4481, "Hoshikuzu, something's wrong with our astrogation systems. We can't plot a reliable course out of the Veil. Can you confirm?"

4482, "Something's wrong over here too. It's as though our astrogation systems are skewed. The gravity values keep fluctuating!"

4483, "The fighters are being backed up by strike corvettes. They're moving into range!"

4484, "Gunships, take some pressure off us by disarming those corvettes."

4485, "Here come the missile corvettes! Remember your flares lad."

4486, "Katherine Lau, we've got a problem. Main power is out. There's been a detonation in the reactor room. "

4487, "What? How did it happen? Can you bring your reactor back online?"

4488, "The entire reactor room has been compromised. The damage is too extensive for field repairs."

4489, "I'm making the call to abandon ship. Hoshikuzu, we need you to cover our evacuation."

4490, "Lau, the Malikans aren't here to destroy the Renewal ship. They're disabling and capturing it!"

4491, "I think you're right. Someone led the Malikans here. Probably the same person who sabotaged the Pillar's engines."

4492, "Lau, I've found the source of the gravity anomalies. That Malikan science ship is sending out gravity pulses. They're confusing our astrogation plotters."

4493, "Good work Erikson. Ross, that's your target. Assault the Vehemence and try to disrupt that gravity generator."

4494, "Katherine Lau, this is Lightowler. My crew are in the auxiliary transports. We're commencing detachment from the Pillar."

4495, "Reactor down! Did that work Lau?"

4496, "Good work Ross. That seems to have done the trick. Plotting course out of the Veil."

I thought it would be the Malikans. I was hoping to take a few weeks out at Vicare, maybe help with the evacuation effort and run a few convoy escorts. Turns out there was an even bigger war out there and it's now arrived here.

Long range sensors are picking up Combine ships moving towards Sulsian space and more Federation ships have arrived at Vicare Station. Battlecruisers, frigates and cruisers, it's going to get crowded here very soon and the refugees are going to get caught right in the middle.

Reverend Lightowler's preparing the Renewal and refugee ships to leave. I've let him know my intentions of doing the same. Once all the refugees are off Vicare Station and onto the transports, we leave."

4549, "Instead of complaining about the ordnance you've got, how about I show you how to make them more effective?"

4550, "Just strip out their point defense turrets before you launch. I get it Lau."

4551, "But what if there's a lot of turrets and you're on a time limit? Take out the weapons subsystem, you neuter them all."

4552, "Go ahead and neutralise the Marchana's weapons systems. There's a support drone nearby if you want to rearm."

4553, "This is also a chance to test out your heavy cannons. They take a while to cycle but their damage makes up for it."

4556, "You okay Lau? You look like you haven't slept for days."

4557, "Yeah, just a lot happening lately. Still hung up over Kendra. She needs help, but I can't give it to her and I feel so helpless. What would you do, Ross, if it was your family?"

4558, "My family? I wouldn't know. I've never had them actively trying to kill me. That counts for something right?"

4559, "You know, it's been weeks and I know almost nothing about you Ross. What was your family like growing up?"

4560, "There's nothing to tell. My home was on a glorified tuber farm in a fringe system. Had about as much colour and warmth as the tubers."

4561, "Really Ross? You grew up in a tuber farm?"

4562, "Lau, please. I'm trying to tell you something personal here. This isn't easy for me."

4563, "As one of his very few friends, believe me. This is a rare moment."

4564, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ross. I wasn't laughing at you, really. To be honest, I'm honoured you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Am I the only one you've told this story to?"

4565, "There was...a friend before. I never got round to it. I'm afraid I wasn't a very good friend to her."

4566, "These Stilettos have decent subsystem damage. Thanks Lau."

4567, "Joining up with the Hopewell and Navo was the best idea you've ever had."

4572, "I can register our group as qualified for anti-capship strikes. We'll be in high demand after this."

4573, "You take the lead Ross. Head over to the garrison HQ and we'll go from there."

4579, "All ships are warned to maintain distance from the Thanatos, or we will consider you to have hostile intent."

4580, "Ross, this looks bad. Get back to the Hopewell immediately. Keep away from that Atlantean warship."

4582, "This is an invasion of Sulsian space! Our government will hear of this Captain. You won't get away with this."

4583, "Your government will thank us later when Vicare remains under Sulsian control. The Combine will not be as accommodating as us when they arrive."

4584, "Ross, get the hell away from that battlecruiser! I'm not going down because of this."

Today is giving me the worst headache, and it's nothing to do with the cocktail. My two contract pilots turn out to be Alban navy officers. I don't know what to do with this information.

What you did out there today Ross was...incredible. I don't think we could have made it without you. You proved your initiative and leadership ability when you took command of the fighter wings.

That being said, this complicates things. Not only am I your employer, while you remain a member of the Hoshi's crew I'm also your captain. I was put in command of the fighter group because the Hopewell's pilots knew who I was and were willing to follow my orders. They don't know you Ross, I had to urge them to follow your orders over private comms. This really isn't good enough. This isn't the military but hierarchy still means something in this unit. We need to come up with a better way to establish who's in command. 

Now that I know you've got military command experience Ross I'm more comfortable to give you more autonomy. I just wish you'd told me sooner, not when we're under attack by a Combine rear admiral."

4594, "Rear admirals. Speaking of which. The Combine have occupied Vicare station. The entire system is in lockdown.

And the whole thing only got a passing mention in the news. No story of Kakotchka attacking civilians, no mention of how an entire system got annexed. Just a statement from the Combine how they're there to 'stabilise the growing regional unrest'. Kakotchka should be put to court for war crimes, but like that's ever going to happen. Everyone's too caught up in the new Great War, no one cares what happens out in the fringe.

4672, "That's the fighters taken care of."

4673, "All right. First wave down! That'll be their strikecraft options spent."

4674, "We need to take out that battlecruiser quick. Her guns'll make short work of our ships."

4675, "Then our target is the Zaragoza's weapons subsystem. She'll lose fire control for her mass drivers."

4676, "Ross, I don't understand. Why haven't those cruisers fired another missile barrage?"

4677, "Maybe they're trying to save ammunition, or minimise collateral damage?"

4678, "Lau, Ross. Those cruisers are arsenal ships. They have ammunition for two salvoes only. They're spent and are no longer a threat to us."

4679, "What? How could you know that Erikson? No one's seen these cruisers before."

4680, "I have Lau."

4681, "We've got a lock on the Zaragoza. Kai silos are armed and ready for launch."

4682, "Lau, we're reading an impeller spool on that battlecruiser. "

4683, "I don't believe it! We've driven off the Zaragoza."

4684, "Ross, it's working! The Zaragoza is peeling off!"

4685, "Combine reinforcements have jumped in! A destroyer wolfpack led by a light cruiser."

4686, "Lau, we're losing control of the tactical situation."

4687, "Like we ever had control in the first place."

4688, "This isn't going to work. The transports still need a few minutes of spool. I'm preparing the Nassau to assault the Zaragoza."

4689, "It's going to be rough Navo. I'm bringing the Hoshikuzu alongside to support. You'll need the extra firepower."

4690, "Let's take out their PDCs so our ASMs have a clear run to that battlecruiser. Call out targets for highlight."

4691, "Nassau, Hoshikuzu. Our ships have cleared minimum safe distance. We're commencing impeller spool for hyperspace jump."

4692, "The battlecruiser is impeding our jump vector. We still need to clear that warship's vicinity."

4693, "Civilian transports are away! Good fighting Erikson."

4694, "Oh thank god. Erikson, Navo, get your ships out. All fighters, move to the Hopewell. It's time to leave."

4700, "Ross, that battlecruiser is getting pretty close."

4701, "Erikson, we need to have a talk."

4702, "Bleedin Federation chumps. No fighter cover and letting the Combine get the jump on them. Amateurs!"

4703, "Stay with the convoy Ross! Let the Federation deal with the Combine ships."

4705, "Kaur, warm up the ASM launcher. Let's see what this thing can do."

4706, "The Hopewell! She's going down!"

4707, "There goes Zaragoza weapons control. We've got a bit of breathing space."

We can confirm all Renewal convoy ships are accounted for, with no casualties reported. The Crown is grateful for your assistance, and payment has been forwarded as per contract.

Unfortunately the efforts of Navo's marines to apprehend the crew were unsuccessful. The freighter crew were clearly on a suicide mission and had contingencies in place in the event of capture. There was not enough left of their bodies for a clear identity verification. We have recovered the remains for DNA matching.

I have compiled a report to Crown High Command regarding the events of today. I plan to especially highlight the contributions of Lieutenant Stuart Ross who was crucial to the neutralisation of the nuclear attack. May he continue to serve Sulsia with the same dedication as he serves His Majesty."

4774, "If the ship does have an unstable reactor, it'll pose an explosive hazard to nearby Renewal ships. We will need to isolate and repair the freighter."

4775, "Have you tried contacting the freighter's master?"

4776, "Of course. The only reply is a repeating automatic message citing a comms failure."

4802, "Say again Aria? Have you found a way to deactivate the warhead?"

4803, "Your scan helped pinpoint the freighter's transmitting frequencies to the nuclear warhead. We may be able to repurpose the warhead's receiver."

4804, "We should be able to bypass the detonation trigger by tracing its link to the freighter's computer. We just need scan data of the rest of the subsystems."

4805, "That'll do it. Ensign Holmes, bypass the trigger for the warhead's arming sequence. It won't stop a contact detonation but it's a start."

4806, "Helm, maintain a tight formation to the freighter. That bypass is on a tightrope. If we lose signal integrity at any time, we won't be around long enough to regret it."

4807, "We've bought some time. Alfa 1, disable the freighter's engines. Please be mindful of your aim. A stray shot may well set off the device."

The freighter's electronic manifest originates from Brenner, the Combine system where she allegedly collected the mining equipment. Usually the station commander signs off the shipment before departure is authorised, but this particular convoy was signed off by Rear Admiral Kakotchka herself.  

ANI is collating the data against what we already know of Kakotchka and a case will be made at the International Court of Justice. Fleet Admiral Proctor has already authorised the deployment of a battle squadron to Sulsia to contest Kakotchka's annexation of Vicare Station. Rear Admiral Cleghorn on HMS Formidable will arrive in Sulsia in a few days.

I've signed off on the payment transfer to Katherine Lau's account. Your group did well enough out there. In particular I've made note of your competence in my report to Command. Your performance was instrumental in our success today, and I'll make sure the right people know about it.

I'm taking the Aria to Ladigue station for resupply and service before heading back to our mission at Covenant. This is where we part ways. 

However, there's one more thing. As you know the Arrowhead corvettes have field maintenance facilities for an attending fighter. I would not be averse to having a pilot like yourself as part of my crew when you decide to return to full pay. Think about it, Lieutenant."

The Sulsians are going to bring this to the International Court of Justice. This is a massive breach of the Miranda Accord. We all learned about it at school, it's the foundation for everything our society stands for. Gadaria has the power to bring Armageddon, and the Sinarus Combine gave him this power.

Admiral Bertini's released us from service. Jotram Station has been occupied by Sulsian troops and is now secure, but with Gadaria gone the war will continue on.

The Miranda Accord was drafted in the aftermath of the Great War. Outrage and sorrow over the nuclear devastation of several planets, including Earth, drove the nations of humanity to vow 'Never again'.

The Accord curbs the proliferation of spaceborne nuclear weapons by restricting their use to the Great Powers of the Federation, Combine and Commonwealth. Failure to abide by the treaty would trigger a censure and forcible disarmament by all three Powers. A Great Power in breach of the treaty would also trigger action by the other two Great Powers.

I think I understand Reverend Lightowler better. His Promised Land wasn't just a myth sustaining his religion, but a real place and a source of real power. He has something no one else in the galaxy has - a way to harness this alien technology. I don't know how he did what he did to those bombers but it gives me the chills. How can one man hold so much power? What did he plan to do with it?

I don't know what happened to Covenant. I don't know if Kakotchka and Gadaria got to Lightowler or if he was able to make it out. I guess we'll never know.

Anyway, I want to thank you and Meiks for everything you've done for us. For the Hoshikuzu, for the Nassau and Hopewell, for Sulsia. For helping me with Kendra. I know this really wasn't what you signed up for, I never wanted to drag you guys through all of this. Sulsia's been my home for a long time now. I owed it to this place to make things better. I hope that, in our own little way, we helped.

I don't know what your history is Ross. I don't care. I just want you to know that you've done good out here, and that's all that matters. I'm forwarding double your share of Lightowler's final payment. You deserve it."

5200, "There's a problem with our navigation! We can't calculate a hyperspace exit vector from the system!"

5203, "Everyone here on Covenant thanks you for helping us realise our dream. You should gather your forces and leave promptly. This is not a welcoming place for those who aren't the Lord's Chosen."

5204, "Confirmed. It's the same as when Gadaria attacked us in the Veil. There has to be an interdictor ship nearby."

5205, "We'll deal with that when the time comes. We've got incoming ASMs."

5206, "We're going nowhere until that interdictor ship is destroyed. Can anyone get a lock on that signal?"

5217, "Congratulations Lieutenant Commander. This is a huge outcome. This is the Commonwealth's first victory against the Combine in Sulsia and a huge boost for our operations here.

Every life lost in His Majesty's service is given to make the galaxy a better place. The crew in the decoy transports were volunteers who understood the sacrifices that duty asked of them. They'll be commemorated as heroes back home. You can rest assured your performance today ensured that their sacrifice was not made in vain.

The threat of Kakotchka's arsenal ships was so severe, Admiral Cleghorn had ordered contingency plans be drawn up even before Formidable's battle group arrived in Sulsia. Failure today would have forced Cleghorn to reassess and scale back Combined Task Force operations in Sulsia. We've now been given a green light to proceed as planned."

5218, "Commendable work in protecting Commander Audun and his crew. It was a highly fluid combat environment with multiple ASM and striker threats. Your propensity for rapid action and flexibility is quite an advantage. Don't ever lose it LC.

I'm glad my impressions you were the right person for Aria are justified, and hopefully this will ease Captain Tierney's mind about bringing you back into the Fleet. Here's to more missions like these."

5219, "Our victory is tempered by the loss of Commander Audun and the crew of the Nashira. Like those in the decoy transports, they knew the risks going in. Understand though, that your duty as a pilot required you to keep them safe and alive.

Bertini's great offensive went off in typical Sulsian fashion. There was little to no coordination between Hegemony and Commonwealth forces. Despite this, we did what had to be done and Guardador will once again start filling Sulsian coffers. Sometimes you've just got to take what you can get.

The Sinarus Combine are of course playing this up as much as they can. War Secretary Szekerka's brought out the entire checklist for this one: condemning 'Commonwealth attacks against civilian targets' and our 'illegal occupation of Sulsian territory'. Look his speech up if you need a laugh. If you want an idea of what the Combine are up to, pay attention to what they're accusing others of doing.

Listen. I know you've been away from Fleet for a while and I don't know what discipline standards Erskine Station maintained when you were there. You're a Lieutenant Commander now, which means you hold a command rank. More than ever you need to uphold Crown Navy standards of behaviour.

5406, "From small leads come great breakthroughs.

This is a massive escalation. The Malikan war goes further than Admiral Kakotchka and the Combine. The Yamatan Union is providing weapons to Gadaria's forces. Not just any weapons, but advanced stealth missiles beyond anything the Malikans could have produced themselves.

We don't know how many missiles the Malikans have got their hands on, but our intervention today prevented a dozen more from ending up in Gadaria's armory. All the more reason we need to resolve the situation in Sulsia quickly before more damage is done."

5407, "The transport you two found was the Aegina, an independent trade ship that was lost several days ago. She went missing while transiting Multnomah. We're not sure how she ended up in the asteroid cluster. She may well have been responding to a separate distress signal herself. 

The transport was attacked by heavy weapons and left to drift powerless. We can confirm there were no survivors by the time you and Anouilh arrived. Likely another victim running afoul of Combine or Yamatan forces in the field.

The Sulsians will mark the asteroid field as a no-fly zone to hopefully prevent another such tragedy from happening."

5505, "Take point, Lieutenant Commander. I've got your back."

5506, "Got a weak signal out near the waypoint. Do you see it too Ross?"

5507, "Yeah. We'll get better readings as we close the distance."

5508, "Looks like a nav beacon ahead."

5509, "It must've been deployed recently. Sulsian charts don't reference any nav buoys around here."

5510, "Assuming you can trust Sulsian charts in the first place. But yes. If it's not the Sulsians, it's got to be the Malikans."

5511, "Able 1, get a scan on that buoy and download the nav and sensor data. Sensor range is still limited, so stay alert for any surprises out there."

5512, "Scan data received. Not much to work with. If the Malikans have a base out here, they're keeping it quiet."

5513, "We'll just have to keep looking. Ross, there's another faint sensor blip on radar. Shall we check it out?"

5514, "<intercepted> Shit! Shit! We got Alban fighters here!"

5515, "Malikan fighters! Engage at will!"

5516, "Right. Fighters down. Sounded like they didn't expect us either."

5517, "Ross, another nav beacon. We must be on the right track."

5518, "Short range fighters. That confirms it. There's definitely a Malikan base or carrier in this cluster."

5519, "There. Faint signal just lit up. Maybe the beacon activated something?"

5520, "Let's keep an eye out in case we run into another Malikan patrol."

5521, "<intercepted> Help me...is anyone there, please...!"

5522, "What the hell is that?"

5523, "A distress call. Low power carrier signal. Probably nearby."

5524, "It's probably bait. The Malikans trying to lure transports into an ambush."

5525, "Maybe...but all the way out here? With a base nearby that's supposed to be hidden?"

5526, "Looks like this is the source of the transmission."

5527, "It's a derelict. No power, no transponder. No survivors."

5528, "Maybe. But someone definitely sent that transmission. I think it's still worth a look, no?"

5529, "Able 1, we've confirmed location ping. Continue your mission. The commander's authorised a support drone deployment to the transport."

5530, "That girl's long dead. It's an automated message looping for who knows how long."

5531, "The drone will conduct a forensic investigation on the transport. It can scan for survivors and recover the black box. "

5533, "Wait, got a cluster of new sensor contacts. Too faint to get a firm reading."

5534, "Looks promising. I'm game if you are."

5535, "Asteroid mining base ahead! This must be what the Malikans were hiding."

5536, "Ross, watch the CIWS platforms. Malikan turrets have a nasty sting."

5537, "Engage the missile corvette and take out those turret emplacements!"

5538, "That missile boat is vectoring away. Do we pursue?"

5539, "Right. That'll do it for the defenses. Aria, we've found a Malikan mining base. Should be clear for the Sulsians to take over."

5540, "Able 1, perform an active scan on the mining station. We need data on personnel complement and internal defenses for Bertini's fire teams."

5541, "This is an anticlimax. A mining station is nice I suppose, but I was expecting something...bigger. More exciting."

5542, "Receiving data now. That station is fully automated. No crew. No defenses. Ore is set aside in storage for pick up by transports."

5543, "Hang on Aria. That's not the end of it. Another signal just came up on radar."

5544, "The data included navigation maps of the entire asteroid field. There's a lot of traffic leading into a cluster of large asteroids nearby."

5545, "That must be what our sensors are picking up. I knew there was more to this."

5546, "Ross! Are you okay? Those were Yamatan fighters!"

5547, "...It's an ambush! Break and engage!"

5548, "I think so. Those Huns gave a tough fight. "

5549, "I think we've just hit something big. What's the Yamatan Union doing in Sulsia?"

5550, "The Huns are barely human. They're brutal. The only reason they do anything is to hurt us."

5551, "Got another cluster of signals nearby. This might be what we're looking for."

5552, "Aria, got a lot of signals near us. There may be a significant hostile presence. Have the Assurance stand by."

5553, "Copy Able 1. Be advised Captain Lockerbie has already signalled readiness."

5554, "This is it. Cargo depot with multiple warships. Pretty dense sensor shadow, it's no wonder we couldn't see them."

5555, "Fighters launching from that Combine frigate."

5556, "This is too much for us to handle without support. Aria, do we disengage?"

5557, "Able 1, do not engage those warships. Assurance is on her way. Form up with the cruiser when she arrives."

5558, "Captain Lockerbie on Assurance. Heard you had some bad company that needs sorting out."

5559, "Helm, bring us to range. Able and Alfa, support our approach but don't overextend yourself. We've got it from here."

5560, "Good to hear from you Assurance. Command has given the go-ahead to engage freely. Happy shooting."

5561, "Thank you Commander. Cleghorn's been drilling our crews for months. That rabble will soon feel the fury of a Crown heavy cruiser."

5562, "Captain, hostile ships approaching guns range."

5563, "Very good. Ensign, give them plasma. Long live the King."

5569, "No hostiles remaining. That was good shooting Assurance."

5570, "Nothing more than expected from a ship in His Majesty's service. We'll remain in the area until the depot and mining station are secured. We'll use the opportunity to attend to our battle damage and wounded."

5571, "Ross, are you reading this? Got a series of containers, quite small but sensors are having trouble picking them up."

5572, "They look almost like missiles. Strange geometry on the casing. Could be stealth platforms."

5573, "They're stealth missiles LC. Yamatan make. Looks like you've just interrupted a weapons transfer."

5574, "Those missiles hold no intelligence value. Destroy them. Leave the cargo trays for procurement. I'm sure the Sulsians could find a use for the supplies."

5575, "Damn it! Where the hell are you Anouilh?"

5576, "That's a wrap LC Ross. Good work. I'll let Admiral Bertini know the asteroid field is secured."

5577, "Remain in the area with Assurance. We'll move to your position for you to dock. Cameron out."

5578, "Good enough for me. Let us continue hunting ghosts in this tomb of space."

5579, "It was nice working with you Lieutenant Commander Ross. We made a good team today."

5580, "Thank you Anouilh. I hope I wasn't too offhand with you. Thanks for watching my back."

5581, "You make a refreshing change from the usual, Ross. Commonwealth pilots can be so stuffy and drab at times."

5582, "Refreshing? Never been called that before. I can work with that."

5583, "Malikan gunships inbound!"

5584, "Danger, darkness and dust. If Death was in space, this is where he'd live."

5585, "The field's messing up my sensors. It looks like another signal just came up on radar."

5586, "Might be real. Might not. Only one way to check."

5587, "It's a Stargazer freighter!"

5588, "Should we be surprised to see one here?"

5589, "It's a tray with engines. The Malikans use it to ferry fighters into combat. Sometimes suicide drones. No, I'm not surprised at all to see it here."

5590, "Engines are out on this one though. This won't be ferrying anything around."

5591, "Power's on, so it's still being used. Maybe an automated support platform for patrols?"

5592, "So Ross. You're the only fighter pilot on HMS Aria, no?"

5593, "Yes. Isn't that normal?"

5594, "Well. Yes, it is normal. But I was hoping the Commonwealth did it differently."

5595, "Differently? Like having more than one? The Navy needs pilots everywhere, it'll be a waste."

5596, "It can be lonely though...being the only one aboard who understands the thrill of the chase. Who can taste the rush of the drugs before combat."

5597, "At least, it is for me. I was curious to see if it was the same with you. You and I are both in the same situation."

5598, "Look, I get what you're trying to say. Everyone's been saying it to me for years. Being alone, it suits me just fine."

5599, "Some people need the connection, I get it. Maybe most people do. But it's not for me. It never has been."

5600, "What the hell are you talking about Anouilh?"

5601, "Oh, I'm sorry Ross. Was I being inappropriate?"

5602, "If that's true, Ross, you'll be the first person I've met who doesn't need it."

Surviving ships from the battle are filtering in at Herdemin Station. The Malikans have been harassing the stragglers all the way to the Sulsian capital. It's been a rout, almost total losses. The Sulsian Navy...has been extinguished.

Even though Commonwealth casualties were relatively light, we still got hit hard. HMS Assurance will need weeks on the Ladigue drydock. It looks like a similar amount of time for our ships to replace crew casualties.

Kakotchka played Bertini like a damnable puppet. She knew he'd disregard a light screen of picket ships, he took the bait - hook, line and sinker. She had his temperament down to the last detail. I bet her intelligence people even knew what he had for breakfast that day. The battle was over before it even began.

At a stroke, Kakotchka's removed one fleet off the board, while still remaining in control of Vicare and still having her arsenal ships in play. The loss of the gravity ships will limit her tactical options, but she knows we'll have to move against her soon. All she has to do is wait for us to come to her, then hit us hard with an overwhelming missile attack.

That's a problem for Cleghorn's pay grade. He gambled on Vicare, and he can deal with the consequences. I only care about the wellbeing of my crew. Aria will refuel and repair the worst of the battle damage at Herdemin before limping back to Ladigue Station. You're off duty for the next few days. Spend some time with the crew. Get to know them, and report your findings to XO Ellis. That's an order, LC."

5792, "Welcome back Lieutenant Commander. You completed your mission despite the most adverse of circumstances. The flame of duty burned brighter than the fires of Combine warheads. You and your crew embody the ideals that all King's Officers strive for.

Due to your successful mission, the balance of power has shifted in our favour. Erikson's intelligence on Combine missile systems will be critical, and Lau has relations with the Children of Renewal that we can leverage. 

I'm sorry to hear about Aria's losses. Doctor McGill reports at least one third of the crew are dead or incapacitated. Your crew's actions saved Cameron's life, but her recovery will take weeks, if not months. 

I can find people to bring Aria's crew back up to complement, but replacing senior command staff will be difficult. I'd bring in an officer from another ship to replace Commander Cameron, but our numbers are still depleted from the Vicare operation and no such officer is available. That being said, we have an alternative.

Admiral Cleghorn's approved your assignment as Aria's commanding officer. You'll hold the rank of acting Commander for the duration of this assignment. Congratulations.

You won't be going into the cockpit again anytime soon. I don't need another pilot. I need Aria at the right place, when the decisive moment arrives.

You've got a lot of work ahead of you Commander, but I'm sure you'll do the Navy proud. Long live the King."

5886, "Sir, our orders were to bring back Lau and Erikson. Do we continue the mission or return home?"

5909, "Crown Navy warship Aria. The station has been locked down under orders from the Sinarus Combine Navy."

5910, "The Combine fleet are enforcing the lockdown with armed troops. They say they are hunting fugitives, and that no one is to leave the station while they conduct the search."

5911, "Fugitives? Did they give the names of who they're looking for, Andaman?"

5912, "No names. Master Batra offered the help of station security services, but the Combine refused to give any details of the individuals in question. The lack of information in addition to the lockdown has become a cause for agitation."

5913, "Not being transparent? Does that sound like something the Combine would do? Let me talk to them."

5914, "Andaman Station, this is Stuart Ross, CO of Aria. We are here to provide asylum for two individuals who may be on board. They may be the ones the Combine are looking for."

5915, "If you help us find and evacuate them, it may bring about the end of the lockdown."

5916, "Sinarussian troops are all over the station and their warships will likely come back soon. We don't want to be the target of Combine retributions if we help you."

5917, "Leave the Combine to us, Andaman. Ross out."

5918, "Sir. I'm not discounting Aria's combat ability but if there's a significant Combine asset out here, we may not be able to resolve an engagement."

5919, "Yes Ensign. I know. But if we manage to get our people quickly, we'll be out of here before any such engagement takes place."

5920, "Two Combine Light Attack Craft are on an intercept! Recommend evasive manoeuvring to avoid their heavy cannons!"

5921, "Combine LACs destroyed!"

5922, "We can assist, but finding details of their arrival will be difficult. The Combine have commandeered our computer systems and locked us out of our own records."

5923, "Well, we better make it quick. The Combine marines will have definitely noticed our arrival. Wouldn't surprise me if they're already on comms to their friends."

5924, "Alert! Khopesh-class frigate on sensors, she's moving to engage us!"

5925, "Solomnent frigate is spooling her impeller. Looks like we mauled her badly."

5926, "Combine frigate destroyed, sir. Catastrophic detonation."

5927, "Sir, I may be able to access the Andaman records remotely. Aria has powerful comms technology, it's how we managed to defuse the nuclear device at Covenant."

5928, "If we get close enough to the docking berths for a remote scan, I may be able to find an access point to their systems."

5929, "I've got them! Section 35-C, room 281. Rental accommodation under the pseudonym Noemi Pasquale, biometric record matches Lau. Confined to their room until the lockdown ends."

5930, "Can you get in contact with them?"

5931, "Aye sir. A simple case of an external comms directly to their room's terminal. One second."

5932, "HMS Aria, is that you?"

5933, "Lau? This is Stuart Ross. Are you and Erikson okay? And...Pasquale?"

5934, "Stuart? It's good to see you again. The name was Erikson's idea, in case we got tracked. I guess it turned out to be useful. Where is Anil Cameron?"

5935, "We were attacked on arrival to Andaman and suffered casualties. Cameron is incapacitated. I'm acting CO."

5936, "Wow Ross, your first command. You know, being captain of a ship kinda suits you. I'm glad you're ok."

5937, "Right. We need to get you and Erikson out of Andaman and onto Aria. Can both of you make it to a docking ring?"

5938, "Security's locked down the entire station, and Combine troops are crawling all over. Not without overriding the security lock or getting the lockdown lifted."

5939, "Stand by Lau. I'll get back to you when we've got a plan."

5940, "Combine fighter wing! They must have recalled a patrol."

5941, "Heads up, sir! Faint signals incoming. Combine IFF!"

5942, "Reading more signals incoming! They're fast, likely more fighters!"

5943, "They're swarming us!"

5944, "Sir! Message from the hangar. Maintenance has cleared out our combat drones. They've been made flight worthy. We can launch them to help out against the fighters."

5945, "Area clear. Do we continue to Andaman Station?"

5946, "All fighters destroyed. No other hostile contacts for now."

5947, "Lieutenant Kelly, get me Andaman's master. I want our people off that station now."

5948, "This is Master Batra. I hear this is your fault the Combine have locked down my station. Who are these fugitives? Why have you got us involved in your war?"

5949, "Master Batra, listen to me very carefully. This lockdown is the fault of the Combine, and the Combine alone. They only care about getting what they want, and your station just happens to be an obstacle."

5950, "Obstacle? We become an obstacle as soon as we help you. We have no quarrel with the Archon. Why shouldn't I just let the Combine have these fugitives? What has the Commonwealth done for us?"

5951, "Because this is what a galaxy under Combine rule looks like. If you care at all about your people, this is our best chance of stopping that from happening."

5952, "This is how the Combine operate. They come to a system, lock it down and occupy it until they have no more use for it. I've seen them do it in Sulsia. They're doing the same thing here. They'll do it all again after this is over."

5953, "You ask what the Commonwealth's ever done for you? This! This is what we're doing. We're stopping them right here, right now! And you have a chance to help us do it."

5954, "All right, Alban. You say you're opposing the Combine? Show me. I'll have my security chief create a diversion in that section, make up an emergency to force the Combine to evacuate."

5955, "Your friends are near a transport berthed at C Dock. The way should be clear for them once the troops evacuate. In return, I want your ship to protect my station from any Combine warships once they find out what's going on."

5956, "Tell your people to move out in about two minutes. Hopefully we all get out of the other side of this in one piece."

5957, "High energy signals on approach! Two frigate-sized ships, with what look like strike craft escorts."

5958, "Well we got ourselves in the thick of it now. Stand by to engage new contacts."

5959, "Got confirmation of two Combine destroyers! Escorting striker wing and two LACs! They're closing in."

5960, "Sir! We're in range of their mass drivers!"

5961, "The bastards are firing at civilians!"

5962, "Stuart, this is Lau. We're making our way to the transport at Dock C. The dockmaster tells me we're good to launch in about one minute."

5963, "Don't launch yet! There are Combine warships near the docking rings. They'll fire on any transport leaving the station!"

5964, "Get in the transport but stay powered down. Await our signal to launch."

5965, "<secure> Stuart, we're in the transport. Her pilot's standing by for your signal."

5966, "We need to stay out of range of those mass drivers or we'll get hammered!"

5967, "Striker wing peeling off to attack Aria!"

5968, "Stuart, what's happening out there? We've been advised that Combine troops are on their way to Dock C. We won't be able to hold them back for long."

5975, "Sir, we've got confirmation that Lau and Erikson are on board Aria."

5976, "Thank God. Helm! We've done what we need to do. Get us a course out of here!"

5977, "Copy Lieutenant. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Helm, take us home."

5978, "Sir. I think that's everyone. Both destroyers neutralised. Escorting wings destroyed."

5979, "System exit vector calculated. Impellers ready."

5982, "$3$ to launch anti-fighter beam drones"

5983, "Well everyone, I'm willing to take suggestions."

5984, "Those Combine guns are powerful, but slow. If Lieutenant Ryan can keep us evasive and unpredictable, we can minimise incoming damage."

5985, "I suggest we carve up the Combine formation piecemeal, instead of engaging them all at once. Strikers and LACs first, to give us time to plan our engagement with the destroyers."

5986, "Sir, our plasma cannons don't do much against warship hulls but they burn through subsystem and turret armour like no one's business."

5987, "Might I suggest keeping distance until they send their strike wings at us. Once we've dealt with them, we make best speed to the destroyers and take out their fire control."

5988, "Lau...what's the deal with Erikson? Why are the Combine hunting her too?"

5989, "It's ok Lau. It's time Ross knew the truth. There's no need to hide anymore."

5990, "Ross, I was a senior developer in one of the Sinarus advanced weapons research departments. My team helped develop the burst anti-ship missile for the arsenal ships."

5991, "I heard rumours of a terrible weapon called 'Black Sun' but it wasn't until Morik that the full horror was revealed. I had to leave. I left the Combine under an alias."

5992, "I knew Black Sun originated in the Veil, so I came to Sulsia to try to stop it, somehow. I joined up with Lau on the Hoshikuzu. And the rest you now know."

5993, "Of course. That's why the admiral needs Erikson. She's the key to Kakotchka's arsenal ships."

5994, "I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier Stuart. Erikson told me after we left Sulsia, and asked me to keep it private."

5995, "Corvette Aria, there are Combine warships near our station and we have no weapons to defend ourselves. We need you to drive them off."

6042, "First Lord,

I am writing to apprise you of developments following the loss of contact with TG Formidable during Operation Veil-1. At approximately 1330 hours Albion Standard Time, an anomalous hyperspace transition event resulted in the displacement of HMS Aria, the independent vessel Hoshikuzu, and RLM Glaive. The ships re-emerged in the Mira system, approximately one thousand light-years from the Pallavian Veil. These vessels were intercepted by a Federation fighter patrol from FNS Colossus. Rear Admiral Akrami has forwarded preliminary sensor data, logs, and testimonies from the involved crews. His initial intention was to impound the ships for further investigation. However, he elected to release them.

I have communicated my appreciation to Rear Admiral Akrami for his decision to avoid escalation. That said, the implications of this event are unprecedented. We are in possession of fragments of telemetry suggesting a Precursor device was activated in orbit of Veil-1's black hole. This device selectively disassembled ships - both friend and foe - before Reverend Lightowler, by all accounts, initiated a secondary Precursor mechanism. All hyperspace corridors to the Gaia world have been sealed and stellar cartography reports the disappearance of the Veil-1 black hole. The Mira artifact has also vanished. No physical trace remains.

At this time, there is no access into or out of the Gaia system. The Combine has been denied control of the Precursor artifacts, but so have we. Alexander, I recommend immediate coordination with the Foreign Office and Advanced Threat Initiative committee members before making any public statements. I also recommend that we recall HMS Aria to Albion for urgent debrief and technical audit, under Crown Navy Special Directive 14.

Fleet Admiral David Proctor, Office of the Crown Admiralty"

The Euphrates and Artemis will spend the next week undergoing repairs at Durius Installation. I've authorised leave for the ship's staff and air crew.

Ahab, I hear our newest pilots are yet to receive call signs. Take the opportunity to hold a Naming. Durius Installation has decent recreational facilities - just keep the noise down.

Once our ships are combat ready, we'll join up with the rest of the Task Group in the Akkad system to help mop up remaining Qahtadnan forces."

High performance small craft have significant thrust to mass ratios that subject their pilots to pronounced stress when accelerating. Pharmaceutical therapy allows pilots to tolerate - and survive - these G-forces.

Known as the 'cocktail', the drugs are a combination of inotropes, stimulants and vasoconstrictors to increase cardiac output, cerebral perfusion, cognitive speed and alertness. Use of the cocktail is highly supervised by medical officers, but long term use carries a toll. Pilot retirement often happens at much younger ages than with other naval branches."

Captain Lancaster, FNS Longview. Sounds like you two have been through hell. We've heard about everything that happened in Durius, all the battles the Artemis fought and survived. Now she's just one more casualty of the Combine war machine.

Fifth fleet has been pulverised by the Combine. I command what little is left. The Combine have initiated a full scale invasion of Morik and we're continuing the fight as best as we can. It's a real mess out here.

I've authorised your transfer to the Longview. Any assistance you two could give would be appreciated. The Longview's air wing is critically short of equipment and personnel, experienced pilots like you two will make a world of difference.

XO, bring them downside. There's plenty of spare quarters for them to occupy. You two will  hear from me soon. The fight for Morik's nowhere near over. "

6464, "Mission successful.

The Combine Navy battle doctrine emphasises overwhelming 'First Strikes' with large-calibre weapons and heavy missiles. Combine battlecruisers with their balance of mobility and firepower are the product of this doctrine.

6548, "Lieutenant Ross, this is an excellent outcome. We found a treasure trove of ammunition, parts and equipment. It was a gamble but looks like we managed to pull it off. The icing on the cake is the destruction of the cruisers Venturous and Stella Polare. More strain will be placed on Romanowska's remaining forces in Morik.

Fifteen minutes ago, nuclear bombers flying off the carrier Imperatrix glassed Juliet Base. We'd already secured all the supplies we needed and took no further losses, but the base is now a tomb.

We've had a preliminary look at the Combine research data. As expected, there's high-level encryption. The algorithm is one that Federation Defense Intelligence uses. Without an FDI counter-algorithm we can't decrypt the data. The Combine get to keep their secrets for now.

You'll be pleased to know the Juliet hangars contained Phantom-class stealth fighters in spaceworthy condition. With some minor maintenance they've been made mission ready and should be available for deployment at the next sortie. Yeah, I knew you'd like that.
"

6549, "Unfortunately, things didn't go as smooth as I'd like. We had to deploy LACs to take out the Combine cruisers. I know this mission was critically important, but I'd prefer not to expose these craft to enemy fire. Resources are scarce enough."

Just so we're clear, I don't want what we're about to discuss spreading freely through the ship. Bad for crew morale. Limit discussions to senior officers only. 

We're in a bad spot. Task Force 57 is gone. Fifth Fleet is gone. I've heard nothing from Lincoln and Akkad. We may have to scrap our plans of retaking Morik.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, I don't get to make that decision. What happens next is up to Admiral Colvin.

Your mission is complete, McKearney. Pace will debrief you. The decrypted Juliet base data gives us the last clue that we need, a set of coordinates where we can find the source of the Federation's - now Combine's - superweapon. Your performance has been commendable and I'll note as such in your file - strictly off-record, of course.

We're chasing the greatest threat to the Commonwealth ever faced. It's nothing less than Armageddon. A planet-destroyer, perhaps something more. Bombing Earth in the last war wasn't enough for the Atlanteans. Now it seems their own weapon's been turned against them. Unlucky sods.

Our mission is to find out what exactly the Combine stole from the Federation, capture it if we can, and destroy it if we can't. These are orders straight from His Majesty King Edward himself. 

The Merlin's going to Mira. The Combine base which your Artemis assaulted was a secret Federation Defense Intelligence facility that the Combine commandeered several weeks ago. The Artemis assault was FDI covering their own backsides. Something's in that system that the Federation wanted to keep hidden, and we're going to find it.

Lieutenant Ross, thank you for your assistance in giving us this breakthrough. Be advised that everything you've learned today is classified. Once we're out of Morik I'll make plans to exfiltrate you off the Merlin."

6864, "You told me it's like you can't trust anything I say anymore, but I've never lied to you directly. Everything I've told you, where I'm from, my family back home, it's all real."

6865, "ANI recruited me when I applied for the Federation exchange program. The whole time on Artemis I was an intelligence agent. Pace was my case officer."

6866, "I had to keep it secret, Ross. I couldn't blow the operation. No one could know about it, not even friends like you. I hope you realise this, now that you've seen what's happening."

6867, "Something big's coming that will shape the future of the Commonwealth and we need to be prepared."

6890, "KATHERINE LAU - OVERTON ORBITAL"

6891, "Hi Stuart. Welcome to Sulsia. Thanks for applying for my job listing. I hear you've come all the way from the Alban Commonwealth."

6892, "I'm Katherine Lau, captain of the corvette Hoshikuzu. I'm putting together a crew for some contract work. I could use a good pilot."

6893, "Sulsia will be our area of operations. It's out in the fringes of colonised space but it's still a major trade hub. The Sulsian Hegemony exports a large number of mineral resources for manufacturing."

6894, "It's a huge frontier and the Sulsian navy's spread thin. Alban Commonwealth cruiser patrols used to keep order out here but with the war and all, they've all been pulled back home."

6895, "Now the trade corporations are having to fill the gaps left behind by hiring independents for security. This is a good opportunity to make some coin."

6896, "As far as I can tell your certifications look good enough, but I want to see your skills for myself. The Hoshikuzu's still undergoing upgrade work so I'm taking the opportunity to run a performance assessment."

6897, "I've accepted a contract on your behalf from Lupe Ferris, the Overton station master. A single pilot like yourself should be able to pull this off."

6898, "As you've probably seen on your way in, Overton Orbital is a graveyard for decommissioned ships. Station salvage drones comb the field for useful scrap which gets processed here and then sold on the market."

6899, "Ferris says several drones have been lost while on salvage missions - as in, more and more aren't returning to the station."

6900, "These drones work autonomously, they aren't tracked or kept in sensor contact. A lot of this is unavoidable, the debris creates a lot of signal noise."

6901, "The station sensors have also detected low-energy signals out in the field. The debris chunks are all inert, so there shouldn't be anything out there."

6902, "Ferris wants someone to go out and see what's generating those signals. If you can find out what's happening with the drones, that'll be a bonus too."

6903, "Your gunship is berthed in the station hangar. She's one of two custom-built craft."

6904, "They were both in pretty good condition when I found them in the Overton field, and with modifications they're tough little birds."

6905, "We might as well use the opportunity to see how well they fly with a pro at the stick."

6906, "So, that's your mission Ross. A little ghost-hunting to start off your time here. I'll talk to you again when you're out in the field."

6909, "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU"

6910, "Welcome aboard, newcomer! Please take a moment to read through this orientation guide to familiarise yourself with the Hoshikuzu and her crew."

6911, "The Hoshikuzu is a one-of-a-kind corvette that started life as a Rasputin-class transport before being sold for scrap."

6912, "She was salvaged and converted into an armed corvette by Katherine Lau, her current captain."

6913, "Her reactor and impeller was replaced with a military-grade unit, and her engines operate at more than two hundred percent efficiency. She is a hare with a lion's heart."

6914, "Along with her new 40mm chaingun PDCs, she carries two gunships and several repair drones for support."

6915, "Katherine Lau is the ship's captain. She decides who joins and leaves the ship. All who work hard are welcome. Those who misbehave are asked to leave."

6916, "Derek Kaur is the ship's engineer and keeps the power running. He's a Great War veteran, and he loves only vodka more than machines."

6917, "Verma Erikson runs tactical and weapons. She's a mystery but no one knows guns better than her. If you manage to find out anything about her past, share it with me."

6918, "Dodo Meiks is one half of the gunship pilot team. He's a Caledonian through and through and is the only one that can match Kaur drink for drink."

6919, "Finally there's Stuart Ross, the other gunship jockey. He's a bit of a lone wolf, but you can depend on him for anything."

6920, "I hope your time aboard the Hoshikuzu is a positive experience. If you have any questions about this orientation guide, just send over a comms."

6921, "DEREK KAUR - HOSHIKUZU"

6922, "Kaur"

6923, "Hello Ross. You're probably wondering how I fit into this family. A few weeks ago I helped Lau outfit the Hoshikuzu with the new reactor, and I figured I might as well stay for the ride."

6924, "Lau's rewarded me with the jobs she doesn't want to do herself, so I'm running double duty on reactor and gunship maintenance. I'll be the one maintaining your craft."

6925, "I don't know if Lau told you yet, but I think you should know ahead of time. I'm Combine, of old Sol vintage. I remember when we used to rule the galaxy, back before the Great War."

6926, "These Sinarussians, they do things a little differently but I don't follow most of it myself. I leave the politics to the politicians. You live long enough, you make peace with the things you can't control."

6927, "So, your gunships. They're versatile little machines that can mount most weapon systems out there. Right now we're limited to basic equipment, but things will change when Lau gets us some more advanced weapons."

6928, "Unfortunately I can't do much about their agility. Having said that, the engines are powerful enough and can get you to a decent speed, so long as you fly in a straight line."

6929, "Anyway, it's good to meet you Ross. If you need anything for your gunship, or just want advice from someone who's seen it all, come find me. Welcome aboard."

6930, "Hey Meiks, Ross. Look who's just scored our first contract?"

6931, "Our client is Trinity Holdings, a major trade cartel headquartered here at Azar station. They've posted out a contract to investigate a distress call from one of their freighters."

6932, "The call came from the Compass Rose, a cargo freighter enroute to the Multnomah system. She dropped out of hyperspace with an unspecified 'engine failure'."

6933, "The Compass Rose dropped out near several star systems with known pirate activity. She's a sitting duck for vultures looking for easy prey."

6934, "No details on what to expect, but the Hoshikuzu and your gunships should have more than enough firepower to deal with any raiders we're likely to encounter. Your gunships are fully stocked with kinetic rounds and missiles."

6935, "Our mission is to safeguard the Compass Rose and her cargo while rendering assistance to her crew."

6936, "Since this is going to be your first outing with us, I'll go through the game plan once more before we head out."

6937, "Your gunships are too small to have their own hyperspace impeller, so you two will ride docked on the Hoshikuzu's fighter rails when we enter hyperspace."

6938, "Once we enter the area, undock your gunships from the Hoshikuzu to initiate flight operations."

6939, "You'll be weapons free after that. Watch your fire though, the Hoshikuzu may be armoured but I don't want her to take any more damage than she needs to."

6940, "That's all I've got for now. If there's no questions, get to your gunships. We jump when you're confirmed secure."

6945, "As I've said before this region's been descending into a shitshow for a while, but this is the worst it's been."

6946, "Word around the trade cartels is that there's worsening unrest with industrial workers all around Sulsia. Something's got the roughnecks riled enough to drop tools. "

6947, "The Sulsian government's deployed the Navy to clamp down on trouble spots, but the unrest is escalating all around Sulsian space. They're spread thin trying to cover everywhere at once."

6948, "We're going to be spoilt for choice with security contracts, but if the situation gets too messy I'm bailing us out of Sulsia."

6949, "I'll never choose a job that forces us to do terrible things to innocent people. However anyone who doesn't feel like they can continue here is free to leave."

6950, "Everyone on this ship is a volunteer, and I'll support whatever decision you make."

6951, "I got us a new contract. We're on security duty again."

6952, "We're headed to Korra Station, a silicon refinery in orbit of Rubedo."

6953, "Twelve hours ago the refinery workers staged a coup and stormed the station's CnC."

6954, "Thankfully no one was killed, but the facility is now in lockdown and all silicon refining has halted."

6955, "The workers have pledged solidarity to the Malika People's Militia, but the group hasn't claimed responsibility."

6956, "The mining corporation Energence Industries has contracted a troop transport to assault and take back the station. Our job is to provide escort and eliminate all threats."

6957, "Two missile corvettes have taken up sentry positions near the station."

6958, "They're essentially converted transports and shouldn't pose much of a threat to the Hoshikuzu. However they'll need to be dealt with before the marines can start their assault."

6959, "Before the assault can commence the station reactor needs to be disabled. This will cut power to the station and shut off the gravity generator."

6960, "This is the plan. The Hoshikuzu and transport Pollux Arrow will jump in outside of missile range to the corvettes and hang back."

6961, "We've attached an EMP mine to your gunship. You'll need to drop it off in proximity to the station's reactor. This means running a gauntlet of the missile corvettes to the station."

6962, "Once in position, detach the mine and move out of the area. The mine has a thirty second timer before sending out a powerful pulse to disable the station's reactor."

6963, "Once the reactor is down, the Pollux Arrow will begin her assault and breach the station."

6964, "Our job is to provide area cover during this phase of the operation."

6965, "I've checked with the Pollux Arrow and Energence Industries. This is to be a humane operation."

6966, "Energence Industries know that if things go badly here, it'll hit their bottom line. They're in full PR mode over this mess, and want this done clean."

; m14_vn.txt

6967, "I've got big news from the local feeds. The Motina Kometa crew just swore allegiance to Gadaria's Militia. They were the second largest Fringe group after the Malikans, and Gadaria's only remaining serious challengers."

6968, "The Malikans now have almost uncontested ownership of deep Fringe space, and enough military hardware to challenge the Sulsian Navy."

6969, "This is bad news. The only reason the Fringe groups hadn't overrun the Sulsian Navy before now is that they were competing with each other and disorganised enough to be suppressed piecemeal."

6970, "With the Fringe groups organised under one leader, the Sulsian government has upgraded the threat level to Severe. I'll keep a close eye out for more updates over the next few days."

6971, "Ross, we've finally invested in some new equipment for you and Meiks. Lau has to be the most miserly entrepeneur I've ever met."

6972, "You've got the option of Maxim cannons now. They're Federation-standard, firing solid flechettes instead of the Huaqing's explosive-tipped rounds."

6973, "This decreases the damage potential, but the rounds are faster and more accurate. Federation philosophy appears to be 'get enough ordnance on target, and the rest will sort itself out.'"

6974, "Like the Huaqings the Maxim pods are modular so it's a quick job to swap them out. Just let me know ahead of time."

6975, "Personally I don't care for them as much as the Huaqings but Lau says I'm just biased towards Combine equipment. They're there if you want them."

6976, "Ross, Meiks. This is probably a bad idea but we're doing it anyway. We've picked up a distress call from the Sulsian warship Protogeneia."

6977, "It looks like the Malikan militia's pulled off something big. They've ambushed the flagship of the Sulsian Navy, hit her reactor and left her adrift."

6978, "The Malikan warship Opus is bombarding the Protogeneia from range. Her capabilities are unknown, but she's bigger than the corvettes we've come up against previously."

6979, "The Hoshikuzu is the closest ship that can help. I'm bringing her in."

6980, "We're going in without much info but here's the best plan I've got."

6981, "Undock from the Hoshikuzu and move to defend the Protogeneia from incoming missiles. The Hoshikuzu will move to take up a defensive position alongside the battlecruiser."

6982, "We're going to try and buy time for the battlecruiser to restore power to her systems. The Opus is a lot bigger than we are and I don't plan to go near that ship."

6983, "The Protogeneia is a pre-Great War relic, but she's all brute and muscle. We just need to cover her while she restores power to her engines and weapons for a counter-attack."

6984, "I've been in contact with Latona waystation. Multiple Sulsian Navy ships are scrambling to assist, but none of them will arrive in time. We're likely be by ourselves during this engagement."

6985, "Everyone good? Ok. Let's go save some Sulsians."

; m15_vn.txt

6986, "LAU"

6987, "Okay. I've had my ear to the ground listening to newsfeeds and contacts in the merchant guilds. The general gist is that short of military convoys, commerce in Sulsian space is no longer feasible."

6988, "One in four transports aren't making it to their destinations. The Albans have withdrawn all of their convoy escorts for fleet duty. Same with the Jacobins, and the Rhenish."

6989, "The Sulsians are running out of ships. They don't have enough to cover the trade lanes and fight the Malikans at the same time."

6990, "I know it feels like we're abandoning Sulsia, but we're not equipped to fight a war. We'll have to come back when things settle down."

6991, "The Vicare system is looking like our best bet. It's the only supply hub in the region, so it's going to be a magnet for anyone fleeing the war zone."

6992, "Vicare is a border system, and it's the last port of call out of Sulsian space. Refugee and freight convoys have been gathering there over the past few days."

6993, "There'll be a chance to pick up a few escort jobs, and it's far enough away from the Malikan front that it's stable for now."

6994, "Something just came up. Ross has requested we divert to Kotus Anchorage, a Sulsian industrial hub. A large Malikan strike force is enroute and there's some civilians that need help."

6995, "Kotus is the site of an Alban Commonwealth embassy. The facility is evacuating its entire staff, and the transports need escorting out of the area."

6996, "They've sent out a call for assistance to secure the evacuation against a likely Malikan attack."

6997, "The evacuation is being hampered by heavy crowds. Thousands of people at the Anchorage are trying to get out of the system."

6998, "The transports are short-ranged and don't have intersystem hyperspace impellers. The Alban Commonwealth has dispatched the heavy transport Elgin to a rendezvous point in the system."

6999, "Other evacuations are taking place elsewhere in the system. The Elgin will be taking on passengers from these operations as well."

7000, "I know we've already made the decision to leave, so I wanted to run it past everyone first. Do we leave Sulsia now or do we help these Alban civilians first?"

7001, "All right. I guess that's decided. I'll let Kotus know we're on the way."

7002, "Oh, and Ross? Kaur's dug up some Vulcan medium cannons for you two to try out. I don't think we'll see any heavy bombers but they may be useful against Malikan raiders. Let him know if you want them loaded."

7023, "Enough. We're getting nowhere. I've tried to reason with you, make things right, but you're not listening."

7024, "I want both of us to heal and move past this, but it seems you're not ready for that."

7025, "I'm not ready. And I may never be ready. So just leave me alone, Katherine. I don't want your help...or your pity."

7026, "Okay. I'll leave you alone for now. But understand if you ever come after me again, I won't hesitate to protect myself. And I won't hold back next time."

7027, "Ross, listen. I've got some big news. Master Badami of the logistics ship Hopewell has contacted me with an intriguing proposition."

7028, "The Hopewell is undergoing conversion into a light carrier. Vicare yards say she'll be ready for flight operations in just under a week."

7029, "Badami asked me to train his crew in strikecraft maintenance. In return he's loaning us two Warden fighters from the Hopewell's strikecraft complement. Yeah, I told you it was big."

7030, "If you're not familiar with Wardens, they are decent heavy fighters. The Sulsians make good use of them in their navy. They're cannons only, but can move better than your missile gunships."

7031, "Like the Comet gunships, I've modified them to accept modular primary cannon banks. You'll be able to fit one bank of light kinetics and one bank of medium cannons."

7032, "The only issue is the guns tend to overheat quickly. The frame wasn't really designed for heavy cannons. However, the platform's got a versatility you won't find outside of current-gen strikecraft."

7033, "I've kept them in storage in the Vicare Station hangars alongside your gunships. We should be able to bring them along to the Hoshi's next sortie."

7034, "As usual, let me know ahead of time so I can make them ready."

7035, "If you need to find me, I'll be on the Hopewell running deck training. See you soon."

7036, "Looks like our reputation precedes us. I've been approached by Reverend Lightowler of the survey vessel Pillar of Fire. He's been running the Children of Renewal operations here at Vicare."

7037, "Lightowler wants an escort for a mission out near the edge of the Pallavian Veil. If you're not familiar with the Veil, the closest border is at least twenty light years from here."

7038, "So it's definitely not a small journey, but we've got the time. The Hoshikuzu is fully repaired but the Vicare yards report Nassau will still need at least a week."

7039, "I'm not sure if you've ever been there. It's a huge multisystem nebula around a star cluster. The radiation and gravity makes it a volatile area of space."

7040, "It's a long way away from colonised space and far out of the way of major transit lanes. I'm not expecting any trouble, but I wouldn't want to sail through the Veil without a good astrogation suite."

7041, "I haven't seen any ship like the Pillar of Fire before. She looks...pretty unique. Her master assures me that her astro equipment is up to specification."

7042, "I don't know what Lightowler plans to do out in the Veil, but it seems like an easy enough job. The Renewal are planning to take the Sulsian refugees to the Covenant system in a few days to meet up with their congregation."

7043, "Lightowler wants the survey mission finished before they move out. He seemed to think this part was important."

7044, "I'll round up the rest of the Hoshi's crew. We sail in two hours."

7047, "Don't worry about the mess. When your adrenaline's burned out I'll come in and help clean up your quarters. Just like old times at Erskine."

7048, "Don't be too hard on yourself. You've got every reason to be off your trolley. Gadaria had us up against the ropes, and it was a damn well near thing. Don't care how you release all that pent up stress. We're still alive to feel it."

7049, "So lad. Is this why you kept in Akrotiri after your Fed rotation? Did something happen in Morik that sent you on another spiral? I'm just telling you I understand, but I'm going in a bit blind here."

7050, "Let's just write off the next couple days, give yourself the time to get sorted. Don't worry about Lau. I'll come up with a good tale."

7051, "Hey guys, I've got some huge news."

7052, "It's official. Navo, Master Badami and I have joined forces. The Hoshikuzu, Pollux Arrow, Nassau and Hopewell now fly together as a team."

7053, "Considering we've previously worked closely with Navo and his marines, as well as Kaur working with the Hopewell's deck crew, this is probably all just a natural evolution of our relationship."

7054, "As part of the merge, Badami and Navo have agreed to give us access to their finances."

7055, "I've used a portion of our funds to refurbish the Hoshikuzu. The work will be done at Vicare station. With the Hopewell also being converted to a carrier, our group will be using almost all of Vicare's total yard capacity."

7056, "The Hoshi's going to be a whole new ship at the end of the refurbishment. Her drone bay and fighter maintenance facilities are being replaced with an ASM launcher."

7057, "This is a massive investment which I hope will pay off in the end. She's finally getting some teeth to match her lion's heart."

7058, "This means Ross and Meiks are moving out. The gunships will be transferred to the Hopewell's fighterbay along with both pilots. I'm sure you'll all be sad to see them go."

7059, "However, both Meiks and Ross will remain under my employment as part of the Hoshi's official roster. I'm not letting you two get away that easily."

7060, "Got a surprise for you Ross. I had some leftover funds after the Hoshi's refurbishment so I went shopping at Vicare."

7061, "The Hopewell is the proud home of two Tor-class bombers that I got for a bargain, along with a supply of Stiletto anti-ship bombs. They'll make up the Hopewell's heavy strike wing."

7062, "I want you to test out one of the bombers for me. We'll also use the opportunity to try out the Stilettos."

7063, "You, Meiks and I are taking a shuttle out to the Hopewell. From there we'll launch from the hangar and start the weapons test. I've got a test site set up in the nearby scrap field."

7064, "Obviously the Tor bomber is a lot heavier than your Comet gunship and even more sluggish. Today I want you to get a feel for how it flies in case you need to use it in the future."

7065, "This is like Christmas all over again! Ok Ross, let's grab Meiks and get to the Hopewell."

7070, "It's been a rough few days. One crisis after another, it's all getting too much. Feeling like I'm just hanging on by a thread."

7071, "I'm still not sure I did the right thing by Kendra. Maybe I should have tried harder to get through to her. All I wanted was to move on and make things better between us. Instead I've made things worse."

7072, "And if that wasn't enough, Gadaria ambushed us. God, I still get cold sweats at night thinking how close we came to losing it all. Just sheer dumb luck that got us out in the end."

7073, "Feels like one of these days I'll push Fate too hard, and her debtors'll come knocking."

7074, "Anyway, I've decided I'm going to fly with you and Meiks today. We're short on pilots. Erikson will look after the Hoshi while I'm out there."

7075, "We've got a good crew. If there's anyone that can get through these rough times, I suppose it'll be us. If we're still here it means we're doing something right."

7076, "Maybe we work so well because we're all so different. Everyone brings something new to the table. No weaknesses, no blind spots."

7077, "Maybe I should stop doing so much myself and let you all have a bit more autonomy. I'm just worried the Hoshikuzu's going to fall apart just because Katherine Lau decided to take a break."

7078, "Phew, sorry about that Ross. Must've been carrying a lot on my chest. I wasn't expecting any of this when I decided to go into merc work."

7079, "One thing at a time, in order of importance. We get this refugee convoy out. That's the number one priority."

7080, "Once the refugees are safe, we find the nearest Commonwealth port and give Kendra to the Albans. After that, I can finally sit down and work out where we go from there."

7081, "Do you think I'm being too optimistic, planning too far ahead? The future seems so muddy with all the things going on right now."

7082, "But I suppose I've got to. That's how we survive. Life goes on around us even when everything seems overwhelming."

7083, "Well, looks like work calls. The waystation sensor reports have arrived. Thanks for listening, Ross. I really needed it."

7084, "Looks like everyone's tuned in. Okay, let's start. Here's the situation."

7085, "Latona Waystation has reported Combine warships heading directly for Vicare station. They will arrive within the half-hour. We've run out of time."

7086, "The composition of the attacking force is hard to pin down, but the strength of their impeller signals suggest a battlecruiser task group at least."

7087, "Captain Oberthur has placed the Thanatos and her escorts at full combat alertness. The Atlantean Federation warships will occupy the Combine task force while the refugee transports clear Vicare station."

7088, "The Nassau and Hoshikuzu are not expected to fight the Combine ships, but are to stay with the convoy to screen against skirmishers."

7089, "I'm pretty damned glad. I don't fancy my chances against a Combine battlecruiser. Let the Federation fight the war, that's supposed to be what they do best right?"

7090, "While the Thanatos and her ships keep the Combine busy, the convoy will move to clear Vicare Station. Once at safe distance, the transports will jump out to rendezvous with the Renewal congregation."

7091, "For our pilots who haven't met Meiks and Ross, they're the two gunship pros from the Hoshikuzu. They'll be Alfa wing. Captain Lau is Bravo 1. Keep an ear out for her instructions and follow her target calls."

7092, "Everyone else will be distributed among Bravo and Charlie wings."

7093, "Okay. Captain Lau, Master Badami. Anything else to add? Good. Everyone has their role. Let's get out there and protect these refugees."

7098, "The loss of the Elgin was tragic. Even so, the Commonwealth embassy suffered minimal casualties."

7099, "This attack on Commonwealth citizens wasn't a random Malikan raid. I'm afraid I must take partial responsibility. I work for ANI."

7100, "I seem to have made some very well-resourced people upset, and unfortunately Commonwealth citizens were caught in the crossfire. When one can't find one's target, carpet bomb the ground around them and to hell with collateral damage."

7101, "I have information that could lead us to Andri Gadaria's mysterious benefactor. The Malikans are a pawn in a greater game. We're now starting to find out who the players are."

7102, "ANI will have need of your services soon. You can play at being mercenaries for a little while longer but don't drag your feet when Fleet calls. You still have your oath to His Majesty."

7104, "Welcome everyone."

7106, "For those who have never been to Covenant, you're in for a sight."

7107, "Covenant isn't a system or a planet. It's a hyperspace capable habitat that's a hub for transports, freighters and refinery ships all in service with the Children of Renewal."

7108, "I've been there before. The Children of Renewal are good people. The refugees will be well looked after."

7109, "Our job will be done once we arrive in Covenant. Once our payment comes through, I plan to find a Commonwealth port to drop off Kendra."

7110, "The Nassau, Hopewell and Pollux Arrow are free to pick up extra contracts at Covenant to pay for running costs."

7111, "Thanks Lau. We should be fine for a while. The bonus pay promised by Reverend Lightowler is substantial. Almost unexpectedly so."

7112, "Interesting. I get the feeling Lightowler's free with his credits because he doesn't see a need for them anymore."

7113, "The Children of Renewal must be planning something big."

7114, "Good luck to them. In the meantime, we've decided Ross, Meiks and Lau will run escort during the final approach. Our fighters got shot up pretty bad during the escape from Vicare and several of our pilots are recuperating."

7115, "Ambassador Hayburn assures me he will negotiate transport for the Alban citizens and Lightowler will represent the rest of the Sulsian refugees."

7116, "All we have to do is provide security for the approach and subsequent personnel transfer."

7132, "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings."

7133, "Artemis is a cruiser-carrier hybrid. She doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of the larger fleet carriers, but her heavy autocannons get the job done."

7141, "Task Force 55 is assisting the Elam Republic in their war against the Qahtadnan Union. Federation Defense Intelligence believes the Sinarus Combine has been providing military and logistical support to the other side."

7142, "President Fitzgerald wants our deployment to send a message. The Federation will not tolerate any Combine interference in our own backyard."

7143, "FNS Artemis's area of operations will be the Durius system, one of the Republic's mining hubs. Our task is to defend the system against Qahtadnan incursions. We can expect to take part in combat operations."

7144, "The Atlantean Federation has not declared hostilities against the Sinarus Combine. However any Combine forces identified in Durius are to be assumed hostile."

7145, "We arrive at Durius in seven days. All officers and crew are expected to be familiar with orientation material and emergency procedures before we arrive."

7146, "Good morning pilots. It's been a long journey but the Artemis has finally arrived at Durius. We've taken up station at Durius Installation, the commercial and industrial hub of the system."

7147, "This area's seen several engagements between encroaching Qahtadnan forces and the Elam navy garrison."

7148, "The local sensor system has been compromised. Our first priority is to reestablish this network. When this is done we can begin combat operations in the system."

7149, "Ahab and Ross, you'll be flying escort for the Sina, an Elam navy corvette."

7150, "Sensor platforms have been loaded onto the corvette for deployment. If hostile forces attempt to impede, you are authorised to engage and neutralise them."

7156, "Katherine Lau has already accepted the terms of our contract of employment. I thought it prudent you receive a personalised briefing. You're a King's Officer, even if you're still on half-pay leave."

7157, "First, a summary of the strategic situation and how it relates to our upcoming operation."

7158, "As you know, an unknown actor has been supplying the Malikans with high grade weapons, and setting them loose in Sulsia."

7159, "It's clear the intent was to cripple the Sulsian economy, and as a result undermine Commonwealth interests in the sector."

7160, "The identity of the supplier is unconfirmed, but we believe high ranking officers within the Sinarus Combine are involved."

7161, "The consequences have been severe. The Sulsian navy has been brought to its knees, and thousands of civilians in Sulsia have died at the hands of Andri Gadaria's militia."

7162, "ANI has also uncovered evidence of Gadaria organising the nuclear attack on Covenant."

7163, "For his crimes, the Crown Navy intends to help bring Gadaria to justice."

7164, "Crown High Command has identified two short-term goals in the Sulsian theatre. First is to apprehend or neutralise Gadaria."

7165, "Second is to identify the individual responsible for arming Gadaria's terrorist group and gather evidence against them."

7166, "We're building a coalition to challenge the Sinarus Combine. The more evidence we can bring to the table, the more support we can gather and the better we can offset the Combine's military power."

7167, "When war comes to the Commonwealth, we'll need all the advantage we can get."

7168, "All right Ross, Meiks. The Commonwealth Navy's hired us for an operation against the Sinarus Combine. Looks like we've already chosen a side in this war."

7169, "Commander Cameron's crew has finished their interrogation of Kendra. She doesn't know who her employer was but was able to give details of their intermediary."

7170, "Through Kendra's information, the Albans have identified a convoy which could give clues to her employer's identity."

7171, "The convoy contains three Sinarus-flagged freighters with a cruiser escort. Their destination is Guardador Station, a mining hub in Sulsia that was comandeered by the Malikans several days ago."

7172, "The cargo manifest on those freighters mentions heavy mining equipment but the Albans believe they're shipping weapons under cover."

7173, "The Albans want one of the freighters so they can dissect her cargo for clues. This is where we come in."

7174, "The Hoshikuzu will jump in just inside ASM range of the convoy and launch missile strikes against the convoy's escorts. The hope is that the Combine warships are lured into an engagement away from their charges."

7175, "Once an opening is made, you need to disable the astrogation systems of one of the freighters. This is critical. We cannot commit the rest of our group until we're sure the freighters won't be able to make a run for it."

7176, "Once this is done we'll call in the Nassau, Hopewell and the Aria to assault the Combine ships."

7177, "This is going to be a balancing act. As long as the Combine think they're dealing with a solitary corvette, they'll be less inclined to warp out."

7178, "One more thing you two should know. The Hoshi's drone bay got replaced by her ASM launcher, so you won't have any repair drones for the first part of the mission. Be careful out there."

7179, "I think that's it. Probably the most insane job I've ever accepted, but your Commander Cameron is paying us premium rates. It helps that I've got you two with me to help pull this through."

7180, "I got an urgent communication from Admiral Bertini's office. The old bulldog wants us flying alongside his flagship against the Malikans. He's got firm intel on Gadaria's location and he wants blood."

7181, "The terrorist leader has been tracked to Jotram Station, the logistical, military and spiritual heart of the Malika People's Militia. The place is a fortress, but Bertini wants us to crack it open."

7182, "The Sulsians didn't say why Gadaria withdrew back home after spending months in the front lines, though I'd bet good money the inbound Commonwealth battle group's got something to do with it."

7183, "It doesn't matter. The Sulsian navy has been crippled by months of Malikan hit and run attacks and most ships have been destroyed or are under repair. Admiral Bertini needs escort ships for the attack on Jotram Station."

7184, "Bertini's primary objective is to locate Andri Gadaria and bring him to justice."

7185, "Fringe law is relatively straightforward in this regard. Justice for the Sulsians means death, whether it's through a court-sentenced execution or missile warheads."

7186, "I've accepted his contract. I didn't even negotiate a higher payment. If Bertini wants to send Gadaria to hell, I'm one hundred percent on board."

7187, "Jotram Station is the hub of asteroid mining operations in the system. It was the site of the first worker rebellion that birthed the Malika People's Militia."

7188, "Bertini plans for it to be the site where the Militia dies."

7189, "Sulsian intelligence on the station is comprehensive. Jotram is heavily guarded by the cruisers Yama and Virago, and a screen of smaller corvettes."

7190, "The Protogeneia is the sole remaining heavy unit of the Sulsian Navy and will be the backbone of the assault. The Hoshikuzu and Nassau is to provide CIWS support against Malikan gunships and ASMs."

7191, "Bertini assures me the Protogeneia can eat the smaller Malikan ships for breakfast. What the battlecruiser can't do is counter small strike craft and missiles. We'll just have to do that for her."

7192, "Last time the Hoshikuzu faced off against Gadaria's ships, she was a converted transport with only a few light cannons as armament. This time she's a fully armed warship, and she's got friends."

7193, "It's time to buckle up. Today the Hoshi and Nassau go to war."

; m22_vn.txt

7194, "Lieutenant. My congratulations on your victory at Jotram Station. The entire operation was a risk but Bertini was never a man of temperance."

7195, "The strategic balance in Sulsia is shifting. I've been informed the Children of Renewal congregation is heading for the Pallavian Veil."

7196, "We believe this is one reason why the Malikans have halted their advance and pulled back. We're unsure how the Children of Renewal prompted this, as they have no military capacity to threaten Gadaria."

7197, "Admiral Cleghorn has authorised a light unit detachment to shadow the Renewal congregation. Due to the proximity of the Veil to Sulsia, we need to identify any possible threats to future Commonwealth operations here."

7198, "I want your ships with me when we escort the Renewal convoy to it's destination, and find out their intentions there."

7199, "Your Katherine Lau already has a professional relationship with Reverend Lightowler on Covenant, and I plan to take full advantage of this."

7200, "I've contacted Reverend Lightowler. He's given us the coordinates of the Children of Renewal's final destination. It's deep within the Pallavian Veil, off of all major cartographical charts."

7201, "This is the location of their 'Promised Land'. They're making the final journey with the entire contingent."

7202, "I've checked our long range sensors. There's a black hole orbiting a K-type star, but no detectable planets or other system bodies. Lightowler assures me the coordinates correspond to high orbit of an Earth-like planet."

7203, "It's possible the black hole or the Veil itself is confounding our long range sensors. If there is a planet out there, we might not be able to see it."

7204, "The Children of Renewal have shared their space charts with us. If we need to make our way out without Covenant, we'll be able to use their navigation data."

7205, "I suspect this is the last job that the Renewal are offering us. Lightowler's offering an astronomical payment for this job, enough for me, Navo and Badami to retire comfortably and the rest of our group to receive a generous payout."

7206, "I don't know if this 'Promised Land' is real. I suppose it doesn't matter. It's real enough to the Children of Renewal and that's good enough for my conscience."

7210, "It didn't turn out so bad I suppose. Managed to do some good out here. Showed the Combine a thing or two about messin with the Commonwealth didn't we?"

7211, "Anyway, I think this is the end for me lad. My fighting days are done. The cocktail hangovers are getting rougher and lasting longer. They say your body lets you know when it's had enough and mine's shouting at me pretty damn loud."

7230, "We now know the ghost station you encountered was a Combine research base to study the alien technology. This explains how they were able to develop their own version of Solaris so quickly."

7231, "Crown HIGHCOM's overarching objective is to stop the Combine's Solaris weapon. Securing the Veil station is crucial to this. Neutralising the Combine forces in Sulsia is a preliminary objective."

7232, "Your first posting will be aboard HMS Aria as her attending pilot. Aria is being redeployed for a special assignment. I'll let Commander Cameron brief you on the specifics."

7233, "Hello LC Ross. Welcome to HMS Aria. I hope my XO's already brought you up to speed on ship orientation. We've got a lot of work ahead of us."

7234, "Fifth Expeditionary is going to war, and Aria is paving the way. Our first mission is the neutralisation of one of Kakotchka's trump cards."

7235, "Rear Admiral Kakotchka's Zaragoza battle group is a potent formation employing a number of force multipliers."

7236, "The Zaragoza herself is a powerful command ship with state of the art command and control facilities. Her veteran crew are well-trained and Kakotchka has a reputation as an astute strategist."

7237, "The new Torrent-class arsenal cruisers are the iron fist of Kakotchka's armada. You've seen firsthand what these ships can do. At this time we have no way to counter their missile salvoes."

7238, "The Suppressor-class gravity ship is the anvil to the Torrents' hammer. Kakotchka is still running operational evaluations of the technology. We believe there are no more than two of these ships in Sulsia at this time."

7239, "Cleghorn can't commit his heavy ships against Kakotchka without risking an ambush from the arsenal cruisers. Hence, our mission."

7240, "CS Thresher is currently docked at Vicare Station undergoing minor repairs and resupply. Though the Combine garrison at Vicare is substantial, the cruiser is most vulnerable to attack during this period."

7241, "This is a covert operation to get our forces in range to Vicare station unopposed. The lynchpin of this attack is the minelayer Nashira, a modified Carthage freighter. The Malikans have employed similar warships in the past."

7242, "Playing the part of a Malikan supply convoy, you and Nashira are to move into position close to Thresher. To complete the deception, you'll be flying a repurposed Mace fighter for this mission."

7243, "This operation hinges on redistributing the Vicare garrison prior to moving against our primary target. A distraction force will simulate a navigation transponder error by arriving at range to the station."

7244, "The aim is to force the Combine garrison into committing security assets to cover multiple angles of approach. The navigation error will also provide a credible explanation for Nashira's approach."

7245, "Once in position, Nashira will launch a combined EMP and HE attack to cripple the cruiser. Even if not outright destroyed, this will neutralise Thresher for a significant period."

7246, "This operation is the culmination of weeks of planning. The viability of future Commonwealth operations in Sulsia rests on a successful outcome."

7257, "I wouldn't say that. I like to think I'm doing rather well."

7259, "Worthwhile, no. Important, yes. I need to talk to you about ANI."

7260, "Oh? Don't tell me His Majesty's getting cold feet."

7261, "It's not King Edward, it's Parliament. The Prime Minister objected to some of ANI's actions in the field. Your creative use of NEMP against Combine warships for one."

7262, "Evans is the political equivalent of a plecostomus. Someone needs to tell him that Solaris represents an existential threat."

7263, "Prime Minister Evans is worried about a potential backlash once the public discovers that Navy vessels broke the Miranda Accord. 'We'll be giving the Combine a justification for declaring war on us, weakening our position!'"

7264, "He's threatening to defund the Advanced Threat Identification program. The same program that allowed ANI to track Solaris in the first place."

7265, "All I'm hearing is a lot of hot air. If Evans wants to go up against King Edward, he's welcome to try. The man knows ATI is His Majesty's pet project."

7266, "There's no doubt it'll survive. Short-term budget cuts will hurt you though. I'd like Naval Intelligence to tread carefully for the next few weeks. We're in uncharted waters."

7272, "It's been a while since Aria's had a seconded fighter pilot. We appreciate it every time. Aria's combat ability goes up by an order of magnitude, and the crew enjoys seeing a new face."

7273, "Coming to a new environment is always a challenge, more so if there's no one else like you around. 'The navy pilot career burns bright and short,' and you're a beacon shining bright in the sterile monotony of ship duty."

7274, "Being Aria's pilot doesn't have to be lonely. Get to know the crew. Ensign Holmes on tactical is dying to ask you questions. Share piloting experiences with helmsman Ryan. Show them the type of person you are, and let them do the same for you."

7275, "Aria's crew will depend on you to keep them safe in combat. I think it'll be good for them and for yourself if you're not an island in here."

7276, "Orders from Royal Oak. Aria is being deployed."

7277, "With the support of Cleghorn's battlegroup, the Sulsians have been retaking Malikan-occupied territory. Bertini's now got his sights set on several critical resource hubs and is planning a major offensive to hit them simultaneously."

7278, "Aria and Camperton of 2nd Light Squadron will be supporting the Sulsian cruiser Prennia at the Guardador Station mining hub."

7279, "If the name sounds familiar, this is where we hit the Combine weapons convoy weeks ago with Katherine Lau's flotilla. For several weeks now the station has been funnelling raw materials to Gadaria's war machine."

7280, "If Bertini has his way, the station will soon be supplying the Sulsian war machine instead."

7281, "The Malikans have fortified Guardador since the convoy attack. A perimeter of ASM launchers have been deployed around the station. Any large-scale attack will be vulnerable to these missile platforms."

7282, "Those platforms must be cleared out before the Sulsians can begin their assault against the station. This will be your primary objective for the sortie."

7283, "Once cleared, our ships can close the distance to the station and provide artillery support for the marine transports."

7284, "This is one of the first joint operations between Sulsian and Commonwealth forces. Sulsian training and experience can be found lacking compared to that of the Crown Navy, but their earnestness can't be faulted."

7285, "The Commonwealth Crown Navy is a standard against which all other navies are measured. Whatever happens out there I expect full professionalism from you as befitting a King's Officer, Lieutenant Commander Ross."

7286, "Captain Tierney has authorised the use of a strike-capable craft for this sortie. You'll have the choice between the Lightning Interceptor and the Raptor Defender. "

7287, "If you're not familiar with either craft, I suggest you study their technical schematics before choosing your loadout. In brief, the Lightning is a high performance hit-and-run interceptor, but the slower Raptor has an extra railgun bank and increased armour."

7288, "You'll also get support from Camperton's UAVs to cover your approach. You're best deploying them against enemy fighters and gunships."

7289, "We launch in sixty minutes. You have that much time to prepare. Dismissed, LC."

7296, "Commander Riza's got the bridge. I've got time."

7297, "I've just got off comms with Admiral Bertini. He's pleased with the Guardador op but wants to maintain 'strategic momentum', in his words."

7298, "He's building up a force to assault Vicare Station. Says he needs the shipyards to maintain his fleet strength."

7299, "Straight to Vicare? Can't fault him for lack of ambition. Has he got the forces to make a serious job of it?"

7300, "Maybe. I'm not sure if Kakotchka would commit to a serious defense if there's a risk of high losses. Vicare Station's useful but not crucial. He may have a chance."

7301, "It's not like Kakotchka to give Vicare up so cheaply. It's her only major base in Sulsia."

7302, "The Archon doesn't care about bases. He wants the artifact back under Combine control. Everything else is a smoke screen."

7303, "Speaking of which. Are you planning to help Bertini at Vicare?"

7304, "I'm considering sending a small detachment to support the attack. If Bertini takes Vicare, he'll be less dependent on our support for the rest of the Malikan war. It's a decent enough investment."

7305, "That'll be the best outcome. The Sulsians resent us being here, but expect us to follow them lockstep in all things."

7306, "I know we're allies and the future of Sulsia hinges on this, but really? If you want my opinion, the galaxy'll be better off without the Hegemony."

7307, "The Sulsians can be occasionally useful. Bertini plans to attack once his forces are ready, maybe a week or so. I need your input. What can we deploy in that time?"

7308, "Hmm...we'll have to reprioritise our resupply schedule, release some of the light escort units. Have the Ladigue workers run double shifts. Might work."

7309, "We could have a force mission-ready within a week. I'll have my staff run some estimates and get back to you later."

7310, "Thank you Deckard, that would be splendid. We only need to send a few light units with a cruiser anchor. I'll also ask Admiral Aguillard to contribute some Republique ships."

7311, "Should keep the old bulldog happy. In the meantime, should we continue preparations for the Veil op?"

7312, "Yes. Tell me Deckard, is Stuart Ross still at Aria? Do you plan to rotate him to Royal Oak's squadrons?"

7313, "The LC is doing well enough at Aria for now. He's a competent enough pilot, but it sounds like he's been stung by ANI before. I'm keeping his clearance as-is."

7314, "Agreed. In any event he's most useful at Aria under Cameron's observation. I want him close at hand and accessible at all times. He's going to be of more use with ANI than with Fleet Air."

7315, "And Deckard? Keep trying to pin down the location of those high value targets we discussed. I plan to meet Kakotchka with every advantage we can muster."

7316, "Lieutenant Commander. Tierney's beamed over our mission orders."

7317, "The Sulsians have requested a recon element scout out an asteroid cluster in the Multnomah system. The system is currently contested between Malikan and Sulsian forces."

7318, "There's been unusually high ship activity in the area. Bertini wants to see if the Malikans have established a resource hub or fleet staging infrastructure that his forces could comandeer."

7319, "Like her sisters in the Arrowhead class, HMS Aria has an advanced sensor suite that makes her suited to reconnaissance missions like these."

7320, "The cluster is a dense field of chondrite rocks and thick dust. Even with Aria's specialised recon systems, sensor strength will be compromised. Your fighter will act as a mobile sensor relay as you scout out the field."

7321, "The Jacobine corvette Glaive will accompany us to provide sensor support. Her attending fighter will support you on this mission."

7322, "HMS Assurance is currently stationed in Multnomah as part of the Sulsian security detail. If you run into a significant enemy presence, the cruiser will be deployed to assist."

7401, "Reconnaisance reports from ANI confirms Combine, Malikan and Shogunate forces have concentrated their remaining strike units in the Pallavian Veil, including the deployment of several specialised demolition assets."

7402, "Admiral Kakotchka most likely intends to destroy the gateway outright if she's unable to keep control. Our objective is to deny her that option."

7403, "HMS Aria will conduct a precision clearance operation, using her sensors and ECM suite to clear a series of nuclear-patterned mines seeded around the gateway. We believe the Combine intend to detonate these mines as a final denial measure."

7404, "This will be a tight operation under close proximity to the gateway structure itself. The gateway's energy output masks any power readings from the mines, so Aria will have to close in to detect and remotely deactivate them."

7405, "Once the threat of gateway destruction is eliminated, Formidable and her escorts will jump in for the next phase of the operation."

7406, "All outside approaches to the Veil-1 site are guarded by an extensive minefield and heavy ASM sentries. Corvettes Aria and Glaive under a UAV screen will dismantle the minefield while eliminating the ASM batteries."

7407, "Once cleared, Formidable and her ships will begin the assault."

7408, "Commander Ross. If Kakotchka deploys her arsenal cruisers against Formidable, I want Aria in position and ready to launch countermeasures against the Burya missile swarms. Situational awareness will be critical in this phase."

7409, "HMS Royal Oak will be kept in reserve once we have a better idea of how Kakotchka plans to deploy her heavy assets. The carrier and her strike wings will be used to counter any flanking manoeuvres against Formidable."

7410, "Katherine Lau and her corvette Hoshikuzu will be taking part in a separate action planetside, attempting to get in contact with Reverend Lightowler of the Children of Renewal."

7411, "We believe bringing Lightowler to our cause will shift the balance of power further in our favour."

7442, "You let yourself get into a turning fight against enemy fighters, you're not coming back alive. Never engage the enemy in a Hornet without support, you hear me?"

7443, "Sorry. High-G cocktail just kicked in. I'll see you at the briefing."

7444, "All right pilots. We're going on the offensive."

7445, "At 1255 hours, the Euphrates arrived in Durius. The destroyer will support the Artemis as part of a carrier strike group. Two Elam Navy corvettes have also been placed under joint command for this operation."

7446, "Our scouts have identified the Qahtadnan battle carrier Gharial, command ship of the Durius invasion force."

7447, "The Gharial is accompanied by a pair of support carriers, a wing of gunboats and light attack craft."

7448, "They've taken up station deep in the asteroid field, and we expect them to move against Durius Installation soon."

7449, "Admiral Akrami has authorised the initiation of Operation Chromite. Our mission - the elimination of the Qahtadnan battlegroup in Durius."

7450, "The strike group will consist of the Artemis, Euphrates and the Elam Navy corvettes all flying in close support. Our ships will punch through the Qahtadnan light units screening the Gharial before engaging the carrier herself."

7451, "The Gharial is armed with heavy anti-ship cruise missiles capable of doing significant damage to our ships. I expect you to maintain good area defense to nullify the anti-ship threat."

7452, "Ahab, Ross and Preacher will make up Alpha wing flying Hornet strikers. Raptor, Punchy and Hoser are in Viper fighters as Beta wing."

7453, "This operation, if successful, will secure Durius for the Elam Republic and cripple a large portion of the Qahtadnan navy."

7454, "The Artemis was built for fights like these. Let's show these Qahtadnans the door."

7456, "Major engagements in Durius and Akkad saw attacking Qahtadnan Union forces defeated by the Republic-Federation coalition."

7457, "In Akkad, the Qahtadnan flagship 'Al-Gazi' was destroyed along with several major warships."

7458, "Atlantean President Fitzgerald is expected to release a press statement later today outlining future military action in the Elam-Qahtadnan war."

7459, "A declaration of victory is widely expected to be in the statement."

7460, "In response, Combine warships have garrisoned the systems of Alphard and Actium as part of a massive military build up along the border of Combine and Federation space."

7461, "Archon Sarshar defended the action in a press announcement today."

7462, "Sarshar"

7463, "I will not sit by while the Atlantean Federation continues to threaten our systems."

7464, "This is a proportionate response to the Federation's flagrant disregard for international order."

7465, "The Sinarussian people would expect no less from their leader."

7466, "Analysts suggest Archon Sarshar intends to discard the terms of the Miranda Accord, with Sinarussian state officials openly proposing 'returning the borders to pre-Great War levels'."

7467, "CBN ANALYSIS"

7468, "This would place a significant portion of Federation territory back under Combine rule."

7469, "Alban Prime Minister Charles Evans warned that time was running out for a diplomatic solution to the crisis."

7470, "Evans"

7471, "No one wins in a war between the Federation and Combine. No nation - large or small - will escape its monstrous reach. It's in all our interests to promote a peaceful solution, whatever the cost."

7472, "There are some alive today who remember first-hand the horrors of the Great War. Only forty years ago, and yet we risk the same devastation if we stay this course. We'll have learned nothing."

7473, "CAPT MARIS RAMLY - FNS ARTEMIS, DURIUS SYSTEM"

7474, "All right. Back to business. It looks like the Sinarus Combine isn't done with us yet."

7475, "New orders have come from Command. The Artemis is being deployed to the Mira neutron star, located at the fringes of Elam space."

7476, "Intelligence data reports that the Combine have established a base in the system in violation of Republic sovereign territory."

7477, "Our mission is to confirm the presence of the base, secure the area and board the station to find out what the Sinarus Combine was planning in the system."

7478, "Command has given us no further intelligence on Combine motives, and I'm not going to speculate on what they're planning. Let's just say whatever it is won't be good for us or for the Elamites."

7479, "Now, you should know that we will likely be firing the first shots in a new conflict with the Combine."

7480, "I know you're all ready for this. We're part of the greatest military might this galaxy has ever seen and second to none. The bastards brought this on themselves."

7481, "If we do this right, we'll smash the Combine fleet and show the Combine they started a fight that they can't win."

7482, "Welcome to Mira. No inhabitable planets, scant resources, and no reason for anyone to stay longer than necessary."

7483, "Your guess is as good as mine why the Combine have set up shop here. We'll just have to find out ourselves."

7484, "We've confirmed the location of a Combine base and will proceed to secure the station."

7485, "Fifth Fleet Command has deployed the marine transport Sycorax to join us in Mira."

7486, "Recon intel puts the Combine aviation cruiser Semper Victoria on station at the base."

7487, "The firepower of the Artemis and her strike wings should be enough to resolve an engagement in our favour."

7488, "Integral to this will be the neutralisation of the Semper Victoria's Javelin ASM battery and air wing."

7489, "Once the area is secure, the Sycorax will perform a boarding action against the station."

7490, " Your job will be to cover the boarding operation against further Combine attack."

7491, "Razor, you're with Ahab on Alpha. Congratulations on the callsign. Raptor and Cook are Beta. Punchy and Soap will make up Gamma."

7494, "A Combine battlegroup led by the carrier Excelsior has attacked Elam and Federation positions throughout Elam space. Task Force 55 has exchanged weapons fire with Combine warships. These are the first confrontations of a cold war gone hot."

7495, "We've taken casualties but we've given just as good as we got. The Excelsior is sweeping through Elam space with her sights set on the Durius system."

7496, "I'm deploying the Colossus to intercept the carrier at Durius. If Durius falls, the capital Akkad is going to be the Combine's next target."

7497, "The Combine have finally shown their hand. Now it's time to finish this game."

7498, "This is it. The Combine have thrown down the gauntlet and invaded Durius as part of a coordinated multi-system action. Here's the situation."

7499, "Enemy disposition: The Combine command ship Excelsior is fifteen klicks out and approaching at flank speed. She's launched a wing of Ka-15 'Defender' fighters, but we expect further strike launches are on the way."

7500, "Artemis and Euphrates are maintaining static defensive positions alongside Durius Installation. Squadron wings are to take up security positions around the warships and provide an area screen."

7501, "The Excelsior carries a stockpile of the Combine strategic nuclear arsenal. We can expect the use of these weapons. Target her Eos missiles as a priority."

7502, "The carrier's heavy bombers also present a nuclear threat. Keep your eyes open for bomber deployment and prosecute these HVTs as necessary."

7503, "Admiral Akrami's dreadnought Colossus has been diverted from Akkad to provide support. We need to hold our ground long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

7504, "However, waystation sensors report additional Combine attack ships converging on our position."

7505, "It is likely these reinforcements will arrive before the Colossus."

7506, "We'll be outnumbered and outgunned for most of this battle, but Durius Installation does not fall, understand? The fort must hold."

7507, "Everyone that's fit to fly goes out today. We're about to hit a storm and need all hands on deck."

7514, "30 minutes ago, long range sensors detected a significant cosmological event in the Morik system."

7515, "A massive energy burst was detected, powerful enough to cause shockwaves through hyperspace."

7516, "My analysts believe this is the cause of the comms blackout."

7517, "A disaster of unprecedented scale appears to have happened at Morik. I am authorising a reconnaissance mission to the system."

7518, "Morik is a critical military and industrial hub, and was home to the bulk of Fifth Fleet."

7524, "Despite these setbacks, I know we're still more than capable of performing this mission."

7525, "Deck crews will notice the new complement of Thunderbolt interceptors."

7526, "Our mission parameters have changed. With the escalating conflict, we are progressing into an ASM-heavy combat environment."

7531, "I got a report from forensics after they dug through my bird - looks like a Combine shell tore through the air filter and gave me a dose of waste emissions before the safeties kicked in."

7532, "Anyway, I may grumble but I'm counting my lucky stars I'm still here. Doing better than a lot of other people."

7537, "We haven't really talked much but you seem like a good guy. You're an Alban like Raptor so you get bonus points."

7538, "Take care of Raptor while I'm gone, okay? You let anything happen to her, I'll come find you and kick your ass."

7539, "Ok Razor. I'll see you round."

7541, "We have arrived in the midst of a debris field."

7542, "Positioning reads correct. We should be in the vicinity of Fifth Fleet headquarters. Instead there's rubble."

7544, "Nothing's left on the surface but molten rock."

7545, "Our sensors are reading massive gravitational shifts within a relatively localised area in space."

7546, "Shear forces are causing extreme tectonic shifting on the planet's crust."

7547, "This appears to be the result of a massive, temporary gravity well in close proximity to the planet."

7548, "We have no idea what caused this, nor whether this is some sort of new Combine weapon."

7549, "We can confirm that this is a disaster of unprecedented scale, but the mission must go on."

7558, "There's much to do and little time to do it. Here's the situation."

7559, "Ten days ago a major engagement took place at Bulwark which resulted in the destruction of Fifth Fleet, and the devastation of Bulwark's surface. We call this the 'cataclysm'."

7560, "I don't know how, but the Combine kicked us in the ass so hard that we're still feeling it days later. All reports suggest it was some sort of superweapon of immense power."

7561, "It was a god damn massacre, and Combine forces moved in straight after. Intel is sparse, but we know Admiral Lucja Romanowska and her command ship Imperatrix leads the Combine occupation."

7562, "Anyway, there's hyperspace interference all through the system, making intersystem communications impossible. I've deployed couriers out to Shen Kuo, Akkad and Lincoln to establish contact with other Federation task groups. No reply as yet."

7563, "Once help arrives, we can assault Romanowska and her superweapon and take back Morik from the Combine."

7564, "That all comes later. Right now I have a mission for you. Briefing is at 1330hrs."

7565, "Lieutenant Ross. Lieutenant McKearney. It's your time to shine."

7566, "I'm sending you to Juliet Base, the command centre for Federation Defense Intelligence on Bulwark. It's got something we need. Recon sweeps suggest that Juliet Base survived the cataclysm abandoned but intact."

7567, "A few weeks ago, your Artemis assaulted a Combine station in Mira, and a data cache was retrieved. That data is now in Juliet Base. We believe the Mira data contains crucial information related to the cataclysm weapon."

7568, "Juliet just so happens to be a major storage depot for Fifth Fleet. A depot with supplies we desperately need."

7569, "You'll be accompanying the transport Rocinante. She's been modified to carry interceptors and will serve as your launch point once she is on location."

7570, "I'm sending the Uriel and Phoenix along. They'll be shuttling personnel to reactivate Juliet Base's automated systems."

7571, "Once on location, launch and sweep Juliet Base for hostiles. When the base is clear, the shuttles will dock."

7572, "Shuttle Uriel's mission is to restore power to the base energy grid. Once the Command centre is powered and online the Rocinante can spike the data network."

7573, "Shuttle Phoenix loaded with the rest of Longview's pilots will dock with the base hangars and identify any flight-ready craft to reinforce your air patrol."

7574, "Securing the Combine research data is the primary objective. Once that's done and the area is secure of hostiles, the rest of the flotilla can begin procurement of the supplies."

7575, "Not to put too much pressure on you two, but this is our one and only chance to make this work. Good luck out there."

7576, "Ross, McKearney. Lieutenant Wade Murphy. CAG of what passes for the Longview's fighter wing."

7577, "Lancaster will probably have my head over this, but you should know what you're getting into. Things are bad."

7578, "Most of our pilot reserve was lost at Fifth Fleet HQ. We've been using conscripts and national servicemen in our combat wings. These are people used to flying logistics freighters."

7579, "We're days away from running out of supplies and ammunition. Morale is rock bottom. We won't even last until reinforcements arrive. This is our last ditch effort to buy some time."

7585, "We're also monitoring the situation on the Morik war front. It looks like the entire Federation defense line is collapsing."

7586, "Someone in Federation Defense Intelligence buggered up, hard. The Combine used FDI's research data to build their superweapon, and the Feds just let it happen."

7587, "I'm talking about Solaris, and that data package you lot picked up in Mira. We suspect it goes back all the way to the beginning of the Elam war. The Federation weren't supporting the Republic out of friendship."

7588, "The Federation occupied the Mira system months ago, and that 'Combine' base you attacked, was actually FDI's."

7589, "The research base was destroyed before we could move in and salvage the data. However, it seems we got lucky."

7595, "The carrier entered Morik fifteen minutes ago with the Combine dreadnought Vindicator in pursuit. From Combine comms traffic it looks like Romanowska has also sent the Veritas to intercept."

7596, "The Osiris' fighter reserves have been spent. Without fighter cover she won't last long against a Combine dreadnought and battlecruiser. How do you all feel like playing heroes today?"

7597, "Ross, McKearney. You're Alpha wing. Both of you are the CAG's first choices for flight duty, so you'll fly the Phantom stealth fighters."

7598, "Phantoms are good at setting up ambushes against strikecraft and warship turrets. Use them well. They won't even see you coming."

7599, "Murphy, I want you to pull up a roster of who else we've got available. If they can hold a stick, they fly. No one gets to sit this one out."

7600, "XO, set a condition one throughout the ship. We jump in five minutes."

7601, "Hey. This doesn't look good. The Osiris and Task force 57 were stationed at Shen Kuo to garrison the system against Combine attack."

7602, "It was a powerful task group. Our entire operation here depended on Colvin's ships coming to our rescue."

7603, "If the Osiris is here, maybe Task Force 57 got hit by the Combine too."

7604, "Not that it changes anything. We do the mission. We get the Admiral out of there alive. Lancaster can sort that shit out later."
