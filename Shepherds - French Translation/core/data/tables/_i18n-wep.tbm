+Tech Description: XSTR("All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile.", 4530)

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers.", 4534)

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.
