Compass Rose arrived safely at her destination under the engine power of the Outreach. The executives at Trinity Holdings are delighted with the outcome and have thanked us for recovering the cargo. I hear the injured crew members are all doing okay.

In fact, I hear that Shafer has been fined a hefty amount and his master's license suspended. It seems the Sulsian Merchant Safety Authority wasn't impressed with the way he endangered his ship with that faulty impeller, citing several safety regulations that he breached. Nice to see a regulations agency with some teeth out here. Anywhere else, he'd have gotten away with it.", 3251)

I'm not too familiar with the Malika People's Militia. All I know is they're a fringe group in conflict with the Sulsian Hegemony, and the closest thing they have to a leader is an ex-soldier called Andri Gadaria. His stated goals are the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination' whatever that means. Up until now they've been running mostly guerilla operations, and despite the Sulsian military's shortcomings, the group have been able to be contained. I've submitted a report of our encounter to the Sulsian Navy. Their threat assessment of the local militia groups needs updating.
