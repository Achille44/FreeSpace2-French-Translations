The Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency concluded their investigation regarding recent rebel activities.  As suspected, the TDIA tracked the transfer of billions of credits from the HARC organization to the accounts of GTA pilots who have recently gone AWOL.  Brian Giordino, president of HARC was taken into custody early this morning and has been charged with high treason.  Giordino continues to proclaim his innocence and accuses the TDIA of setting him up."

The Vasudan ambassador has alerted us that the Vasudan Empire has chosen a new homeworld, Mandala Prime in the Manda system.  This news is troubling to the GTA because Mandala Prime was their greatest hope for successful colonization in the outer rim.  Of the hundreds of charted worlds, none is as environmentally similar to Earth as Mandala Prime and is obviously better suited for Terrans.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has already begun negotiations."

The ruthless mercs lured a boarding party under the flag of surrender and then murdered them by self-destructing their own ship.

Further, the E.L.F radio wave sent from Lockheed during the Timberland operation was apparently a trigger which detonated the bomb on board the Timberland.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to keep those mercs quiet about their employer.  We believe this someone to be Admiral Darcy.

6316, "The operation went smoothly.  The demolitions team was able to plant their special charge.  Long range scans show a perfect internal explosion.  Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.  GTA command believes that the removal of the cargo was undetected."

6317, "Extra congratulations to you for bringing your team back in one piece."

6318, "You failed to destroy all of the Manhattan's fighters.  This is pathetic work Alpha 1."

6319, "Unfortunately, you weren't able to perform a scan of the Manhattan cargo.  Fortunately, it was only schematics...however, had the freighter entered subspace with an unstable warhead...many lives would have been lost."

6320, "After the Manhattan blows, scan the area for cargo.  Once you find it, close to 150 meters and scan quickly."

6321, "Sadly, alpha wing is smaller upon return.  As the possibility of war with the Vasudans grows stronger, it becomes even more imperative to protect your wingmen."

The $f GTSC $f Barnett, a Faustus class science vessel has made an important discovery about the Shivans. She is now returning to Terran space with an escort of two cruisers, the $f GTC $f Nimitz and the $f GTC $f Galron."

6563, "News from the Vasudans:

''Today a patrol of Horus class fighters on patrol was attacked.  We do not know who the attackers were and all the sole surviving pilot was able to say before he lost consciousness was 'Today, I did not know who was the enemy....'.  Beware, Terran allies, for it seems the Shivans have a new weapon.''"

6564, "The $f Barnett is under attack. Go to the briefing room immiediately"

6587, "You managed to scan the unknown ship. Those readings were very helpful and lead us to unravel a mystery. The unknown ship appears to be a new form of Shivan technology. It was designed to override a ship's weapons computer and IFF to make the ship hostile to allied ships.

Luckily, the $f Barnett was carrying information which will help prevent this weapon from affecting us again. Good job, pilot!"

6588, "You have destroyed the unknown ship.  By doing so you have denied the Shivans the use of this weapon and bought us time to analyze the information on the $f Barnett."

7301, "Congratulations Pilot. Your performance during this mission was amazing."

7302, "We've just recieved a communication from the Vasuden High Command. They have reported that the captain of the Isis was a member of the Hammer of Light. 

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

With the destuction of the the GTD Prometheus, the Shivan threat in this area appears to be on the increase. The loss of the Prometheus will be greatly mourned.

Dismissed."

7303, "Try to do things differently. The mission can be a success if put your mind to it. Remember you have Bombers, and extra fighter wings. Use them!!"
