MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "Lieutenant Ross. We haven't met. Let's keep it that way. Crown HIGHCOM sends its regards." 6131 "08a-01"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "I work with Alban Naval Intelligence. I've been chasing Solaris, a Fed weapons research project that ANI got wind of a few months back. It looks like the Combine have managed to coopt Solaris for themselves." 6132 "08a-02"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "Commonwealth Military Command has also been monitoring the situation on the Morik war front. There's reports that the entire front line is collapsing." 6133 "08a-03"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "Someone in Federation Defense Intelligence screwed up, and screwed up hard. They must've known the Combine had used their Solaris data to build their own version, but they were still blindsided." 6134 "08a-04"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "We suspect that Solaris goes back all the way to the Elam war. The Federation weren't supporting the Republic out of the kindness of their hearts." 6135 "08a-05"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "The Federation wanted the Mira system, and I suspect that 'Combine' base was actually FDI's." 6136 "08a-06"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "The Combine destroyed the base before Alban Naval Intelligence could move in. However, it seems ANI got lucky." 6137 "08a-07"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "That intel you got from Juliet is the break we needed. I'm putting together a plan to get a copy of the data to ANI." 6138 "08a-08"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "Thanks to Lancaster's terrible operation security, you and McKearney are in the perfect position to help us crack Solaris." 6139 "08a-09"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 6130 "The Commonwealth presumes your cooperation in this matter. Let's not ruin a good thing, shall we?" 6140 "08a-10"

MSGXSTR "Murphy" 5324 "Hey. This doesn't look good. I'm not sure you know this, but Task force 57 was stationed at Shen Kuo to garrison the system against Combine attack." 6149 "08a-19"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 5324 "It was the most powerful task force in Fifth Fleet, other than the Morik garrison. Our entire operation here depended on Colvin's ships reinforcing our position." 6150 "08a-20"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 5324 "If the Osiris is here, it's likely Shen Kuo, and Task Force 57 have been lost." 6151 "08a-21"
