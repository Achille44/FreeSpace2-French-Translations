5379, "SQUADRON PROFILE - 52nd Nomads"

5380, "COMPOSITE SQUADRON VC-52 - THE NOMADS

Composite squadron assigned to aviation corvette GTCv Chanticleer.  Duties include space superiority, intercept, and light strike.  Currently authorized to fly GTF Aurora heavy reconnaissance fighters, GTB Artemis strike bombers, and GTF Perseus interceptors.  

CURRENT ASSIGNMENT: Operation MORPHEUS, Sol
COMMANDING OFFICER: Cmdr. Hannah Tompkins
BATTLE HONORS: 14-Year War (Vega Engagement, Operation THRESHER), Great War (2nd Ikeya), NTF Rebellion (1st Alpha Centauri, Koth Offensive), Second Incursion (Defense of Vega), Operation HESTIA (2nd Port Zheng)"

5381, "SHIP PROFILE - GTCv Chanticleer"

5382, "GTCv CHANTICLEER
Pennant No. R29 - Diomedes-class corvette, Block 20

The Chanticleer is a Diomedes-class corvette armed with four Bull Frost next-generation anti-warship beams in a pair of twinned lateral batteries.  The Diomedes-class relies on its startling agility to bring its firepower to bear. Designed to engage targets abeam, the class rewards flanking tactics and circling engagements against larger hostiles and aggressive action against multiple lighter opponents. Considerable sacrifices were made to operationalize the ship's fighterbay, but the potency of an onboard air wing justified the cost, particularly in the areas of point defense and counter-air. 

HOME PORT: Laguna Installation, Vega
CURRENT ASSIGNMENT: Operation MORPHEUS, Sol
COMMANDING OFFICER: Capt. Bryn O'Keefe
BATTLE HONORS: Operation HESTIA (2nd Port Zheng)"

5383, "DOSSIER - Lt. Cmdr. Ned Mozingo"

5384, "NAME: Edward Ravenscroft Mozingo
DOB: 2350-4-14
CALLSIGN: Transit
EDUCATION: BS, Chemical Engineering, Huntress College, Laramis II (2373); MS, Chemical Engineering, Hulldown University, Beta Aquilae Prime (2377)
DECORATIONS: Distinguished Flying Cross (2386)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Cmdr. Mark Chen, 202nd Lobos.  Mozingo is a fine officer, and one who leads by example. During Operation IRONCLAD, Mozingo assumed operational control of the mission with cool-headed alacrity after his squadron leader was shot down, driving off two wings of Federation gunships and saving the GTCv Radhanite from certain destruction. He has a natural rapport with his pilots, though it should be noted that his introverted, introspective streak can be a detriment to his duties as a leader."

5385, "DOSSIER - Cmdr. Hannah Tompkins"

5386, "NAME: Hannah Tompkins
DOB: 2348-1-20
CALLSIGN: Bourbon
EDUCATION: BS, Subspace Engineering, Huntress College, Laramis II (2371)
DECORATIONS: Capella Campaign Star (2367), Medal of Valor and Bar (2367 and 2385), Distinguished Flying Cross (2386)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Capt. Amanda Bakale, GTD Imperieuse.  Tompkins is a steady and cool-headed leader, focused on bringing her pilots home alive. Her performance while leading the 401st Ninetails during Operation MUSKETEER was notable.  Flying the GTB Boanerges in the heavy strike role against Aklan Station, Earth, her unit suffered unusually low casualties.  This can be attributed to Tompkins' energetic but caring command style, and the emphasis she places on combined operations with escort fighters."

5387, "DOSSIER - Ens. Lara Silverman"

5388, "NAME: Lara Silverman
DOB: 2364-2-15
CALLSIGN: Painter
EDUCATION: BS, Physics, 8th GTVA Officer Academy, Vega (2386)
DECORATIONS: n/a

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Capt. Jill Braibanti, GTVA 8th Officer Academy. Silverman is a promising young officer, but one who needs hardening under a veteran commander.  Her flight performance is consistently excellent, though there are justified concerns about her ability to stand up to prolonged combat psychologically.  Recommend that she be stationed under a commander with an empathetic leadership style to help her come into her own as a pilot and an officer."

5389, "DOSSIER - Lt. John O'Connor"

5390, "NAME: John Thomas O'Connor
DOB: 2359-5-22
CALLSIGN: Magellan
EDUCATION: BS/MS, Chemistry, University of New Constantinople, Beta Aquilae Prime (2382)
DECORATIONS: Medal of Valor (2386)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Cmdr. J. P. Sullivan, 212th Silver Scythes. Inside the cockpit, O'Connor is a talented pilot.  Leading the 212th's Epsilon wing during Operation MUSKETEER, O'Connor successfully escorted the bombers of the 401st Ninetails onto a heavily defended Federal target with minimal loss. But while his flight performance is good, his personality is at times abrasive.  O'Connor's out-of-cockpit adventures could also raise issues if given more responsibility."

5391, "DOSSIER - Lt. Alice Grinberg"

5392, "NAME: Alice Grinberg
DOB: 2360-12-4
CALLSIGN: Chanticleer Control
EDUCATION: BA, Psychology, Palmer College, Gulnara (2382); MS, Communications, Terran University, Vasuda Prime (2384)
DECORATIONS: Meritorious Unit Commendation (2385)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Capt. Bryn O'Keefe, GTCv Chanticleer. As a tactical officer, Grinberg is unflappable and cool under fire, distributing orders efficiently and professionally even in the most chaotic situations.  She is well-liked by the pilots of the Chanticleer's air wing, and widely regarded as a candidate for her own command someday. Her facility with the Vasudan language, in particular, is likely to be a major asset during joint Terran-Vasudan operations."

5393, "DOSSIER - Capt. Bryn O'Keefe"

5394, "NAME: Bryn O'Keefe
DOB: 2335-10-2
CALLSIGN: Chanticleer Actual
EDUCATION: BS, Physics, GTVA 2nd Officer Academy, Delta Serpentis III (2357); PhD, Physics, Stockton Institute, Ribos IV (2371)
DECORATIONS: NTF Campaign Victory Star (2366), Capella Campaign Star (2367), Medal of Valor (2367), Imperial Order of Vasuda (2367), Allied Defense Citation with bar (2366 and 2386)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Adm. Chiwetel Steele, GTD Atreus. O'Keefe's operational knowledge of the Diomedes-class's anti-air and anti-capital abilities are unmatched in the GTVA.  A wily officer in the vein of General Sherman, Captain O'Keefe is an interesting psychological specimen.  At once cynical and idealistic, O'Keefe detests war and bloodshed, but is absolutely willing to use violence to carry out his orders. All in all, an accomplished officer with the unswerving loyalty of his crewmembers."

5395, "DOSSIER - Adm. Chiwetel Steele"

5396, "NAME: Chiwetel Steele
DOB: 2340-7-13
CALLSIGN: Atreus Actual
EDUCATION: BS, Battlefield Psychology, GTVA 3rd Officer Academy, Capella (2362); MS, Strategic Studies, GTVA Space War College, Beta Aquilae Prime (2380)
DECORATIONS: NTF Campaign Victory Star (2366), Epsilon Pegasi Liberation Medal (2366), Nebula Campaign Victory Star (2367), Medal of Valor (2367), Allied Defence Citation (2367)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (excerpt):  Submitted by Adm. Xiaoqing Armanjani, Commander GTVA 4th Fleet. Steele's highly aggressive and precise nature makes him an interesting corvette skipper within the fleet. He often plays on the psychology of his adversaries, implementing careful ambushes structured around feigned retreats that would earn him the praise of Genghis Khan. His aggressive battlefield manner could be attributed to his fighter squadron background, however, he is yet to learn the art of restraint in regards to the pros and cons of overwhelming aggression during the engagement.

5397, "Welcome to Blue Planet. Check the techroom for weapon, ship, and intelligence updates."

5398, "You can press [V] to target a turret under your reticle. This is useful for disarming weapons and subsystems."

5399, "If you have wingmates available, remember to give them orders."

5400, "Feel free to adjust the difficulty. Blue Planet is balanced for play on all of them!"

5401, "Remember, press B to target bombs. Prioritize bombs, then bombers and beam cannons."

5402, "Watch out for bomb shockwaves. Some Blue Planet bombs have very deadly blasts."

5403, "Remember to conserve your Trebuchet missiles for use on beam cannons."

5404, "Don't forget to equalize your shields when under fire."

5405, "If you encounter any problems, visit www.hard-light.net and post in the Blue Planet forums, or visit the #BP channel on the HLP Discord."

5406, "If your HUD ever disappears after a cutscene, press shift-O."

5407, "The wake of Capella left the Terran half of the GTVA economically devastated."

5408, "To the Lost Generation, Earth is the hope that makes life worth living."

5409, "Unlike the Terrans, the Vasudans have prospered since Capella."

5410, "In recent years, the Hammer of Light has seen a quiet resurgence."

5411, "The Threat Exigency Initiative was the GTVA's crash response program to the massive Shivan threat glimpsed in Capella."

5412, "If you want to learn more about the Blue Planet universe, visit the techroom intelligence database."

5413, "Blue Planet uses Fury's AI, which allows AI fighters to use Trebuchet and dumbfire missiles, maneuver like a human pilot, and fire at the same rate as players. You may need to adjust your difficulty."

5414, "AI in Age of Aquarius and Freespace Blue can use all missiles properly and have various other FSO AI enhancements."

5415, "Warships in Blue Planet are very deadly. Fly with caution when the enemy deploys one."

5416, "Some fighters in Blue Planet have reverse thrust and even reverse afterburners. Hold your 'decelerate' control to engage reverse thrust, and combine this with afterburners to afterburn in reverse."

5417, "Friendly ships often have a powerful anti-fighter screen. If you are in danger, move close to a nearby friendly warship."

5418, "A variety of GTVA weapons have been redesigned for Blue Planet. You may find weapons like the Lamprey and Morning Star to be a lot more useful."

5419, "When you have an enemy bomber targeted, you can press J to see what it is attacking. Useful for giving your wingmen defence orders."

5420, "Pressing the U key targets unscanned cargo."

5421, "Take time to read the debriefing screen if you fail or die. A lot of them contain very useful hints."

But the rise of warship-grade beam weapons, combined with newer, more sophisticated rounds, created a requirement for long-range attacks against warship hulls and turrets. The Maxim now serves as a cornerstone of Alliance tactics, with heavy assault wings trained to mob targets and strip their turrets from beyond their range of reply. Enormous ammunition and power requirements and the need for barrel changes after every 4000 rounds fired prevent the Maxim from being deployed aboard warship turrets in most cases, and in any case, the design relies on the firing platform's ability to reposition.

Although described to pilots as a powerful, short-range particle cannon, the Kayser is in fact more like a quantum safecracker. The device fires constellations of subatomic particles entangled and suspended in a state of quantum uncertainty. When the constellation strikes a target, an unknown interior feedback mechanism collapses the constellation into a state lethally attuned to the target's structure. Damage is inflicted by sprays of virtual particles that emerge from the quantum vacuum. Shivan weapon examples used this mechanism, but ineffectively, and Alliance technicians were able to apply a set of filters which clamp the possible outputs to a narrower range.

5997, "The RNI Tactical Beam System, codenamed 'Forge Eagle', is a mid-range tactical plasma beam with an efficiency-boosting twist. It uses a sweeping magnetic bottle to guide a relativistic plasma stream through contained arcs. Although it offers limited hull penetration, it is capable of firing even without accurate targeting solutions. Current GTVA combat doctrine calls for these weapons to be used to disarm or disable enemy vessels quickly. Forge Eagles are used as the main weapons of the flexible Deimos corvette and as a battery weapon on larger warships."

Incapable of prolonged individual bursts, it relies on its relatively short recharge time to compensate for its low damage output. The Forge Dove is an unhappy compromise, arguably inferior to the fusion mortar system it is mounted alongside."

6004, "During its engagement with the Sathanas juggernaught, the GTVA Colossus overloaded its 'Crypt Hammer' beam emitters, forcing additional power to the magnetic bottle and increasing plasma core feed rates. Overloading beam weapons is not standard practice on GTVA warships, but as confidence in power grid and heat sink handling has increased, trained crews have begun drilling on tactical weapon overloads. This comes at the cost of subspace engine recharge and emitter endurance."

Reliable, accurate, easy to maintain, and highly robust, the Crypt Hammer remains a favorite of Terran warship crews. It provides the main tactical power of Orion and Hecate combatants. It has one of the lowest failure rates of any GTVA weapons system, but it produces copious heat and its mountings are bulky."

The 221b Beam System is used as a supplementary weapon on Vasudan destroyers, where it has earned high praise - it outperforms even Shivan beam weapons. Unexpected heat issues prevented it from being mounted on Vasudan cruisers, leaving them tremendously anemic against warships."

This striking piece of technology, later implemented in next-generation beam weapons, was developed by the Akheton Corporation based on systems used in the SDG. Sophisticated but power-hungry, the 255a outperforms its Terran equivalent by a small margin."

Mekhu Enterprises science teams focused on maximizing beam effect rather than power, using an arcing magnetic bottle to cut a path across the target. Due to Vasudan expertise in power grid design, the 183 outperforms its Terran equivalent by a small margin. The Sobek corvette makes good use of this weapons system."

Ten years after Capella, this investment produced the pulse cannon, a radical improvement over older weapons like the Houndtooth. With vastly enhanced range and velocity, the Hellstar Pulse Cannon fires heavy plasma pulses out to 2.4 kilometers, giving modern warships - including the Erebus-class destroyer - a third heavy weapons system to complement beam weapons and torpedoes. Potent against both shields and hull, the Type 1 Hellstar can smash fighters in a few hits and deal serious damage to warship targets.

Mounted on most next-generation Alliance warships as a battery weapon, the 'Aurora Wake' supplements its own dedicated reactors with feeds from the ship's drives. Prone to overheating, this system is perhaps the most cantankerous of the next-generation beams. Mass issues encountered while mounting the beam on the Chimera corvette led to that vessel's relatively thin armor plating.

6101, "Anti-fighter beams have always been an afterthought in GTVA weapons development.  Big, flashy anti-ship beam projects invariably take the lion's share of engineering talent and funding, and what remains is typically taken for conventional weapon systems.  Even private defense contractors seem to see no future in the concept.  This, more than any engineering bottleneck, is why the Phalanx anti-fighter beam has remained unchanged for the last 25 years, even as the ships it is mounted on and the weapons it is mounted alongside grow ever more capable.  

While the growing deficiency has been noted by ship captains, political support for a replacement never materialized.  Instead, prospects for a replacement came from a different source: a wager between two engineering teams at the Ophion Field Dynamics Laboratory in Beta Aquilae.  While the specifics of this wager are not recorded, both teams set to work on reviving a dead field.

The obvious thing to expect was something along the lines of 'Phalanx, but better', or a version of ULTRA that addressed its reliability and targeting problems.  Instead, the design team produced a fascinating weapon.  Using grossly oversized capacitors feeding an emitter no larger than that of the Phalanx, the 'Helicon Spear' Dual-Purpose Beam System is by far the most compact anti-warship beam ever designed.  A weapon of frighteningly high power for its size, but with a dynamic beam envelope agile enough to track fast-moving strikecraft and ordnance. 

The weapon's ravenous appetite places a lot of strain on power systems, and because of the beam's high yield, it is very sensitive to changes in its comparatively lower intensity magnetic bottle.  Without a full lock (an uncertain prospect against rapidly maneuvering targets), the beam envelope tends to ablate on shield matrices, resulting in partial power discharge before impact with the hull.  This issue will remain until the installation of more powerful magnetic field stabilizers, ideally mounted on a full turret assembly. "

6103, "Vishnan Beam Weapons"

6104, "Vishnan beam weapons, like those of the Alliance and the Shivans, are relativistic plasma weapons. Unlike their Shivan and Alliance counterparts, Vishnan beams use a strip of gravitationally altered space-time, rather than a magnetic bottle, to guide the beam to its target. Gravity is a significantly less powerful force than electromagnetism, so the power requirements should be enormous and the efficiency reduced, but Vishnan beam weapons nonetheless outperform our own. Hasty examination of Vishnan warship debris suggests that they lack internal heatsinks. Scientists hypothesize that the Vishnans may sink heat through standing subspace gates. Although Vishnan beam weapons are powerful and frequently outperform Shivan equivalents, they do not seem capable of the extreme scalability that allows the Shivans to generate weapons like the Sathanas juggernaught's main guns.

Design was already in progress when the Lucifer detonation collapsed the node, and as the GTA in Sol lapsed into irrelevance, the program faltered. When the newborn Federation issued its first requirement for a tactical and patrol combatant, the Sanctus cruiser, the Uller was resurrected from Han-Ronald archives to provide light point defense. The Uller improves on older Djinn and Houndtooth designs primarily through improved power draw and heat generation. However, the Uller Block 0 does offer a slight damage improvement over the older Houndtooth. More impressively, Han-Ronald engineers were able to extend and improve the magnetic bottle, increasing the weapon's range and speed drastically. Unfortunately for Han-Ronald, these weapons continued to underperform against shielded fighter attack, and were rapidly rendered obsolete by new Jovian point defense weapons. They continue to serve in a limited fashion aboard Federation military and civilian shipping, primarily as antiwarhead defenses, where their three-kilometer range and pinpoint accuracy is a boon to early bomb intercept.

Firing explosive-tipped ceramic rounds, the Varunastra-A can inflict punishing damage to corvettes and destroyers alike. Although Karuna frigates can snipe at range with their gauss cannons, they must close in to the 4-kilometer range of the mass driver to decisively conclude the engagement.

Excellent range and precision compensate for laughably small damage from a depleted uranium penetrator, allowing Federation captains to disable enemy beam weapons, turrets, and subsystems from a safe distance before closing to attack. This tactical flexibility is a major deterrent to simple assault by the GTVA. Hecate destroyers in particular are critically vulnerable to this form of long-range salvo attack. Karuna frigates routinely use their Gauss Cannons to harass targets, forcing GTVA ships to break their formations and charge or be rendered ineffective.

As the Alliance's standard-issue anti-warship munition, the Cyclops defines the term 'bomb': it performs a lengthy scan cycle to analyze the target's armor and systems state, locks on, separates, and thrusts to impact while at risk of point defense fire. When fired in large volleys, the Cyclops provides good probability of hit even against modern warships, but the threat environment has grown so hostile to bombers that it is clear the Cyclops' time is limited. The special issue Helios antimatter bomb is largely restricted to anti-Sathanas FIREBREAK units, and Cyclops procurement has run so rampant that the GTVA sometimes sells consignments of older warheads off for use as mining tools despite the security risk. The Myrmidon space superiority fighter's Block 6 upgrade enables it to serve as a fighter-bomber, carrying Cyclops torpedoes.

In recent conflicts, the Artemis strike bomber has become the primary Cyclops delivery platform, since it can perform 'dive bomb' attacks in which it delivers the warload at close range. These tactics are institutionally and politically incendiary.

Today, the Alliance's sluggish antimatter production struggles to stockpile enough Helios warheads to meet the threat of a third Shivan incursion. If the Alliance could build or obtain a solar antimatter farm, Helios production would jump by an order of magnitude, but this orbital infrastructure requires economic investment that instead went to the Sol Gate.

It saw limited action during the Second Shivan Incursion, serving on front-line units with the Neo-Terran Front and as a combat evaluation fighter with the GTVA. The Ulysses remains in very limited production, but has been completely retired from front-line GTVA formations."

6464, "The Erinyes had barely entered its OpEval period when the Second Shivan incursion began. It served with SOC units and, later, elite line squadrons, where it gained a reputation for massive firepower but low sustainability. Mounting the UD-8 Kayser probability weapon, the Erinyes' eight gun banks and good secondary capability give it tremendous killing power. But its reactor cannot handle the strain of sustained fire, and its maneuverability leaves something to be desired. Although it proved effective at massacring most Shivan fighters, and went into wide-scale production during the Threat Exigency Initiative, it remains an oddly paradoxical design - an excellent killer but a limited fighter. As agility became more and more critical to fighter design, the complex Erinyes proved impossible to re-engineer. Although it remains in service with elite squadrons for heavy space superiority missions, it will soon be superceded by the next-generation GTF Nyx."

Reassigned from intercept to multirole combatant after its sterling performance during the Second Incursion, the Perseus is cheap, flexible, and an excellent dogfighter and interceptor. In a pinch it can perform anti-subsystem strikes on warships with Stiletto II bombs. Even with the advent of next-generation fighters, the Perseus will remain in service for years to come."

6468, "GTF Myrmidon"

6469, "The Myrmidon fighter, designed by RNI Systems to fulfill an impossibly broad request from the Admiralty, is a space superiority fighter with problematic handling, the primary firepower of an assault craft, and three secondary banks of unusual design and limited capacity. It is gradually being phased out, but still serves as a line fighter, bomber escort, and battle group guardian across the Terran elements of the Alliance fleet. Some pilots achieve a particular affinity with this unusual craft, but in general its wide target profile has given it a reputation as a pilot-killer. Captured Neo-Terran Front pilots reported that the Myrmidon was respected for its firepower but considered too clumsy for its role."

6472, "The Aurora is a heavy reconnaissance fighter designed to replace the Loki in its intended role of scouting, interception and space superiority. The Aurora is a swift fighter and carries several advanced avionics and sensor systems to assist in the gathering of information. However, the added equipment has produced a heavy hull, limiting the combat manoeuverability of the design. Aurora fighters are currently undergoing mission trials with the 14th Battlegroup in the Sol system."

6474, "GTF Kulas"

6475, "The GTF Kulas is a light fighter in active deployment in the GTVA Navy. The Kulas existed as a paramilitary light fighter long before the conception of the Threat Exigency Initiative, but the deployment of the fighter into the front lines is officially recognised as the incipient event of the TEI's Wave One program.

In the aftermath of the Second Shivan Incursion, the GTVA fleet was exhausted and demoralised. Fighter strength was at its lowest since the Great War and several GTVA systems were at dangerous levels of unrest. High Command authorised a crash program to make replete the Terran fighter corps as part of the first steps towards rebuilding the GTVA navy. Utilising a venerable but versatile paramilitary spaceframe, RNI Systems spearheaded the modernisation of the Kulas and began bulk production of the light fighter.

The Kulas suited the post-Incursion fleet perfectly. The fighter already had a low power draw - upgrading the reactor gave an almost limitless reserve. She was still average in performance, but she now had the ability to maintain peak performance for longer than any other fighter in service. Her capacitor allowed for extended afterburner usage - though faster fighters would beat her in a sprint, none could match her ability to run marathons. Armed with the ultra-efficient Balor cannon, pilots were able to shunt more power to shields on the fly, improving the surviveability of the design. Finally, a light hull afforded a maneuverability which pilots loved, making the Kulas a superb dogfighter.

The GTF Kulas would never reach the heights of the advanced fighters that would succeed her. She would be outpaced by future interceptors, outgunned by new assault fighters and outperformed by modern huntresses. However, she would become emblematic of the first wave of strikecraft in the Threat Exigency Initiative - a versatile multi-role fighter that could perform any task asked of her with the endurance to carry on in a difficult post-Incursion environment."

Produced in record time by the Alliance's first wholly classified procurement and design process - plagued by rumors of intrigue and mysterious 'red assets' - the Atalanta is an elegant, minimalist design wholly devoted to murdering other strike craft with very nearly Shivan flight characteristics. The original specifications of the Atalanta called for a multirole interceptor and space superiority fighter. Due to the United Earth Federation's fighter corps' successes, this variant has been field-modified to enhance its capabilities in the space-superiority role. These fighters remain rare in the Terran theatre, but they are likely to become a mainstay of Alliance forces in the near future."

6482, "A product of the second wave of Threat Exigency Initiative fighters, the advanced GTF Nyx is one of the newest GTVA heavy fighters, falling somewhere between multirole heavy assault/space superiority niche and the Vasudan concept of a space dominance fighter. The design was fast-tracked in 2385 as a response to increasing fighter losses to superior UEF fighter designs. A dedicated gunship killer, with heavy armour and firepower, this fighter has become the bane of many a UEF pilot. It marries the Erinyes' eight gun banks with the agility and versatility of the Perseus interceptor, producing a sterling design that has become a pilot favorite. Extraordinary cost, however, has slowed its planned deployment."

6484, "Triton Dynamics/Nankam Aeronautical"

6485, "Analysis of defensive actions during the Second Incursion, such as the evacuation of Third Fleet Headquarters in Capella, revealed systemic failures in defensive fighter coverage. Multi-axis attack by lightly escorted Shivan bombers demanded rapid redeployment across kilometers of space, and in terms of pure linear speed, no Terran fighter design was up to the challenge. When the Threat Exigency Initiative was launched, one of the first demands of the GTVA admiralty was for a new dedicated fighter design in the pure intercept role, a tactical niche left empty since the retirement of the GTF Valkyrie in 2361.  

The result of a rare collaboration between Triton Dynamics and its longtime competitor Nankam Aeronautical, including subcontracts to Snapka-Flegel and Boone Thrusters, the Draco was accepted for combat evaluation trials a few weeks before the outbreak of the war in Sol, conducting peacekeeping and customs operations in the Terran periphery.  Its stunning speed and fast recharge drive capacitors quickly made it a pilot favorite. 

Evaluation did not complete in time for the departure of the 14th Battlegroup, and GTVA Command further held back its deployment to the Sol theater for fear that it would be easy prey for UEF point defenses and the heavier Kentauroi.  While it remains a rare sight, these concerns were largely unfounded, and thanks to a doctrine of evasion and attack by pure speed, the Draco now enjoys one of the highest kill/casualty ratios of any Alliance strikecraft in the conflict. Although its light weapons suite - designed to engage Shivan bombers and intercept warheads - leaves it arguably undergunned when attacking heavier UEF strike craft, the Draco nonetheless exerts a powerful tactical presence, dictating terms of engagement and placing its opponents firmly on the defensive."

6488, "After a strong showing during the NTF rebellion, Artemis bombers now represent the majority of the GTVA's tactical strike ability. Maneuverable and cheap, the Artemis is able to deliver its payload rapidly. Tactical analysis suggested that bombers rarely survived prolonged engagement, so the Artemis' limited warhead capacity is considered non-problematic. Without defensive turrets, the Artemis is reliant on fighter escort, but it can dogfight if pressed. This behavior is strongly discouraged during pilot training, but because Artemis bombers are often deployed with inadequate escort, it frequently becomes necessary. The bomber's single primary bank is often fitted with a Maxim cannon for supplementary firepower."

6494, "GTB Ursa"

6495, "Fifty years after the Great War, the Ursa bomber still serves the GTVA as an inflexible but powerful anti-shipping platform. With limited speed, the Ursa struggles to reach its targets, and in spite of heavy armor it cannot survive engagement with even a single interceptor. Its large target profile renders it vulnerable to flak and beam fire. Tactical doctrine calls for Ursa deployment against destroyers after their antifighter defenses are disarmed and their fighter complement depleted. Designers today consider the Ursa a dead end, and strive to manufacture bombers with fighter-like maneuverability and speed."

6498, "A controversial new heavy bomber at the time of the Second Incursion, the Boanerges proved a logistical dream but a mixed blessing tactically. Heavily shielded and with a large payload, the Boanerges eschewed defensive turrets as 'of limited use'. Bomber pilots did not react positively to this decision, and although the Boanerges is at least capable in its role, it still divides pilots today. Good maneuverability allows the Boanerges some success in reaching its targets, but in spite of heavy armor it cannot withstand defensive fire from warships or interceptors. It is an open question whether heavy bombers will remain tactically relevant. For the moment, however, the Boanerges' easy maintenance, cheap assembly, and long lifespan make it common in the heavy anti-shipping and anti-installation role."

With only a single defensive turret and minimal armor, the Elysium should, one post-Capella swarm combatant refit notwithstanding, never be deployed in combat. But its small logistical footprint, fuel economy, and low downtime often put it in harm's way. The Elysium's single greatest asset may be its robust and flexible docking system."

6538, "GTC Hyperion"

6539, "Oldest of the next-generation GTVA warships, the Hyperion cruiser represents the Alliance's best shot at a new niche for the aging cruiser hull - a scout, skirmisher, and anti-fighter platform that can conduct reconnaissance by fire, draw off bomber wings, and engage larger ships from range with its Thorn Lance light beams.

With corvettes dominating the the main line combatant role, cruisers must be deployed - and built - more carefully. Hyperion captains train to respond to their many predators, including heavy assault wings and beam-armed warships.

After Capella, the Threat Exigency Initiative launched a push for new military technology and doctrine. At the center would be a next generation of warships, more agile, sophisticated, and survivable than their ancestors: capable of sliding around Shivan concentrations and applying force to gaps and weaknesses.

They would also be more expensive. Unfortunately, the Terran economy had just flown into a supernova.

GTVA High Command issued a requirement for a next-generation cruiser that could serve as an escort, skirmisher, and screen element. It would have the anti-fighter prowess of the Aeolus, a highly capable subspace drive, next-generation power systems, and electronic warfare capabilities. All this was true, but it was also a smokescreen.

In truth, the Hyperion-class cruiser was an attempt to shake down next-generation systems...and next-generation procurement. The Admiralty took a torch to the connections between the officer corps and Alliance contractors, then rebuilt the procurement system with brutalist efficiency. Careers flared up, burnt out, and spiraled off into nothing around the Hyperion as teams fought to get their systems on-board.

Economic sequestration placed the Hyperion in danger of cancellation, and suddenly project teams began withdrawing, trying to avoid tying their technology to a failed warship. This left the baffled hull designers with no choice but to build a ship without knowing what equipment it would carry.

The team drew on experience with the Deimos corvette to build the ship from the reactor out, selecting a simple hull form and flexible power grid. This allows the Hyperion to easily mount new systems. Even the forward beam cannons are trivial to replace if destroyed, since the emitters are isolated from the plasma cores.

The first block of Hyperions served as a testbed for meson reactors, pulse weapons, and next-generation beams. Although successful as anti-fighter pickets and reasonably affordable, they didn't hit the mark for subspace agility or anti-ship firepower. The class is still rolling through a series of block upgrades, expanding electronic warfare capabilities and installing survivability packages for the main weapons.

The Hyperion is notorious for the so-called 'bad quench' failure mode of its meson reactors, which severely limits the crew's chances of survival in the event of a hull loss."

6540, "GTCv Chimera"

6541, "Corvette"

6542, "The Chimera corvette is the archetypical next-generation warship, a flying beam cannon with a superb subspace drive and power grid. Designed to kill destroyers and Sathanas juggernauts, the Chimera mimics the shock jump tactics of the Second Incursion, drawing on the new ISN BACKBREAKER strategic communications and sensor fusion standard to plot jumps and find targets.

In combat, the Chimera points at the biggest ship around and fires until there's nothing left to shoot at. Three Aurora Wake main beams provide unsurpassed killing power for the hull size. Clouds of vaporized coolant gave the corvette the unflattering nickname 'the bong'. Thermal management is a major concern, and the corvette could easily destroy itself with unwise tactics, but the ship's power grid handles well.

Defensively, the Chimera counts on next-generation active armor and an array of pulse and beam weapons to screen it from bombers. Like all next-generation corvettes, the Chimera must be ready to serve as a destroyer escort.

Chimera production is ramping up, with the perhaps-ambitious goal of matching every Deimos battleteam with a single Chimera by the end of the century. With the exception of the beam reactors, the class came in well under budget.

Of all the TEI's next-generation warships, the Chimera had the smoothest development. Data from the Hyperion class allowed designers to choose simple priorities very early: light hull, huge guns, good heat sinks, good drive, all other concerns secondary. The power grid actually overshot the target, providing the class with excess capabilities that could be exploited by a Block 2 upgrade.

Unfortunately for Chimera crews, no amount of excess power has yet provided a solution for the corvette's abominable living conditions. A software error stocked the first example of the class, Pilum, with thousands of identical pre-cooked meal pouches, each one broccoli and tofu - leading to the much-beloved story of the Cooks' Mutiny. Live on a flying gun, the saying goes, and you get treated like a bullet."

6543, "GTCv Bellerophon"

6544, "The Bellerophon heavy corvette is a logical variant of the Chimera, mounting an Ice Queen destroyer-grade beam in place of one of its little sister's Aurora Wakes. The Bellerophon fills the exact same niche as the Chimera, but it brings more force to the battlespace.

Advocates of the Diomedes corvette fought hard to kill the Bellerophon, claiming it was redundant with the Chimera. But VEGADEX data suggested that marginal gains in speed-of-kill on hard targets like destroyers and juggernauts could create vital strategic opportunities. A difference in seconds could win victory. The Admiralty upheld the design requirement.

A special team directly under High Command expanded the hull into a triangular shape, hollowed out a space for a self-contained Ice Queen and thermal systems, and packed the new hull volume with command electronics and sensors so that the Bellerophon could serve as a corvette leader. When operating in a pack with other corvettes, the Bellerophon can integrate sensor data to generate fast and accurate navigational solutions. The Bellerophon actually contains more classified equipment per hull volume than any other main-line Alliance warship.

Some thermal issues plagued the first two spaceframes, leading to the installation of a hot-metal heat sink on the ventral hull.

To the dismay of Fleet crew, the Bellerophon shares a common life support space with the Chimera."

6545, "Main Beam"

6546, "GTCv Diomedes"

6547, "Conceptualized early in the Threat Exigency Initiative warship program, the Diomedes-class strike corvette was shaped by the necessities of two worlds: the tactical realities of the post-Capella battlefield and the political turmoil of a Fleet in crisis. 

	GTVA designers conceived the Chimera and Bellerophon-class corvettes hand in hand with new doctrines of of massive force application. These designs were intentionally overspecialized to neutralize Shivan destroyers and juggernauts with beam alpha strikes. Strike craft support, aggressive subspace maneuvering, and sheer shock would, it was argued, allow the Chimera and Bellerophon to outrun their own design weaknesses.

	But more conservative factions of the GTVA military agitated for a less specialized next-generation design, a successor to and improvement upon the still-young Deimos corvette. Politically, they needed a warship that would fit the operational profile of line as well as elite units, but they also offered compelling tactical reasoning. Agile, aggressive combatants lacked the staying power for prolonged defensive operations at hardpoints, nodes, or convoys. A cheaper, more all-round design could supplement Deimos production with a powerful corvette leader or a supporting element to cover the flanks of destroyers or sister corvettes. Other camps in the Fleet added their own requirements: the addition of a fighterbay would open up possibilities as an SOC platform, or in the independent strike role through organic escorts or bombers. Missile launchers and magazines would allow for selectable munition loads.

	The notional Diomedes became a rallying point for design schools who had been pushed out of the main thrust of Threat Exigency Initiative work. The design went forward, but these competing requirements should have produced a catastrophic compromise.

	Instead, GTVA designers produced a fascinating warship, one whose weaknesses are addressed by carefully counterpointed strengths. Armed with four Bull Frost next-generation anti-warship beams in a pair of twinned lateral batteries, the Diomedes relies on its startling agility to bring its firepower to bear. Designed to engage targets abeam, the class rewards flanking tactics and circling engagements against larger hostiles and aggressive action against multiple lighter opponents. Considerable sacrifices were made to operationalize the ship's fighterbay, but the potency of an on-board interceptor or bomber unit justified the cost, particularly in the areas of point defense and counter-air. The Diomedes' weapons suite also includes light pulse cannons and a pair of missile launchers capable of anti-fighter or anti-warship fire. Unburdened by massive beam weapons, her reactors permit a modestly rapid jump cycle and excellent ESM and active armor capabilities.

	Even as the GTVA has cracked down on its own patronage system, dissolving the lines of influence that connected warship designers and commanders to particular schools, the Diomedes has acquired a reputation for scrappy flexibility and solitary pluck. Neglected by formal doctrine on the eve of the UEF-GTVA conflict except as a general 'flank escort' and 'fast response expedient', Diomedes captains drilled their own tactics and built a quiet professional community. 

	The ongoing conflict has found the Diomedes thrown into the fire, often alone, often undersupported, acting on sketchy intelligence to provide decisive force at key moments. Casualties among the Diomedes class exceed that of any other next-generation warship, but GTVA commanders have taken note of the design's successes, and of the discipline and capability of her crews. Once seen as the ugly duckling of the TEI warship line, the Diomedes now finds itself in strategic and tactical demand"

6548, "Missile lnchr"

6549, "GTD Titan"

6550, "The Titan-class destroyer/strike carrier bases more fightercraft than any other Alliance vessel. Armed with a mighty triple array of 'Ice Queen' spinal beams, a battery of pulse weapons, and Supernova meson torpedoes, the Titan serves as a companion to the Erebus-class line destroyer.

In the event of a new Shivan incursion, the Titan will hold in support of its Erebus partner, deploying its fighter wings to generate and exploit openings. In this respect it resembles a larger Hecate-class. But the Titan also shares the Erebus' excellent subspace agility, and its main beams make it a capable shock attacker. Developing doctrine suggests that the Titan will serve either as a firefighter, leaping onto and erasing Shivan breakthroughs, or as a force lever to punch through vital targets.

Titan development proceeded under the codename COLD WEDGE. The first attempt drew on design principles from the Massive Mjolnir and Supercarrer design camps, but it failed when Triton Dynamics studies suggested the hull's ammunition stores would be catastrophically vulnerable. A second attempt began under a Vasudan project leader, but internal politics caused great offense, and only a hasty diplomatic intervention by Aya McCarthy retained the Vasudan team as a reactor lead.

The third iteration of the Titan design drew heavily on the Ravana destroyer, creating an eerie reputation around the team offices. The hull coalesced around a hangar module, a main beam spine, and a sophisticated engineering section for the drive and reactors. BACKBREAKER and SCORPION PROPHET combat management and network software coordinate the ship's systems, with added facilities for precise attacks out of subspace jumps. The Titan's power systems and ammunition stores are highly distributed to enhance resilience. Multiple emitter arrays give the Titan excellent long-range sensor and command capability. Because the Titan's role requires fewer sudden power transfers than the Erebus, its power grid is more conventional and less integrated, closely following the pattern established by the Hatshepsut.

Considerable dispute rages over the best use of the Titan's tactical presence. The class could serve as a supercarrier, an attrition sniper that leaps between hot spots and picks off primary targets, a floating reserve, or the hammer in a fix-and-fire team with the Erebus.

A long waiting list has developed for Titan postings, in part because of career opportunities for fighter officers, in part because of the type's excellent quarters. Conspiracy theorists often debate whether a module exists to replace the hangar bay with a long-term habitat so the Titan could serve as a deep-space ark."

6559, "The Erebus-class destroyer. Humanity's sharpest sword. Primary force concentration asset in the Threat Exigency Initiative's doctrine of effect warfare. A triumph of achievement in the face of adversity: both economic and existential.

The mission of the Erebus is to enter a tactical situation and successfully resolve it. No matter the threat, the Erebus is designed to deploy tactical intelligence, subspace agility, weapons fire, its onboard air wing, battle group command, and strategic connectivity in a unified plan to degrade and destroy the foe. Tactically, the Erebus depends on nothing.

Implicitly, the Erebus is meant to duel - and win against - small groups of Sathanas juggernauts. 

Armed with a WINTER KING long-range spinal beam cannon, an ICE QUEEN coaxial main beam, an array of anti-warship beams, a battery of massive pulse weapons, a comprehensive CIWS close-defense suite, selectable-load SARISSA-M1 torpedo launchers with subspace attack capability, and an active armor suite tougher than the Colossus, the Erebus is a killer. Her weapons layout suits her role as a door-kicker, plunging into formations of smaller warships, but she can also outrange a Sathanas juggernaut for as long as necessary to defang its weapons.

But a modern Alliance admiral asks about the weapons last. The platform's truly revolutionary capability lies with her tactical systems.

The Erebus' heart is an integrated power system fed by redundant meson reactors. Her overengineered grid can safely surge combat systems ranging from sensors to main beam weapons by orders of magnitude. Slurry heat sinks and generous thermal tolerances permit tactical overloads in emergency situations. Buttressed electronic countermeasures managed by a Vasudan SCORPION PROPHET combat net degrade the effectiveness of all incoming fire, from main warship beams through aspect-seeking warheads down to the very basic primary weapons of strike craft.

That same power system feeds a revolutionary sprint drive, a multi-core subspace engine capable of rapid subspace transits. Erebus' sensor/navigation fusion capability can retask classical and subspace arrays between tactical and navigational needs. A cutting-edge navigational system with a dedicated n-space active battery array cuts down calculation times and, some allege, permits at least tenuous plotting of multiple chained jumps.

Communications systems built to the Alliance's BACKBREAKER standard provide common operational capability in the face of most jamming, but the Erebus also boasts a command theater for battle group coordination in non-permissive comm environments. The Erebus' informational weapons systems are built to partner with a Titan-class destroyer, incorporating the Titan's air wing and battle group into force awareness. When multiple Erebus-class destroyers operate in the same theater, BACKBREAKER can designate a group leader or coordinate a flat, decentralized operational schedule which intelligently distributes tasks across the Erebus battle groups. Future upgrades may integrate AWACS capability directly into the destroyer.

The Erebus' primary design tradeoffs lie in her fusion drive, air wing, and logistics. As a line combatant, the Erebus carries few strike craft. She is as fast as a Sathanas, but no faster, relying on her subspace drive to keep the range. And while tactically independent, the Erebus requires more logistical tail than many next-generation warships.

Cataclysm gave birth to Erebus. The death throes of the GTVA Colossus killed more than thirty thousand officers and crew - and an entire philosophy of warship design. The detonation of the Capella star wiped out not only a densely populated system, but an entire concept of strategic action. No more would the GTVA depend on monumental centerpiece combatants, designed to draw the enemy into a single set piece engagement and score a knockout blow."

As if haunted by its origins, the Sekhmet maintains a ferocious reputation. Mekhu produced a spectacularly expensive juggernaut of a bomber, heavily armed and plated in molybdenum, a pocket warship stitched into a compact frame. The Sekhmet's power plant and drive actually make it capable of dogfighting at par with many fighters. Many of the design techniques used in the Sekhmet remain highly classified, and the spaceframe is still exclusively produced by Vasudan military corporations. No other bomber in the Alliance arsenal can strike in such a wide range of tactical environments.

Although once rare, the Vasudan economic boom has enabled widescale Sekhmet production, fulfilling Khonsu's requirement for organic fleetwide anti-destroyer capability. Training for a Sekhmet post is intense, ritualistic, and exclusive. Rumors of Hammer rituals plague the corps.

The Vasudans saw the Terran-Vasudan War primarily as a conflict of symbols and will. Very few Vasudan leaders believed that a civilized, spacefaring people could commit planetary-scale murder. However, the Vasudans saw the aggressive, paranoid Terrans as simplistic and unstable, and they sought to communicate by violence in terms the Terrans would respect. Vasudan tactics prized disorientation, violence of action, and psychological effect, up to and including suicide tactics.

The Typhon-class destroyer was built to incarnate Vasudan pride, a purposeful echo of the Terran Orion. Built in formidable secrecy, the original Typhon featured anti-fighter missiles, heavy plasma weapons, and a staggering hangar capacity. At the Vega engagement, a Typhon-class destroyer closed with and destroyed the GTD Eisenhower, while the Typhon's air wing decimated the Terran Fourth Fleet. The victory was both symbolically and strategically critical.

During late Reconstruction, the booming Vasudan economy fueled a new fleet, and Vasudan designers faced a choice. The Terrans had elected to build the new Hecate-class, a destroyer that could serve as a fleet carrier. The old Orions would be retained as line combatants. In Terran analysis, future engagements would be resolved primarily by air wings, with corvettes providing escort and artillery support. Destroyers would remain in safety.

Vasudan analysis from the Kames Admiralty placed more weight on decisive action by destroyers on the front lines. A requirement was placed for a modern destroyer to serve as a spearhead, and the Typhon, suffering power grid issues with its new beam weapons, was re-roled as a fleet carrier and second-line destroyer. The role of symbolic supership would be inherited by another design.

Modern doctrine keeps the Typhon as a garrison destroyer, watching over the buzz of Vasudan trade and intrigue. A number of Typhons also serve as arsenal ships, armored with heavy ship-to-ship torpedoes."

6574, "Terran pilots often advance two complaints against Vasudan fighters. Their gun placement is poor, and they often cannot survive in a non-permissive environment. Vasudan aces reply that what is most important is the ability to avoid that threat environment in the first place. The Horus light interceptor lines up with both the complaint and the rejoinder. A nimble high-speed attacker, the Horus fares poorly when being shot at but offers skilled pilots a wide range of maneuvering options. At the time of the ship's design, Vasudan tactical philosophy prized the ability to penetrate and disrupt enemy groups, since placing the enemy on the defensive was seen as the key step to victory. The Horus excels in this role, and with modifications to use modern long-range missiles, it can serve as a sniper and skirmisher. Like most Vasudan ships, the Horus remains in production in some capacity, built by Sentences with industrial capability. The Horus-Ur is an example of modern builds."

Next-generation Vasudan fighters can allegedly manufacture their own ordnance and regenerate damaged systems in the field. Some analysts suggest that this is a myth, as the IVN has continued to maintain and upgrade the Nephthys. The latest block is stealthy and extremely quick. It is possible that onboard sustain systems are limited, or that the IVN simply wants the support ship available as an option for its older craft."

6625, "The Sanctus class cruiser is a ship with a troubled development history.

In the 2350's the future shape of the Federation space military was proposed in BULWARK's Strategic Imperative Paper, describing a garrison force operating inside a highly developed supply and intelligence infrastructure. Federation warships would be supply-hungry, but capable of ferocious high intensity combat to contain any invasion force. The requirements for the Future Fleet Cruiser were heavily influenced by this document, and a variety of imaginative doctrines were proposed by competing defense contractors.

The Sol element of Han-Ronald Corporation eventually won the contract to build the Sanctus, drawing upon its years of cruiser design experience to conceptualise a hybrid cruiser-freighter. Deploying a wing of Sanctus cruisers alongside a Solaris destroyer would relieve the logistical strain of deploying these behemoths in combat, while providing area defense and fire support for the destroyer's air wing. Strike capability was already filled by the Purusha frigate - cruisers were anticipated to be deployed as part of a battlegroup.

The Sanctus turned out to be an unhappy compromise. The ship was substantially larger than any previous cruiser in service, yet its weapons barely outstripped that of a Fenris. Cargo space was limited by the need to host the ship's own weapons and combat systems, and though critical spaces were sufficiently protected, the cargo hold had a desultory armour scheme that left it vulnerable to a determined attack. Due to ongoing trade route raids by Gaian Effort forces, the role of the cruiser was switched from the relatively supported fleet cruiser role to that of convoy escort, to which the Sanctus was poorly suited.

In the immediate aftermath of the Gaian Effort campaign, Admiral Calder began an extensive refit program to all Sanctus cruisers to replenish Third Fleet's strength. The cargo hold was removed and armour improved around vulnerable areas. Light torpedo launchers, new point defense and burst flak weaponry were added. The result was a tactically flexible weapons platform, powerful against strikecraft - if somewhat undergunned against larger warships. Throughout the course of the war with the GTVA, Earth and Mars would began a similar process of upgrading Sanctus cruisers and deploying them as attack cruisers. It was not until the second refit of the Sanctus where deficiencies in firepower and armour were finally addressed and the design would reach its full potential as a line combatant."

They are capable of limited torpedo strikes against soft (or, when supported, hard) targets and have adequate point defenses to handle bomber attack. The Custos is notable for its highly modular design, a quality which made it economical in peacetime and flexible in wartime. The directive to prepare Custos units for front-line combat led to a crash upgrade program that enhanced the Custos' agility and electronic warfare capabilities in order to give it a fighting chance against beam attack and heavy assault wings armed with swarm missiles. Orders were also placed for Custos spaceframes modified from the keel up for expanded capabilities, but these craft were apparently never produced. The Custos is now deployed as an ad-hoc convoy harasser, screening element, and electronics warfare platform to anchor maneuvers by other Fleet elements."

Outfitted with a staggering array of primary cannons as well as a stripped-down Varunastra mass driver, the Custos-X's primary mission was to infiltrate and assault Kostadin assets in the vast unchartable wasteland of the Kuiper Belt."

6637, "UEFg Purusha"

6638, "The Purusha was a frigate in service in the Federation Navy.

In 2356 the Strategic Imperative Paper was released by the military intelligence group BULWARK. This was a landmark document that had two aims: to identify areas of improvement from previous fleet doctrines and to deduce what would be required of the nascent Federation Navy. The Paper was the harbinger of a period of volatility in warship design. The defense industry had been long constrained by economic depression and military collapse - it now had the means and mandate to implement radical new doctrine. In this period several revolutionary new concepts were birthed, some more successful than others.

One such revolution was the frigate. This new line of warship was conceptualised as a strike platform to occupy a space within the yawning chasm of capability that had existed between cruisers and destroyers. Frigates would be better armed and armoured than cruisers, but cheaper to build and operate than a capital ship. These new warships would have the teeth to engage major hostile assets in battle, but not be so singularly valuable that their potential would be unrealised by skittish admirals. The incorporation of a small fighter hangar into the design was debated at great length by the Admiralty, with the decision being made not to sacrifice armour and firepower. Fighter carrying capacity would be left to the destroyer flagships as per previous doctrines.

The Purusha emerged as the first of her kind and for a time she was the pinnacle of post-GTA naval power in Sol. The first Purusha rolled out of the dockyards in 2363, and at a stroke rendered every other combat warship in Sol obsolete. She had more firepower than any cruiser that came before her, armed with mass drivers and heavy antimatter torpedoes. Utilisation of supply-hungry but energy-efficient ammunition-based armaments allowed the majority of her reactor output to be allocated to engine performance. She was twice as fast as the venerable Fenris strike cruiser despite the frigate's superior tonnage, armour and firepower.

The Purusha was extensively deployed against the Gaian Effort, suffering significant losses during Third Fleet's campaign in the system outer rim. With the introduction of the Karuna, she was reclassified as a light frigate and phased out of frontline duty. No Purushas remain in the order of battle of the Federation's three line fleets. Most hulls of the class were decommissioned and yarded in case of emergency reactivation. A few demilitarized Purushas still fly as fast couriers for private interests."

6640, "UEFg Karuna"

6641, "The Karuna is a class of frigate in the Federation Navy, birthed out of blood spilled against the Gaian Effort. Utilising swarm tactics, Gef strike fighters would overwhelm Sanctus military freighters and Purusha light frigates with impunity. Facing mounting shipping losses, the Admiralty outlined their requirements for a next-generation frigate. The exigencies of the conflict had affirmed the criticality of a ubiquitous fighter escort. It was not enough for fleet destroyers to deploy wings to support warships in the field - frigates would need to bring their own fighters to battle. Imperatives by DARK CLOUD and BULWARK to the Federation College of War refined the design - the new frigate would need to run her own escort as well as threaten hard targets in the event of Shivan incursion. 

The Karuna frigate carrier turned out to be a veritable fortress. Up to eight fighters could be fielded in the forward hangar, and her powerful suite of flak and rapid-fire cannons proved devastating against hostile strikecraft. Three VLS silos supplementing a forward battery of gauss cannons and mass drivers gave her the teeth to engage hostile warship assets. She was swift and maneuverable, able to quickly respond to threats in a fluid battlespace. The Karuna was the right ship built at the right time - a sorely needed solution to the chronic problem of maintaining security in a fractious post-Isolation system.

Karunas are widely deployed in the current conflict with the GTVA and form the offensive backbone of all three Fleets."

With the GTVA specializing in rapid beam strikes, it has become apparent that the standard weapons loadout carried by the frigate, geared towards peacekeeping duties and attrition warfare, is insufficient to deliver sufficient counterfire in direct combat. This proposed upgrade, tentatively called the Karuna Mark 2, is intended to address these deficiencies by replacing several of the original's Flak cannons with Mass Drivers, as well as installing launch systems for the Slammer Area Denial System. Active armour belts at critical points have been improved, and crew requirements have been lowered through a greater use of automated systems than previously thought practical. However, implementing this upgrade to existing Karuna hulls currently requires a long stay in a fleet yard, a luxury the UEF cannot afford given the fleets' operational status at this time."

She was an evolution of the frigate warship line that began with the Purusha and was refined with the Karuna. The next-generation heavy warship concept was first realised with the powerful but ultimately aborted dreadnought prototype. Admiral Calder's Murugan Project aimed to address the deficit in offensive firepower by focusing on a main battery of mass drivers. This contrasted with the defense-oriented Solaris destroyers with their massive Apocalypse swarms. When the audacity of the Murugan precluded further investment in dreadnought development, the Heavy Frigate project gravitated towards economical tried-and-tested designs.

The Narayana heavy frigate eventuated from this, essentially taking design elements of the Karuna and expanding on them. The hull was lengthened to accommodate a greater fighter and shuttle hangar capacity. Mass driver and gauss cannon firepower was augmented and concentrated forward. This meant the frigate's entire offensive fire could be brought to bear at a single target, in contrast to the Murugan whose turrets divided her firepower across multiple vectors. Point defenses were weaker than the Karuna's as a result of the expanded main battery but it was anticipated the Narayana's greater fighter carrying capacity would make up for the shortfall.

The heavy frigate was built when the only hardened targets the Federation Navy had engaged were old System Rim fortresses commandeered by the Gaian Effort, with the occasional armed mining ship pushed to service as a capital ship. When the GTVA launched its invasion of Sol, Narayanas proved completely inadequate to counter the advanced beam weaponry of TEI corvettes. Many frigates were lost during the opening stages of the conflict. In what would later be memorialised as a particularly inspired act, Admiral Netreba of Mars' Second Fleet authorised a massive refit of all Narayana frigates, installing specialised artillery weapons capable of engaging hostile targets at extreme range. Federation forces have since won several key engagements where the frigate's artillery forced Alliance warships to withdraw from combat.

The refit Narayana would serve with great effectiveness throughout the conflict with the Alliance. However, the long-range guns took up space otherwise occupied by fighter hangar facilities - the artillery frigate would no longer be able to house fighters within its diminished hangar. Because of this they would prove to be vulnerable to strikecraft attacks, shock jumps and cruiser groups, which aggressive, dynamic Alliance commanders were able to exploit ruthlessly."

They represented a massive investment of resources and manpower that, according to critics, was fundamentally unnecessary. Designed by an ad-hoc committee of the Federation's best engineering and tactical thinkers and built at Mars' Bradbury Fleet Yards, these enormous warships seemed like answers to a nonexistent problem.
There are currently 3 ships of this class in service: the Solaris under Admiral Byrne, the Eris under Admiral Netreba, and the Toutatis under Admiral Calder. They each serve as both flagships and primary strategic deterrents for their respective fleets.
The Solaris class' primary firepower is delivered via 12 Hwacha Mk 2 missile launchers, each capable of firing up to 4 missiles before a reload cycle. Secondary armament is comprised of fast-firing mass drivers designed to kill enemy turrets, supplemented by a comprehensive suite of point defense and Flak Turrets.
They also carry a sizable fighter complement, befitting their role as carriers. While the Solaris destroyers themselves have barely seen combat in the war, their impact on the strategic situation is enormous, and the actions of their fighter wings are critical in the Federation's defensive efforts. Each Solaris serves as a single-handed 'fleet in being', deterring a crushing GTVA assault."

The Gaian Effort grew out of Reverend Iain MacDuff's generosity in these days, and, in turn, the warship Morena MacDuff grew out of the gradual disintegration of MacDuff's dream.

As those who had turned to MacDuff for protection and salvation splintered into numerous cells, many diverging from his agenda, MacDuff armed the Morena and used it as an enforcer. Over the decades, Kostadin Cell has expanded the ship by accretion, adding new armor, weapons, and power systems in a cascading and almost biological growth. Confined to a few carefully plotted jump points by the subspace hazards of the Solar periphery, the MacDuff looms as a symbol of Kostadin Cell's hardline politics and MacDuff's madness.

The vessel is named after MacDuff's beloved wife, whose remains are rumoured to be enshrined deep in the bowels of the warship.

Subsequent scan data of this vessel clarified the ship's true form and capabilities. 

The cruiser-sized Andraste is the meridian of Gaian Effort ingenuity in adversity. A fast and well-armed vessel, her design combines the powerful engine array of a Federation light frigate with the hull and reactor of an Alliance cruiser, utilising Effort weapons technology - nuclear-tipped slug drivers, plasma turrets and heavy fusion missiles. Like most major Gaian Effort assets she is equipped with highly sensitive subspace sensors to allow safe navigation of the remote Kuiper Belt reaches.

The Ares entered service just as the Shivans stormed Capella, and what few units were available saved thousands of lives during escort missions. Despite a stormy production history, the Ares is now a front-line combatant, used in heavy assault missions, pop-up Trebuchet strikes, and critical defensive missions.

Too lightly armored to withstand assault fighter attacks, unable to meaningfully engage other warships even after upgraded with beam weapons, and bogged down by inefficient reactors and an obsolete spaceframe, the Fenris is now used solely as a target or a patrol cruiser. Cramped quarters and an inflated crew count due to obsolete automation make posting to a Fenris into a punishment detail."

Terran-Vasudan shield systems were designed aboard a Faustus during the Great War, and when the Alliance discovered the Knossos portal 32 years later, the same class of science cruisers carried Mina Hargrove's team to their fateful work. Easily destroyed by even a single enemy fighter, the true worth of the Faustus lies in its onboard information and laboratory systems, including neural-net computers capable of agnostic response to a broad range of problems. Some see the Alliance's failure to develop a tactical science ship as a major failure. Others point to the constant race for grant money as an explanation for the longevity of the Faustus, since no one can afford a new ship. Whatever the case, an end to the current economic recession might see the design of a new lead science ship. Until then, the Faustus will continue to be upgraded and repurposed by those in search of truth."

Wherever a secure gas giant may be found, pilots can expect Zephyrus operations.

6771, "The GTD Carthage is one of the oldest capital ships still in service with the Alliance fleet. Launched towards the end of the Great War, she has participated in most major campaigns fought by the GTVA, and her accumulated combat record is unparalleled. After she was nearly destroyed during the nebula campaign, she was refitted as a Combat Evaluation Unit Destroyer to field-test new armor, propulsion and ECM designs. Exact details are unavailable, but we do know that her anti-fighter armament has been substantially upgraded to allow her to survive in today's fighter-centric combat environment. We have also found indications that she has been fitted with a prototype sprint drive, essentially a second subspace drive for enhanced strategic agility. Her hull plating, in combination with her extensive redesign, have increased her combat survivability by several orders of magnitude. 

While the ship has been in active duty for the better part of 50 years, ONI estimates that destroying her or achieving a mission kill will take a lot of careful planning and a lot of firepower. The Carthage and her escort fleet have been under the command of Admiral Anita Lopez for 15 years, and while her command is primarily composed of old ship designs, all the rough edges have long since been worn away, and her Battlegroup is consistently found in the top 10 percent of the GTVA's Fleet Performance evaluations."

6772, "GTD Hecate"

6773, "The Hecate carrier was designed for rapid, efficient fighter operations rather than direct combat. The Second Shivan Incursion proved the value of this strategy, but also highlighted its flaws. Whenever Hecate-class destroyers found themselves in direct combat with hostile warships, they failed to perform. The Hecate now makes up the bulk of the GTVA's destroyer fleet, and, in line with current fighter-heavy strategic doctrine, serves as a rear-area base for strike craft operations. Hecate destroyers never enter combat without their battlegroups. Superior fighter capacity and an excellent flight deck make the Hecate an extraordinarily flexible power projection system, and this ability is at the center of the GTVA's planning for future Shivan threats."

6775, "The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay. In the post-Capella era, Arcadias have assumed the role of system evacuation hubs, where civilian traffic rallies to take on refugees in case of Shivan attack."

Aken Bosch rediscovered this portal in Ancient records, then incited the Neo-Terran rebellion to gain access. After the NTC Trinity powered up and transited the device, Shivan warships jumped through from the other side, initiating the Second Shivan Incursion. After extensive study by Doctor Hargrove's team, the Knossos was destroyed by meson warheads in an effort to contain the expanding Shivan threat.

Study of the Knossos technology led to breakthroughs in node engineering and the construction of the Sol Gate, which captured and stabilized a transient node to the Sol system, re-establishing Alliance contact with Earth. The economic and scientific demands of the project were colossal, but the Alliance is optimistic that renewed traffic with Earth will rapidly recoup both fiscal and strategic costs."

6793, "Developed at the Hideki Institute in Vega, the meson bomb is a strategic antimatter weapon of appalling power. Exploiting staged meson decay to unleash energies locally approaching the Big Bang environment, these weapons are temperamental, unbelievably expensive, and vital to defense doctrine. Only large clusters of meson weapons can reliably collapse subspace nodes, preventing Shivan outbreaks. The long firing sequences and relatively short range of strategic meson weapons make them unsuited for tactical applications except in the field of demolition, since enemy forces can outmaneuver or even disable the weapon. But tactical variants of this technology have now entered the GTVA arsenal."

After the Joint Tactical Platform was canceled in favor of the Anemoi logistics ship, military exigency pushed the Asteria forward as a supply outpost in contested areas.

It is due to be augmented, but not replaced, by the new Bellerophon and Chimera corvettes. Molybdenum armor and Vasudan reactors give the Deimos excellent survivability and the ability to jump early and often. Deimos corvettes will continue to be produced for decades to come."

6826, "The Cretheus gunboat, officially a Fast Picket, is a small, cheap, agile escort with dedicated antifighter defenses, limited anti-warship ability, and a tortured design history. The prototype was fielded during the Second Incursion, intended as a cheap, numerous escort platform armed with eight Flak Turrets. But the first prototype was lost during its OpEval period in a classified operation on the fringes of the Capella system, and the findings of the loss investigation pointed to unacceptable vulnerability to hostile beam-armed warships. RNI designers protested that the ship was never meant to operate under such conditions, but lobbying by the Akheton Corporation, which hoped to push a variant Mentu design into the light escort role, managed to block the other prototypes from deployment to Capella where, ironically, they might have saved tens of thousands of lives lost to Shivan bombers. The spaceframe was brought back into consideration during the first wave of the Threat Exigency Initiative, but Morgan Technologies asked for it to be held back until it could be packaged with first new fire control systems, then provisions for their new pulse weapons, then improved flak magazine storage. The design entered mass production two years before the Reunion in a number of variants, but the Akheton Corporation again held back its deployment, and it is only now being cycled into the Sol theater where it is intended as a gunship deterrent and point defense picket."

It performed well at the time, but as warships got tougher, the Osiris simply couldn't carry the payload required to score kills. Pulled from front-line order of battle, the Osiris remains in service with Vasudan system defense forces, armed with anti-subsystem munitions for police and customs work. Although obsolete Terran spacecraft are generally used as targets or sold off, the post-sorrow Vasudans have a tradition of private ship maintenance that keeps old designs in circulation. A spacecraft, they argue, is an obscenely expensive and intricate piece of technology, and it must be appreciated for its practical and historical worth.   

In recent months a surprising number of Osiris spaceframes have been purchased by Terran military contractors. Speculation suggests that the Terran defense establishment, frustrated with attrition in the strike bomber corps, has decided to look elsewhere for inspiration. The twin-turreted Osiris may represent performance data of interest. Interestingly, the terms of purchase neglected the usual stipulation for Terran environment and control refits."

6868, "GVB Bakha"

6869, "The first modern strike bomber to enter the Alliance arsenal, the Bakha is an economic triumph. Built around two baffled Akh-12 engines, ancestors of the Ptah's stealth drive, the Bakha's elegant spaceframe won the hearts of hangar crews across the Vasudan navy. Slightly tougher than its Terran counterpart, the Artemis, the Bakha also boasts two separate primary gun banks. Defensive dogfighting is an integral part of Bakha pilot training. Perhaps most importantly, the Bakha passed through design and qualification in record time, and its production line is extremely economical. This makes the Bakha a natural partner to the hideously expensive Sekhmet.

The Bakha came to life almost wholly through nepotism and favor-trading. Fortunately, all the relatives involved were competent professionals with the best interests of the Vasudan people in mind. By the time of the NTF rebellion, shipyards over the grave of Vasuda Prime had turned out more than six thousand Bakhas. As the rebellion began to target Vasudan civilians, Bakha squadrons scrambled to protect Vasudan interests from NTF warships. One famous squadron, Atinmerit's 808th, violated standing orders and conducted pre-emptive attacks without fighter escort against NTF rallying points. This story provided the inspiration for the smash hit This Price I Pay. 

Like many products of the Pa-anmu Admiralty, the Bakha suffers when faced with layered anti-fighter defenses. Bakha squadrons developed SEAD tactics using Trebuchet and Stiletto missiles. Although the Bakha could not carry the Maxim cannon during the Second Incursion, Serapis fighters provided improvised support.

The single greatest failure the Bakha ever suffered related to the Helios warhead. The software hastily distributed for the Helios capability accidentally treated the weapon as a primary gun, not a guided warhead. Technicians aboard the Psamtik had to write their own code to get the Helios operational in time for the attack on the SJ Sathanas.

Modern marks of the Bakha fly under the designation Apis Bakha."

Nothing says it better than the Isis, a common tugboat, shuttle, repair ship, and light transport - which is also the deadliest commando ferry in the Alliance inventory. Armed with a pair of Mekhu HL-7 close defense weapons and powered by the beloved Akh-4 powerplant, the Isis can insert boarding parties or repair teams even in live combat. The Terran arm of the fleet has quietly purchased a number of Isis transports, and the Vasudans habitually up-gun them for use as tactical gunboats. The Isis remains in wide production. The design's only notable weakness is its limited payload."

6875, "GVFr Ma'at"

6876, "The dowdy Ma'at dates back to Vasudan commerce in the 14 Year War, where it trundled massive cargo containers from system to system. The advent of shields neutered the Ma'at's defensive armament, but the real blow to the design was the Bes' propellant efficiency, which gave it a huge marginal advantage over the Ma'at on the same routes. Today, Ma'at freighters fly civilian runs, serviced by a cooperative of Vasudan artisans who produce upgrades and replacement parts at rates cheap enough to offset the Ma'at's operating costs. The famous Vasudan Ambassador Thot-hartis favored a Ma'at for hauling her extensive collection of diplomatically useful art, relics, and conversation pieces."

6877, "GVFr Bes"

6878, "The beetle-backed Bes is the avatar of Vasudan Reconstruction. Commissioned twelve years after the end of the Great War, the Bes is a weapon of peace, admired both for its sleek aesthetic and its incredible propellant efficiency. The Bes hit the Vasudan shipping market like a snort of black sand. It could just keep moving and moving, slashing operating costs and commodity prices. It helped propel an economic boom that flowered into a new Vasudan golden age. Although Emperor Khonsu II is often credited for the design, he only intervened to resolve a dispute that had kept the engine snarled in production, the victim of a grudge that spiraled off the McCarthy Affair. In this respect his wisdom was surpassing. Today the Bes swarms trade lanes, cheerfully keeping up the flow of commerce. Vasudan attitudes towards objects are complex, and the Bes seems to carry an aura of awe and fear, as if it has built up too much success and must someday be rebalanced. Bes crews traditionally grow desert flowers in the condenser spaces. Pilots should note that the Bes is a frail target, with limited survivability against heavy assault craft - a tragic weakness during the NTF rebellion and post-Capella violence. However, its two turrets provide a capable addition to convoy warhead defense."

6881, "GVFr Satis"

6882, "The Satis is a Great War-era freighter originally built for wartime self-defense. Armed with five plasma turrets, it could pose a serious threat to unshielded fighters, freeing up strike craft for offensive action. The rise of fighter shielding killed the Satis' original role, leaving it stranded as an economically inefficient freighter. But the Satis remains effective at warhead intercept, so it's often salted into convoy groups as a self-defense supplement. Vasudan Tactical Command has explored upgunning the Satis for light fire support."

6883, "GVG Anuket"

6884, "A curious hybrid, the GVG Anuket serves the Vasudan fleet as a gas miner, fleet tender, and sophisticated science ship. As a miner it harvests deuterium from gas giants, weathering harsh electromagnetic environments to feed the fleet's thirst. As a tender, the Anuket is a single-solution refinery, converting raw materials directly into usable fuel. During Vasudan operations in the Second Incursion's nebular theater, the Anuket was refitted with a powerful sensor suite, including subspace tracking equipment. Onboard laboratories and hot rooms helped Vasudan scientists study the supernova remnant. In the years since Capella, the Anuket's mission creep has expanded, and a number of task modules fitted inside the tanker's cavernous holds now enable the hull to serve as a lab ship, listening post, medical transport, and limited electronic warfare platform. The huge sprawl of onboard mission software has created concerns about security flaws.

The Anuket has no meaningful self-defense capability beyond a single Crow Lash flak gun, but it can contribute to warhead intercept with light CIWS. The ship's snowballing mission capabilities led to Terran complaints that pilots would have no idea whether to treat an Anuket as a tactical asset or a bomb.

The new Tawaret logistics ship has similar refining capabilities to the Anuket, but it is specifically a military asset and does not serve in a commercial role."

6885, "miner02va-claw1"

6886, "GVC Aten"

6887, "In the post-Capella era, the Aten has been reclassified from cruiser to heavy picket. A senescent design, fragile and agonizingly undergunned, the Aten killed thousands of Vasudan officers and crew during the Second Incursion by simple inability to defend itself. Swarms of Shivan Basilisk fighters proved a particular menace, since their missiles were too small for intercept, but the Aten's lack of anti-warship beams meant it was no match for Shivan cruisers.

The Vasudan preoccupation with history and lineage is a source of real friction in fleet doctrine. The Vasudans, loathe to waste functional spacecraft, actually continue to maintain the Aten as a convoy escort. The hull has been upgraded to the Aten-Re standard, with enhanced active armor, hardened subsystems, a pair of modern KHAFRA BURN energy flak guns, a capacitor system feeding an Akheton pulse cannon, and improved TAG awareness for fire support. The pulse cannon provides interdiction and area denial capability against small groups of strike craft. Expanded automation collapses crew requirements to 250, leaving much of the hull uninhabited. These pickets serve as convoy motherships, packing components, fuel, and medical systems to manage any en-route emergencies.

The next-generation Vasudan cruiser, the GVC Akhenaten, fills the fast strike and skirmisher requirement that the Aten never met."

6888, "GVC Mentu"

6889, "The Mentu should've been the Vasudan Navy's modern strike cruiser, built from the keel up to mount a pair of Mkh/Akh 121b anti-warship beams. A typically superb powerplant, including acoustic baffles engineered to rumble at pleasant frequencies, would keep the Mentu charging along at good speed even while operating the weapons. Intelligence and publicity documents from the Mentu's development make it clear that the design was meant to showcase Vasudan anti-warship beams.

But the Mentu was another ironic casualty of its ancestor's vices. The Aten cruiser was so cripplingly unsuited to front-line action that it would be reassigned as a convoy escort and rear-area picket once the Mentu joined the fleet. But leading members of the Kames Admiralty, who saw the future in direct action by modern destroyers, refused to accept the absence of an anti-fighter cruiser on the front lines. Destroyers could take out enemy warships, with fire support from the new corvettes. Someone had to shoot down all the bombers, and it certainly wouldn't be the fighter corps.

Through a series of manipulations that encompassed finance, social life, and art, the Kames Admiralty misdirected the Mentu's engineers about the heat requirements of the Mkh/Akh 121b. The result was a superb strike cruiser - without the heatsinks required to operate its own main weapons for more than a few shots. The 121b performed too well to be rebuilt. Less than six months before its OpEval period, the Mentu was redesigned as a fast escort with its main beams downgraded to Phalanx anti-fighter beams.

The officers responsible escaped prosecution, as they had simply arranged to be misunderstood. Their malfeasance may have saved lives. The Mentu served in the Second Incursion as a fast escort cruiser, swatting warheads and bombers with an excellent CIWS and interdiction arsenal. Tough, long-lasting, and well under budget, the Mentu worked well with the Sobek corvette in a sword-shield pair. Early in the war, Mentu captains developed the infamous Against Apsu maneuver, flying the GVC Somtus and GVC Mycerinus belly-to-belly to take advantage of their weapons and armor layout in an engagement against the NTF.

Ever since, Mentu captains take pride in the command to roll ship. The modern Mentu-Ra uses slurry coolant, finally granting it the heat capacity to mount anti-warship beams. It is the principle cruiser of the IVN. Older Mentu variants still serve as escorts, armed with pulse cannons and energy flak."

6890, "GVCv Sobek"

6891, "The Sobek is a superb ship-to-ship combatant, a brutal sword of a corvette that specializes in direct attacks against hostile warships up to destroyer size.

Military historians mark the Sobek as the beginning of the Second Incursion warship design era. After the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the SD Lucifer, the Admiralties issued a requirement for a new class of warship, a heavy destroyer escort that would be able to destroy any Shivan cruiser in single combat and make an accounting of itself against Shivan destroyers. The first Sobek design was long and slim, built around a pair of railgun-assisted flux cannon, a Vasudan torpedo weapon. The Sobek's designers also built a meticulous power grid in anticipation of future shield capabilities. Terran observers classified the ship as a corvette.

Warship-scale shielding failed to materialize, but beam technology matured, and the Sobek's reactor and hull profile proved a good match for the Mkh/Akh 182. This early beam cannon suffered range and accuracy issues. It pumped more matter than cruiser-scale beams, but lacked the huge plasma core clamps and bottle controls of destroyer-scale systems. Test fires tended to cavitate and fail into a spectacular but ineffective blowtorch.

Unlike Terran designers, however, Vasudan procurement occasionally makes concurrency work. Mekhu solved the blowtorch issue with the Mkh/Akh 183, which allowed the magnetic bottle to swivel, sacrificing accuracy for effect. Two of these beam weapons replaced the flux cannons in the Sobek's spine, operationalizing the Alliance's first corvette. Doctrine deploys the Sobek as a killer, focusing down single targets with the forward beams. In main fleet engagements, Sobeks seek out and prosecute any threat to friendly destroyers.

During the Second Incursion, the Sobek-class Dashor escorted the GTD Carthage during initial containment in Gamma Draconis. During the botched attack on the SD Ravana, the Khenmu outmaneuvered the Shivan destroyer, surviving to provide vital fire support. The Tatenen made first contact with the Sathanas, transmitting telemetry on the juggernaut's forward beam weapons even as it died to them. The Renenet and Thebes engaged Shivan forces during the campaign to destroy the Sathanas, taking out the SD Beleth and countless fighter wings. Again and again, Sobek corvettes proved their worth, even under impossible conditions.

The modern Sobek-Ra features enhanced active armor and EW capabilities, as well as a reactor refit and a total point defense upgrade to improve the Sobek's survivability against strike craft attack. The IVN deploys the Sobek-Ra as its mainstay warship alongside the Aaru-class heavy corvette."

6893, "GVSG Edjo"

6894, "For fifty years running, Vasudan strategists have been trying to wean the Alliance off its addiction to deep-space supply depots. Depots were a major feature of Great War logistics, and a combination of institutional inertia and dependability keeps them in the logistical chain, despite their vulnerability. Even the Shivans exhibited depot behavior. But the post-Vasuda Imperium wants no part of anything that can't pick itself up and run.

One of the most obvious and passive-aggressive elements of this movement is the Vasudans' continued inability to build a decent sentry gun. When the Alliance requested that the Vasudan Navy upgrade the Ankh, they produced the Edjo, a substandard sentry gun by any measure. Although sentry guns are sometimes deployed by warships as close-defense options, the Vasudans seem content to use the ancient Ankh in this role.

Since Capella, the Terran military has moved towards more mobile logistics. A next-generation sentry weapon is definitely in production, but the IVN treats it as a tactical asset and refuses to share."

6895, "GVA Setekh"

6896, "The Setekh Advanced Warning and Control System is a vital sensor and communications asset in Vasudan battle groups. It's also an acrimonious political flashpoint. The Terran Charybdis AWACS is cheaper, more compliant with GTVA operational standards, more secure, and better-defended. The Setekh's only real advantages lie in its compartmentalized hull design, which saves it from small fighter weapons, and its superior passive sensors. Yet the IVN insists on manufacturing and deploying the Setekh, insisting it is more suitable for Vasudan purposes.

During post-Capella political tensions, Terran admirals saw this is an intentional snub and a maneuver to deny contracts to Terran manufacturers. Accusations of economic warfare met with an angry response, and today the issue remains sore. In the meantime the Setekh has been upgraded to modern standards, providing the full range of AWACS services - precision jump navigation for friendlies, aspect lock jamming, ECCM, interception and decryption, and limited defensive stealth. Whether the Vasudans have integrated SSM spotting capability remains classified. Terran pilots refer to this vessel as the Steak."

6897, "GVD Hatshepsut"

6898, "The Hatshepsut-class destroyer is a flying fortress, one of the finest capital warships ever designed by the Alliance. With an aggressive, backswept prow, a gleaming palace superstructure, and a thunderous fusion drive array, the Hatshepsut looks as good as she fights.

The Hatshepsut was born from the Kames Admiralty's decision to focus the fleet on decisive action against hostile destroyers. The Hatshepsut would mount modern beam weapons, missile silos, and a cutting-edge CIWS grid of flak weapons and anti-fighter beams. She would carry fewer fighters than the Typhon, but still maintain a strong air wing. Her command and informational systems would help Sobek-class corvettes select and prioritize targets. The design requirement was delivered in a series of exemplary Conversations, balancing the appeal of the Hatshepsut project against the prestige and history of rehabilitating the Typhon. As a result, the Hatshepsut team performed solemnly and correctly, avoiding some of the excessive overspecialization typical of excited Vasudans.

One major stumbling block was the ship's hull form. Early designs produced a long-neck, squat-based spaceframe. Designers agreed that the lead destroyer class of the Vasudan Navy could not look like it was about to be beheaded at the altar, so a number of sensor and command systems were moved to an arrowhead bow structure, improving resolution at a slight cost in latency.

During the NTF Rebellion, Hatshepsut-class destroyers leapt into front line combat, jumping from battle to battle and engaging NTF forces with only light escort. The golden ships became icons of Vasudan hope and targets of vendetta for the NTF. The type's formidable flak screen proved an incredible deterrent to fighter attack, and aggressive maneuvering covered for some blind spots in her turret coverage. Hatshepsut captains successfully used the ship's dorsal 255a anti-destroyer beams in circling and topsiding maneuvers, but the Hatshepsut's most fearsome reputation came from tactics against cruisers. Warships such as the Psamtik would safe their main beams, divert the power to subspace drive recharge, and close to destroy NTF vessels with anti-fighter beams, flak, and salvos of fusion mortars. The tactic harmed NTF morale, since it was clear the destroyers were more concerned with getting to the next fight than anything else.

The Psamtik was lost to the second Sathanas juggernaut in a risky deployment, but overall the Hatshepsut-class performed superbly. Production continues to this today, and the latest Hatshepsut Amaru features modern pulse weapons, extended flak range, enhanced command awareness under BACKBREAKER, expanded torpedo magazines with long-range anti-warship capability and anti-fighter interdiction, and slurry heatsinks. The Hatshepsut serves as an elegant front-line combatant alongside modern heavy warships such as the iKhemu-Sek."

6899, "GVF Seth"

6900, "The Seth is a Great War-vintage Vasudan strike craft designed to both protect and destroy bombers. It meets this requirement in particularly Vasudan fashion, slow to keep pace with bombers but equipped with a superb afterburner to chase them. The Seth's incredible Mekhu-Sahr plasma power plant gives it design longevity, leading to significant Vasudan smugness about the value of putting good power systems above all other concerns. Pilots point to the Seth's slim target profile when closing or retreating as key to mastering the craft. Although the Seth's fore-mounted sensors are extremely vulnerable to beam fire, Vasudan pilots take pride in resolving engagements without aspect lock. As a decades-old favorite, the Seth has seen continued production in the maze that is Vasudan private industry. The Set Mace is a popular modern variant."

6901, "16 Meters"

6902, "GVF Thoth"

6903, "A frail little beetle of a dogfighter, the Thoth was once a dreaded sight for Terran pilots. Nimble and armed for only a single mission, the Thoth could prey on Terran fighters and bombers, setting the terms of the engagement and performing quick slashing attacks. In this light the design's widely spaced guns make sense, because repeated pinpoint hits are less important than consistency over multiple attacks. As the lethality of warship point defenses evolved, however, the Thoth's huntings grounds dwindled. The stigma of the Hammer of Light stained the design, but it remained in service as a line space superiority fighter. Terran pilots hoping to master the Thoth must understand Vasudan fighter doctrine, which leverages Vasudan advantages in energy efficiency to feed a more flexible, hit-and-fade fighting style. Prolonged engagements are death, and superb spatial awareness is a must. Vasudan fighters do not forgive error. The Thoth's production history is far more exclusive than most other Great War era designs, and only names tied to the Sahr Corporation participate in Thoth assembly today. The Asten Thoth is the solitary modern variant."

6904, "17 Meters"

6905, "GVF Serapis"

6906, "The post-Capella era has seen an explosion of Vasudan technological, cultural, and economic power. It often reassures Terran observers to know that the Vasudans are also capable of grand and systematic mistakes. After Operation Templar, Vasudan doctrine called for two lines of new fighters to be deployed. Agile, sophisticated light craft would disrupt and outmaneuver enemy formations, while heavy-hitting assault craft would provide killing power. The Pa-anmu Admiralty championed this doctrine, in part because it would satisfy a wide range of industrial concerns, helping stabilize trade and strengthening the Ambassador to Caravans. The Ambassador would use that strength against the Emperor's military advisors, opening opportunities for Pa-anmu's allies. Designed as an affordably high-tech interceptor and dogfighter to cover roles filled by the Horus and Thoth, the Serapis boasted revolutionary controls and incredible agility. The opportunities for artistic expression were intoxicating, and before anyone could outmaneuver the Pa-anmu Admiralty, the Serapis had become an icon of Vasudan progress and prowess. 

The Serapis sacrificed armor and shielding to hit these design targets, and it quickly became apparent that the rise of anti-fighter beam systems threatened the Serapis mission. The fighter was relabeled an interceptor, a feat of linguistic engineering which Pa-anmu hoped would keep pilots away from warship fire envelopes. But the Serapis lacked the linear speed for that role, and was inevitably deployed as a space superiority fighter. Pilots able to rapidly juggle multiple threats while toggling power systems can win stunning performance from the Serapis, but the craft simply needs more survivability. During the Second Incursion the Serapis produced both a number of aces and a large number of casualties. A hasty retrofit to mount the Maxim cannon allowed the Serapis to serve as an anti-warship skirmisher, giving it a new tactical niche. In some respects the Serapis became the lightest heavy assault fighter ever built. Peacetime production in both corporate and private capacity has filled Vasudan space with Serapis fighters, but many have received survivability packages. The current Imperial Vasudan Navy standard is the Isi-Serapis, but the Medjai has already replaced the Serapis with the next-generation Serekh Taa space dominance fighter, and the IVN has terminated procurement."

6907, "14 Meters"

6908, "GVF Tauret"

6909, "The Tauret is a heavy assault fighter whose wildfire success ended an Admiral's career. When the Pa-anmu doctrine called for one light and one heavy fighter to spearhead the Vasudan fleet, engineers and artisans machinated furiously to win the light fighter design. Inevitably, not everyone made it. Worse yet, the Tauret project was given an insultingly generous line of credit and an Ambassador to facilitate political needs. Since lack of constraint invites excess, and excess is death, the team set out to hobble themselves. First, they decided to build a tribute to the Apsu-Hek, a foul-tempered ambush predator from Vasuda Prime. This popular emblem would keep them humble and alert. Second, they sought out Terran funding and engineering talent to avoid drawing on their baited credit line. Successfully tapping Terran strengths while still producing a uniquely Vasudan design would display adaptability and vigor.

Serious problems with the Tauret's power grid nearly sank the project, but the team rose to the occasion, tapping RNI's experts and incorporating Terran solutions. The team settled on a wide, thin spaceframe with excellent thermal characteristics and trivial shield solutions. The problem of volume was solved, again, with humility, using artistic fold algorithms to efficiently pack systems. 

Although the Tauret does suffer power issues, its reactor feeds six gun mounts, a massive arsenal of missiles, and respectable shields and armor. Initial reactions were negative, in part because the Tauret's design made it extremely frustrating to service. But telemetry from the nebula theater established that the Serapis' whirlwind agility couldn't keep it from the scythe, while Tauret squadrons steamrolled Shivan forces with obdurate ferocity. The team paid off their debts, Admiral Pa-anmu graciously stepped aside to pursue the arts, and the Tauret quietly become the heart of Vasudan air wings.

In modern times the Tauret has been supplemented by the Maa-kheru siege fighter, but it remains a vital strength of the IVN."

6911, "GVF Ptah"

6912, "Akheton's Ptah stealth reconnaissance craft sprang from the same joint product as the Pegasus stealth fighter. Although the hull configuration and stealth systems are divergent, the craft's final performance is comparable to the Pegasus, with superb agility and carefully baffled emanations. The Vasudan design team paid less attention to target profile and visibility than the Pegasus team, preferring to work with a tested configuration, and as a result the Ptah is far easier to maintain and has nearly twice the operational up-time and sortie rate. Ptah missions provided vital data in the Alliance's attack on the first Sathanas juggernaut.

Ptah postings and deployments have become politically controversial since Capella. The IVN and Medjai both maintain Ptah wings, nominally for strategic reconnaissance. Several IVN admirals have been accused of deploying stealth fighters as political instruments. Conversely, whispers suggest the honorable and heroic Medjai use Ptah sorties to eavesdrop and monitor loyalties. 'The Ptahs know' is an idiom suggesting both that a secret has been breached and that the breach may be proper - or improper, depending on the delivery."

6930, "NEM.NOW AESHMA

Shivan assault fighter. Performs in the same niche as the Basilisk, but with reduced effect. This emanation was not present in the Lucifer fleet that destroyed the Ancients, but its presence in the nebula does suggest lineage from the same conflict. Effective only in swarm attacks against light targets. Statistical modeling suggests this emanation is moving towards extinction.

Pilot integration is surprisingly high, given the simplicity of flight behavior. Much of the connectivity appears specialized for signals analysis and mathematical transformation. Possible relic behavior from a past role, perhaps as a Nagari amplifier?

Introns strongly favor chain."

6931, "SB Nephilim"

6932, "NEM.NOW NEPHILIM

Shivan heavy bomber. Heavily shielded and armored warhead bus. Plainly an effect optimum, with limited sophistication and scale. Warship-heavy tactics with limited escort promote Nephilim emanation, as do large groups of lightly defended targets. The design appears to balance payload against chance of successful delivery.

Pilot integration is extreme. We have no hypothesis: perhaps exaptive.

6936, "NEM.NOW NAHEMA

Shivan fighter-bomber and cause of significant consternation. Like the Mara, the Nahema appears to be a traversal design, pushing through a phase space bottleneck into a new array of optimae. Although superficially an effect-sophistication optima, with excellent performance, the Nahema also appeared in tremendous numbers, accounting for a major fraction of Allied casualties during the Second Incursion. We must conclude that it is also promoted by sophistication.

Pilot integration is significant. Nahema pilots are unusually deficient in organs 7F202 and ivHQI.

Introns favor hot swarm, berserker, assassin, standoff, and bruiser."

6937, "SB Seraphim"

6938, "NEM.NOW SERAPHIM

Shivan superheavy bomber. We believe the Seraphim is a scale-effect optimum, with limited sophistication. It employs brute force to steamroll its way to objectives, carrying massive payloads. Heavy warship tactics appear to promote Seraphim emanation, as does the destruction of Shivan capital ships.

Pilot integration is extreme, perhaps due to sensory demands. The design's superficial similarity to the Manticore appears to be confounded by ESM capabilities in the limbs.

Introns favor berserker, assassin, standoff, bruiser, and chain."

6939, "ST Azrael"

6940, "NEM.NOW AZRAEL

Shivan transport. Apparently used to ferry Shivan organisms from point to point, the Azrael is optimized for range and subspace agility, classifying it as a scale-effect optimum. Tactical capabilities favor the hypothesis that the Azrael is not designed to survive resistance. Crew behavior obeys a four-hour cycle with chaotic stalls at the end of certain configuration chains.

Promoters unknown, but we believe bottlenecks in Shivan organism movement promote Azraels. Logs recovered from the NTF Iceni record Azrael transports and their crews behaving cognitively, with highly goal-directed behavior.

6942, "NEM.NOW DIS

Shivan heavy freighter. The Dis displays parturition marks suggesting that it may be a component of a larger device. Apparently built for reliability, the Dis represents a scale optimum, since it could trivially achieve greater speed. Not a tactical factor, but a major strategic target.

Dis appear to be promoted by successful logistics, by Shivan assets short on logistics, and by an excess of Mephisto and Asmodeus population. Crew cycle period unknown. During operations around the Knossos portal, Dis freighters displayed evasive behavior.

Ship ecosystem displays disproportionate diversity. System violence spikes from one to six standard deviations, with hangovers after five+ spikes and a three percent chance of a novel configuration. Feed-forward depends on survival rates.

Introns include scalar, armored, and chain."

6943, "SFr Mephisto"

Extremely irritating Shivan light freighter. Displays unconventional morphology for a Shivan specimen. A scale optimum with a slight tendency towards effect, the Mephisto has enough self-defense capability to make a marginal difference in survivability. Pilots report that the craft's cargo provides accidental armor.

Mephisto crews do not obey a consistent behavioral cycle, suggesting the population may somehow be too small to achieve statistical power. Emanation is promoted by attacks on Shivan logistics. Onboard ecosystem violence follows a sine wave with a thirty-minute period. Novel configurations are observed on alternate cycles. Feed-forward has not been observed.

Introns include scrambler, judas, picket, chain, and blink."

6945, "SFr Asmodeus"

6946, "NEM.NOW ASMODEUS

Shivan tactical freighter. Displays the most armor and defensive systems of any Shivan freighter yet encountered, and carries cargo in hardened containers. Apparently an effect optimum in response to threat environments. Significant attrition on Shivan logistics causes emanation of Asmodeus freighters, suggesting procurement is consequential, perhaps due to marginal losses in efficiency.

Asmodeus crews obey a boom-bust behavioral cycle without clear period. There are some mathematical relationships to 1/f noise in neural networks. Booms are characterized by enhanced teleology, transitioning via anaphase and bilateral conflict into a bust period of stereotypic activity along two primary configurations. Novel configurations do not arise in the bust period.

Introns include scrambler, picket, chain, and armor."

6947, "SC Lilith"

6948, "NEM.NOW LILITH

Shivan heavy cruiser and cause of significant consternation. A heavily armored Cain variant, it was a major threat during the Great War and escalated to nightmare during the Second Incursion, where it manifested with a destroyer-grade beam system operating at full power and rate of fire. Adequately defended against strike craft, the Lilith represents an effect-sophistication optimum, although some argue it must be treated as an anomaly or a bottleneck traversal. There is no statistical signal behind Lilith emanations, bolstering the suggestion that it is a form of accident or traversal.

It is possible that the Lilith includes a subspace heat sink akin to the Sathanas main weapons.

Lilith crews obey a strikingly different behavioral cycle than Cain crews, anaphasing into smaller and smaller behavioral groups until all groups but one are extinct. This behavior population repeats the cycle. Each observed vessel has its own characteristic cycle. Hull space diversity is lower than the Cain's, with prominent outgassing from a nanostrain that converts hull isomers.

Introns include berserker, sleeper, scalar, and assassin."

6949, "SC Rakshasa"

6950, "NEM.NOW RAKSHASA

Shivan strike cruiser. Like many Shivan designs it appears to be a high-alpha beam attacker, but it exhibits an asymmetrical aberration, suggesting either a scale optimization or a missense mutation. Armed with three cruiser-grade beam weapons, the Rakshasa is a significant threat to Allied warships, but as a scale-effect optimum it can be countered with conventional tactics. Pilots should disable the three forward beam weapons with guided missiles as soon as possible. Primary gunfire is ineffective, since the exposed beam emitters are unusually small.

No data on Rakshasa crew behavior is available. Although plenty of ESM information was collected during operations in the nebula, including hull-penetrating scans, only surface exofauna are available for study. Statistical analysis of crew behavior curdles when attempting to bootstrap models of behavioral complexity unless out-of-possibility-space axioms are assumed. Surface exofauna display no particular traits of interest, as the Rakshasa appears inhabited by a conventional Shivan ecosystem of crawlers, killers, anodes, and sparkers.

Introns include berserker, picket, sleeper, armor, scalar, twin, and chain."

6951, "SC Cain"

6952, "NEM.NOW CAIN

Shivan light cruiser. A Great War-era cruiser that manifested during the Second Incursion with a single cruiser-grade beam weapon, the Cain represents a baseline for Shivan tactical capabilities. Missile launchers and a CIWS beam make the Cain a respectable threat to fighter attack, but it is clearly a scale optimization for environments that reward the presence of multiple light warships. Promoters include large numbers of small Allied warships or small numbers of large Allied warships.

Cain crews cycle through an erratic series of behavioral epochs that appear statistically similar to the dynamics of an eight-body system. Ecosystem violence correlates in an exact negative relationship. Most Cains host a macroorganism of indeterminate origin and considerable size which moves erratically through a space forward of the ship's stern. Feed-forward always occurs, but in almost all cases it is statistically neutral across multiple epochs. Cain crews thus violate historical contingency. 

Introns include berserker, picket, sleeper, armor, scalar, twin, assassin, and chain."

6953, "SD Demon"

6954, "NEM.NOW DEMON

Shivan line destroyer. Between the Great War and the Second Incursion the type accreted a massive defensive advantage, making it an extremely difficult target to kill. The Demon is lightly gunned for its size, identifying it as a probable scale-effect optimum, with little concern for sophistication. The Demon has excellent hangar facilities. Promoters include Allied corvette-size warships, the destruction of Shivan warships, and a shortage of support for Shivan strike craft. The Demon appears to be suited to environments in which the enemy has numbers but limited firepower.

GTVI is concerned that the Demon is continuing to optimize. Although teleonomic analysis suggests the design is very old, it has recently undergone a transition, and the transition may continue until the destroyer develops a better-defended engine system and enhanced point defenses. The Demon may mature into an 'escort destroyer' with area control capabilities, particularly if the type's missile launchers acquire expanded capability.

Demon crew behavior is subdivided into two primary regions, although these are purely statistical, not spatial. Regions interact only during subspace jumps. After an interaction, shocks disseminate through both regions, priming a set of games that play themselves forward in loosely superConway configurations. In one case a Demon was observed post-jump with only a single observable region, but the observation crew retired due to unease before further data could be collected.

The Demon's internal ecosystem revolves around a set of exotic-atmosphere particle accelerators and cyclotrons. These devices accelerate charged particles to relativistic velocities in fields as powerful as a star's. Near the aft of the cyclotron configuration, six erratic mass objects exchange arcs of charge in a power series. The Shivan organisms termed hulks, melts, plates, and spirals exist in relationship to this environment, although spirals sometimes penetrate as far as the outer hull.

Introns include berserker, standoff, picket, sleeper, armor, and scalar."

6955, "SD Ravana"

6956, "NEM.NOW RAVANA

Shivan strike destroyer. The Ravana is a shock attacker that ambushes targets with its startling subspace agility. Once its drives are exhausted, it can be pinned down and prosecuted in real space. Heavily armed with beam weapons, the Ravana neglects anti-fighter defenses or any real staying power, classifying it as a scale-sophistication optimum, putting technique above broad effect. The Ravana's promoters include the presence of Allied light warships, or heavier warships in isolated positions. As a hit-and-run assassin, the Ravana is a critical threat to Allied morale and force cohesion.

Ravana tactics offered an enormous challenge to the Alliance during the Second Incursion, and perhaps more than any other warship except the Sathanas, it has influenced Alliance doctrine in the years since.

The most notable trait of the Ravana's ecosystem is an intermittent local subspace gate in the ship's core. This appears to be a vestigial or prototypical form of the Sathanas' subspace weapon, and it may have unusual tactical effects, as displayed by the SD Vassago in Capella. A vortex of six to eight hundred flat morphs move in proximity to the gate, forming a turbine or cycloid structure. Population collapses occur on a probabilistic basis, scaling with time since last gate activity and repopulating after a gate event. Crew behavior cycles off this seed function.

Introns include berserker, sleeper, scalar, twin, blink, scrambler, and assassin."

6957, "SD Lucifer"

6958, "NEM.NOW LUCIFER

Shivan planetkiller. The Lucifer is the Great War incarnate, an invincible planet-burning nemesis that defined the Shivan threat for an entire generation. Equipped with a sheath shield, two anti-warship beams, and two dual-mode anti-ship/anti-population beams, the Lucifer posed an intractable challenge to Great War tactics and technology. The type is clearly an effect-sophistication optimum, with no concern for scale. Its promoters are unknown, but we suspect that the Lucifer is a heuristic response to a civilization with a highly developed pre-subspace infrastructure, including extensive use of kinetic kill vehicles. Alternately, the Lucifer may not be a product of Shivan response heuristics at all.

The centrality of the Lucifer to Shivan behavior in the Great War led Allied analysts down a blind path, and until the Second Incursion, Allied doctrine prized the ability to engage and destroy a single massive Shivan capital ship.

Recent encounters with a Lucifer-type combatant in unconventional circumstances have highlighted the mutability and power of the Shivan threat. This specimen displayed enhanced power generation, allowing it to operate all its main weapons simultaneously. Startling subspace agility permitted the specimen to engage and disengage with Allied forces in a series of harrying attacks. Analysts believe this Lucifer recognized that it was outmatched and intentionally deactivated its sheath shield in order to pursue a strategy of attritional engagement, exploiting its superior self-repair ability.

It is likely that these behaviors represent cognitive adaptation.

During Allied operations in the nebula, scout wings tracked a Rahu gas miner that jumped from depot to depot, extracting Trident platforms from the nebula and caching them in small 'urchin' formations. The purpose of this behavior is unknown.

The Trident possesses a sophisticated onboard intelligence, but it is only vestigially connected to the actual operating mechanism. It appears to be exaptive.

If the primary weapons of Shivan craft ever begin expressing more power and accuracy, Allied pilots will face a major threat.

Belial sentry guns were the object of a minor conspiracy within GTVI during the Second Incursion. Analysis of ESM records detected a pattern in the bearing and intensity of Belial targeting sensors, as if the Shivans were using them as communication buoys. A scramble to collect and examine Belial specimens led to the loss of a combat squadron at the hands of a Dragon emanation. Later teleonomic analysis of these transmissions inferred information content, but it matches no known Shivan emission.

Shivan gas miner. Heavily armored for a non-combat spacecraft, the Rahu gathers and processes nebula gas for use in Shivan drive systems. Rahu types explode spectacularly when destroyed, so combat pilots should use caution. Promoters include Shivan combat operations and Shivan logistical deficits.

Our models suggest that the Rahu should be lightly armored, as a scale optimum. The design may be pre-adapted as a result of past pressure on Shivan mining operations in the nebula.

Rahu crew behavior is an example of outright physical violence among Shivan organisms. The crew selects target members, who are attacked, dismembered, and integrated with components from other dismembered targets. After a convalescence period, the resulting novel phenotypes return to default crew behavior. A small fraction of crew organisms are repeatedly targeted, creating chimeric specimens with multiple limbs and convulsive, maladaptive mass. Target selection seems to crawl along a Markov-like similarity selection from past targets.

Onboard ecosystem diversity typically includes a colony of melters and spirals arranged along field lines in the fractionation array. These organisms are hunted by small predator morphs called jointers, which induce fatal communication by linking two prey organisms.

Shivan corvette. Very lightly armed for a ship-to-ship combatant, the Moloch behaves like a pocket destroyer, launching Shivan strike craft against Allied objectives. This makes it a limited battlefield presence on its own, but a major strategic nuisance. We designate the Moloch as a scale-sophistication optimum, placing agility above simple tactical effect. Promoters include Allied force concentrations, Allied convoy and fighter operations, and the presence of light Allied warships.

The Moloch is armed with three cruiser-grade antiship beams, a strong anti-fighter suite, and compartmentalized hull design that requires major firepower to kill. It has an excellent subspace drive even by Shivan standards, operating with accuracy and alacrity even close to disruptive presences like the Knossos portal. The warship's forward gun is a conventional plasma weapon, but it possesses a bottle control apparatus like a beam weapon, suggesting either a missense mutation or the development of a novel guided plasma weapon.

Crew behavior obeys the Kaleo-Mikala law, with total feed forward and historical contingency. Stable configurations orbit a behavioral attractor which we tentatively attribute to one of two large sessile masses inhabiting spaces along the ship's spine. Generations occur at thirty-minute intervals, with crossover between configurations provided by outbursts of symbolic violence. Generation turnover is complete and instantaneous. The broad trend of behavioral configurations represents an approach-and-flee cycle.

6973, "SJ Sathanas"

6974, "NEM.NOW SATHANAS

Shivan juggernaut and special weapon platform. The apocalyptic messenger of the Second Incursion, the Sathanas was believed to be the single command platform coordinating Shivan behavior in the nebula - until more than eighty Sathanas juggernauts converged on Allied space, where they collapsed the Capella star with a subspace weapon, triggering an artificial supernova. This punctured a number of assumptions about Shivan behavior and strategic organization, marking a significant turning point in both Allied doctrine and human-Vasudan history.

The Sathanas' primary tactical armament is a quartet of forward-mounted superheavy beams that violate local thermodynamics. These weapons can mission kill an Allied destroyer in a single salvo. We believe the Sathanas sinks heat directly into a subspace domain. The Sathanas is heavily armored and defended from fighter attack by hull defenses and an air wing.

Frighteningly, we believe the Sathanas represents a scale-sophistication optimum. A juggernaut optimized for battlefield effect would have superior weapons coverage and a more diversified armament. Instead, the Sathanas appears to be a shock platform, adapted to penetrate blockades, ambush vital targets, and deploy its main weapon.

The Sathanas' strategic capability lies in its powerful subspace weapon. Fired through the same emitters as the beam weapons, this weapon engineers the subspace domain to variable effect. Imputed capabilities include node engineering, jump capture, and, when used in concert with other Sathanas juggernauts, the forced supernova of stars.

We have no information on Sathanas promoters or introns. The craft is clearly pre-adapted, but it may represent a Shivan strategic asset, responsive not to a particular threat species but to broader life cycle requirements. Sathanas behavior during the late Second Incursion was highly goal-directed and intentional.

The craft's internal ecosystem is cause for major alarm. The Sathanas' interior volume hosts an environment nicknamed the 'nightmare turbine', which appears to be coupled both to the juggernaut's tactical capabilities and to Shivan strategic behavior. Within this environment, structures ranging from the quantum level up through macrofauna and semiotic or conceptual realms engaged in destructive competition, producing lethally optimized variants and symbols. The system was highly energetic, with input from the Sathanas' primary power. Output seemed to serve as a seed function or driver for Shivan behavior.

The ability to engage and destroy Sathanas juggernauts in large numbers is a primary goal of Allied doctrine."

An arsenal of beam weapons provides the class with significant firepower, but as with the Sathanas, its primary capabilities presumably lie beyond its overwhelming throw weight. Analysis of ESM readings from the Kalki is underway, which may provide insight into the type's role in the Shivan behavioral algorithm."

Generalist space superiority and reconnaissance fighter. Optimized for scale effect, where maneuverability grants advantage. Promoters include soft targets and enemy generalist craft.
The Scorpion is most interesting from the teleonomic perspective, as it would appear to be extremely basal, seemingly ancestral to the Dragon, Shaitan and Nephilim types, which it shares configuration of sensors, extreme level of pilot integration and drive train configuration. This would suggest origins in extremely old behavioral eras.
All known Shivan fighter introns have been observed in Scorpion specimens, with particularly high rates of banshee, cold swarm, chain, berserker and assassin. "

6989, "SF Dragon"

6990, "NEM.NOW DRAGON

Shivan elite agility fighter. Engages Allied strike craft using radical maneuvers across multiple degrees of freedom, to fearsome effect. Lightly armed and ineffective against larger craft. We hypothesize the Dragon emerges from a response heuristic favoring sophistication and local effect, without concern for difficulty of procurement. Because the Dragon is rarely encountered, we suspect it is somehow costly or consequential to procure. We believe that Allied tactics focused on groups of effective strike craft will cause Dragon emanation.

Pilot organism integration is nearly total. Distinctions are arbitrary.

Introns suggest that groups of Dragons may develop a number of swarm behaviors, including enhanced individual capability as swarm size degrades, i.e. hot swarm, or reduced individual capability as swarm size degrades, i.e. cold swarm. The berserker intron is not commonly encountered in Dragon specimens. Assassin introns may be present but results are inconclusive."

Shivan heavy assault fighter. Limited agility and heavy shielding. Sensor layout and armament suggest an effect-scale optimum favoring attacks against lightly defended targets, with little consideration for self-defense against other fighters. The Basilisk appears to be a behavior for applying maximal force to vulnerable gaps. Tactics that favor point assets, without escort or disruption to break up incoming wings, will promote Basilisk emanation.

Pilot integration is limited, suggesting minimal throughput required to optimize performance. All specimens have excellent range and endurance.

Introns suggest Basilisks could manifest heavier warheads, standoff attack capabilities, or cold swarm behavior. Some specimens imply stealth or camouflage introns."

Clearly an optimum favoring environments in which linear speed permits situation control, agility is an adequate defense, and numbers help swamp enemy processing. Standoff tactics and heavier strike craft promote Manticore emanation, as do modes of attack with long run-up.

Pilot integration is limited, suggesting that the organism's onboard reaction time and processing is adequate to the task.

Introns favor hot swarm, cold swarm, berserker, and assassin. No standoff or bruiser introns detected. Scrambler, judas, and chain introns are present but not highly selected for."

6995, "SF Mara"

6996, "NEM.NOW MARA

Shivan space superiority fighter. A strikingly balanced optimum between scale, effect, and sophistication in environments where pure maneuver is an asymmetrical advantage. Teleonomic analysis of the Mara design dates it to an era of behaviors fairly late in the projected conflict with the Ancients, so it is perhaps no surprise that the design seems pre-adapted. We have much better data on the Mara than most other design emanations, which makes it a point of enhanced investigation.

The Mara appears to be promoted by enemy tactical sophistication. Its flexibility allows it to perform in the space superiority, escort, and heavy assault roles. We are concerned that the design may represent a bottleneck bypass into a new set of optimae. Pilot integration is moderate.

Introns are extremely diverse, suggesting long lineage. Hot swarm, berserker, banshee, and standoff appear most probable."

6998, "NEM.NOW ASTAROTH

Shivan space superiority and intercept fighter. Agile but frail, the Astaroth depends on its slim target profile and confusing behavior. We believe the Astaroth represents a scale optimum in environments where noise and disorientation produce effect. Promotion factors are unclear, although we suspect the same factors that drive Manticore manifestation may operate. The curious possibility exists that the Astaroth also represents a kind of meta-noise, jamming attempts to infer Shivan procurement and deployment behavior.

Pilot integration is extreme.

Introns favor cold swarm behavior, with very limited hot swarm presence."

Yet our own coexistence with the Vasudans, and our knowledge of the extent of Ancient xenocide, summons a powerful mystery. Technologically sophisticated life is apparently common in the galaxy - it arises frequently, and it has done so for some time now, at least in the cosmological span. Why, then, is the galaxy empty - Why do we find no von Neumann probes propagating through the subspace network? Where is the life that must have come before us?

We should inhabit a teeming universe, a bazaar of wonders, a cosmic ecumenopolis overflowing with civilization. The stars and galaxies around us should by all rights have been restructured to the needs of unimaginably sophisticated engineers. Technology self-catalyzes, and that catalysis has had time to flourish. The civilizations of the universe should, by now, have conquered reality itself.

We find no such wonder. Our cosmos is silent.

Certainly the Shivans provide one answer to this question - a great filter that annihilates spacefaring civilizations. But what if there was a time before the Shivans? What happened to the first life in the universe, the children of the dawn?

Did they pass on to some unglimpsable destiny, leaving no wreckage or monument? Or do we inhabit their tomb - a quarantine zone, a carcass, malignant with some ancient mistake?"

Heavy armour and a devastating frontal array of cannons makes the Uriel the premier weapons platform against large, slow-moving targets. Uriels excel in various mission profiles ranging from airstrikes on ground targets to full-scale assaults against cruiser assets to heavy fighter or turret suppression. The fighter is also equipped with an underslung heavy long-range gauss cannon, further increasing its weapons potential. The low manoeuverability and top speed of the Uriel limits its effectiveness in dogfights, but this is somewhat offset by the fighter's dorsal turret. When deployed in full squadron strength, Uriels can dominate an entire battlespace with Slammer fire. The GTVA has faced down the threat of the Uriel by simply destroying as many as possible through massed Trebuchet fire, and unfortunately for the Federation, the Uriel is growing scarce to the point where it can only be deployed in vital situations."

Strangely, although all signs suggest the Ainsarii has entered limited production, none have yet been deployed to combat units on even a trial basis."

As a weapons platform, it is more than capable of dispatching ships approaching destroyer-class specifications. The Durga is the hammer blow when negotiation has failed, and the complete destruction of the enemy is the only option. The Federation possesses extraordinarily small numbers of Durga bombers, and they are being held in strategic reserve until the war enters a critical phase. The presence of Durga bombers near Earth and Mars has single-handedly prevented the GTVA from launching an overwhelming warship attack."

7048, "The UEB Lapith was introduced in the later stages of the civil war in Sol in response to increasing casualties among Durga and Vajradhara squadrons. The GTVA's response to a UEF bomber deployment was to send in Trebuchet-armed hunter-killers to saturate the battlespace with bomber-killing ordnance. This tactic was so effective that it would soon nullify any remaining anti-capital ship advantage the UEF possessed. The Lapith is a fast Jackhammer and Sledgehammer delivery platform designed to jump in, deliver her payload and exfiltrate to safety in the minimum amount of time. The improved profile and speed of what is essentially an oversized fighter has increased the survival rates of UEF bomber pilots fourfold since deployment."

Several Oculus prototypes escaped. The Oculus mounts incredibly powerful sensors and ESM gear, granting it a number of novel tactical abilities. In addition to excellent tracking of incoming, outgoing, and proximate subspace traffic, the Oculus can intercept, decrypt, and even forge secure transmissions. Most critically, it can sometimes jam GTVA direct-fire beam weapon targetting, allowing nearby ships critical time to engage and nullifying one of the GTVA's main advantages."

7052, "UEFg Murugan"

7053, "The Murugan was a class of warship designed for the Federation Navy. 

The Federation fleet had a powerful defensive core in the Solaris flagships but was brittle on the offensive. In 2376 Admiral Calder's Jovian Rim Fleet had routed the Gaian Effort in the decisive Battle of Eris Base, ending a protacted and costly campaign against the militant organisation. However, the conflict had exposed shortcomings of Navy assets, specifically the undergunned and underarmoured Purusha light frigate and the modern but fragile Karuna frigate carrier. A paradigm shift in warship design was called for by the Admiralty and several proposals for a next-generation warship were considered.

Admiral Calder's concept was as bulldog as the man himself. He envisioned a dreadnought suited to his aggressive, unsubtle practice of warfare. The ship's dimensions would approach destroyer-scale, but the ship would forgo a fighter hangar for increased armour. The Murugan sported a bruising main battery of frigate-scale mass drivers in four triple-barreled turrets. Long range strike capability came in the form of a pair of spinal gauss cannons. A suite of point defense turrets provided antifighter fire and warhead interception. The Murugan was a brute of a ship, all muscle, built to brawl against cruisers and prevail.

Fresh from victory over the Gefs, Calder utilised his considerable clout to push for the allocation of resources towards the Murugan. Construction of a prototype vessel was commenced at the Bradbury Fleetyards, but was halted barely two months into construction when computer simulations identified problems with the ship's combat effectiveness. The ship was essentially undergunned for her size and role, and the design was revisited and refined. The ship's primary battery was doubled, supplemented by a new secondary battery of cruiser-grade mass drivers. Four torpedo launchers were installed, each capable of firing a swarm of Apocalypse antimatter missiles. Finally, the point defense suite was enhanced with several flak turrets. The firepower of the refit design would come close to exceeding that of the Solaris-class destroyers.

At this stage the budget had blown out to five times the initial estimate and construction was considerably behind schedule. It would be years before the first Murugan would roll out of the yards and Third Fleet needed to replenish its losses from the campaign against the Gefs. The Murugan project was put on indefinite hold, and resources would instead be directed towards the Narayana heavy frigate."

The problem you know is the budget black hole - resources go in, nothing gets out. Where is it all going? We're funding paper crews, ships that don't exist. Entire frig- and crurons disappearing from FLEETNET. I asked for tracking help but MIDWINTER hasn't got back to me. I don't even know where she's based nowadays.

So I told you I followed the paper trail of Calder's white elephant all the way to Saab. Everything was legit. Saab shipyard recieved the Murugan hull and towed her away to Elis for scrap. After that it all gets fuzzy. Anyone who gets to Elis graveyard looking for answers gets turned away at the door. I don't think the admiral even knows what happened to his pet project.

So I went digging. I can't find anything on BULWARK, so does that rule out Fleet involvement? There must be someone here who knows what the fuck is going on. Cross referenced with FEDAYEEN but nothing came up. DARK CLOUD seems superficially involved but there's nothing specific anywhere.  Maybe an offshoot Shivan project? Doesn't sound right though, they've never been interested in military resources.

And the headache is, this black hole needed a half-built battleship for some reason. It's gotta be destroyer-scale. Any smaller and they'd just dig up one of the FL hulls in storage. No one's going to miss an old frigate.

FROM: Capt. Bryn O'Keefe, CO, GTCv Chanticleer

For those of you who are new to the GTCv $f Chanticleer, welcome aboard. We will be based from $f Artemis $f Station, in Europa orbit.  This is going to be very, very different from being on $h Shivan watch in $f Vega. Pilots, $p Commander $p Tompkins, squadron leader of the $p 52nd $p Nomads, will brief you.

The strategic situation has deteriorated significantly.  Two days ago, $f{ Neptune Headquarters $} fell to a $h{ United Earth Federation $} assault. The battlegroup of the GTD $f Carthage was lost entirely. In response, the Security Council has authorized Admiral $f Steele to use all available force to bring the war to its conclusion.  The GTD $f Phoenicia and GTD $f Vengeance have been deployed to Jupiter.  The GTD $f Implacable and GTD $f Agamemnon are en route.  We now approach the critical point in this war, and the $f GTVA expects that everyone will do their duty."

FROM: Commander Hannah Tompkins, CO 52nd Nomads

Ned -
Glad to have you join as my executive officer, though I wish it were under better circumstances.  I know you lost a lot of friends on the $f Carthage, and I'm sorry.  The $f 52nd is a good squadron - you'll be leading $f Alpha wing, flying with $p Lara $p Silverman and $p John $p O'Connor.  It's a pretty tight-knit group.  The $f Chanticleer isn't a big ship, so everybody knows everybody. I've forwarded the ship and squadron profile, so you have it at the top of your inbox.

You already read the briefing memo from the captain, right?  Whatever Admiral $f Steele has planned, it's in Big Op territory. We're going from three destroyers in Sol to seven. The man wants to end the war here and now.  I say, good for him.  Time to take the gloves off.
- Hannah"

SQUADRON PROFILE: 52ND NOMADS

Composite squadron assigned to aviation corvette GTCv $f Chanticleer.  Duties include space superiority, intercept, and light strike.  Currently authorized to fly GTF $f Aurora heavy reconnaissance fighters, GTB $f Artemis strike bombers, and GTF $f Perseus interceptors.  Commanding officer is Cmdr. $p Hannah $p Tompkins."

7384, "MESSAGE 4
SHIP PROFILE: GTCv CHANTICLEER

The $f Chanticleer is a $f Diomedes-class corvette armed with four Bull Frost next-generation anti-warship beams in a pair of twinned lateral batteries.  The Diomedes-class relies on its startling agility to bring its firepower to bear. Designed to engage targets abeam, the class rewards flanking tactics and circling engagements against larger hostiles and aggressive action against multiple lighter opponents. Considerable sacrifices were made to operationalize the ship's fighterbay, but the potency of an on-board interceptor or bomber unit justified the cost, particularly in the areas of point defense and counter-air."

7385, "Good evening, pilots. This is Commander $p Hannah $p Tompkins, your squadron leader.  At 2200 hours, a $h Federation task force led by the frigate $h Rajput mounted an artillery attack on a logistics convoy transiting the Sol-Delta Serpentis node.  Our hunter-killer corvettes forced the Feds to withdraw, but not before the Feds destroyed the GTCv $f Shima and crippled the GTL $f Locust.  During the battle, $f Intelligence was able to hack their communications, allowing us to vector their location to a position well above the ecliptic.  As a result, your fighters might pick up some of their comms traffic as well."

7400, "Enemy fighters"

7401, "Excellent job, Ned. The Rajput has been nullified, removing one more Fed artillery asset from the board. Almost as important, we shot down a squadron's worth of Fed fighters. Those pilots are irreplaceable. 

Get a good night's sleep - you've earned it. Captain O'Keefe says we're going to be launching a lot more sorties over the next couple weeks.  I'm not privy to the details, but probably it's related to Admiral Steele's upcoming Mars offensive.  It's great to be flying with you again, old man."

7402, "Your quick thinking saved both gunboats even after the misjump. There are a thousand officers and crew on the Beaufort and the Firefly that owe you their lives."

7403, "It's a shame we lost both gunboats, but I'm not sure what we could have done better. When we jumped in we were sitting ducks for UEF torpedoes."

7404, "The VLS torpedo launchers on the Rajput are the largest threat to the gunboats. Take them down with Maxim and Trebuchet fire, and don't forget to use Gamma wing."

7405, "It's a shame we lost the Firefly, but I'm not sure what we could have done better. When we jumped in we were sitting ducks for UEF torpedoes."

7406, "It's a shame we lost the Beaufort, but I'm not sure what we could have done better. When we jumped in we were sitting ducks for UEF torpedoes."

7407, "Good job taking down both Fed cruisers. Every escort we neutralize here is a ship that we won't have to face over Earth or Mars."

7408, "We got shredded out there. The Chanticleer was lost to UEF forces, and the remnants of the 52nd are being transferred to the 8th Fleet in Regulus for rebuilding.  We're going to be out of the war for a while while we rebuild."

7409, "Prioritize warhead intercept. When the Federation bombers jump in, make them your top priority."

7410, "The Rajput escaped. We missed a golden opportunity to knock out a major UEF artillery asset. I know our jump coordinates were bad, but we needed to do better."

7520, "Captain O'Keefe is furious with Command for sending us in with such bad intelligence.  We had no idea this was a White Guard base, and there are a lot of empty chairs in this wardroom because of it. Your wing acquitted itself well, Ned, but this was a mission for SOC spooks. You're lucky to be alive. We captured the base and the bombers, but I'm not sure the cost was worth it.  

We're being pulled off the front lines for now.  Admiral Steele has ordered us to rendezvous with the logistics ship GTL Hastings for repairs and replenishment. I, for one, am looking forward to it. We've taken casualties to our air wing, the Chanticleer's subspace drive is still damaged from Federation torpedo hits, and the atmosphere of Venus played hell with our fighters' engines."

FROM: Captain Bryn O'Keefe, CO, GTCv Chanticleer

I hope you've enjoyed your week of R&R. The GTL $f Hastings has done a wonderful job getting us back in fighting trim.  I've gotten our orders from Command: we will be deploying our air wing to support Admiral $f Steele's knockout punch against the $h United $h Earth $h Federation. At 0230 today, the GTD $f Atreus and GTD $f Imperieuse launched the initial strike waves towards Mars.  

Keep your eyes on the prize, people.  When we win here, it means returning home and reunifying our species.  There is no alternative, ladies and gentlemen.  It's a scary universe out there. As an ancient writer once said, $quoteWe must all hang together, or we surely will hang separately.$quote

Ned, I'm going to send you this message privately, because you're a good pilot and an old friend.  I saw you sarcastically quoting $p All $p Quiet $p on $p the $p Western $p Front after the $p Venus debriefing.  You can't do stuff like that, old man. No more acting like a smart-mouthed plebe.

I know you're exhausted, Ned.  So am I.  We've both seen far too many friends die.  But we have a unit to run.  If our newbies are going to survive to see the blue skies of $h Earth, they need our support.

You can do this, Ned.

7861, "Superb work out there, Ned.  You were put into a difficult situation and came out with flying colors.  The Fed fighters outnumbered you two to one, and the AWACS jamming turned our Mjolnir cannons into expensive paperweights. Those old cruisers were useless even in a static defensive position.  Colonel Abner, the station commander, is hopping mad that Command provided her such an inadequate force.  

For the record, I agree with her. We came very close to losing an important strategic asset because Command put too much faith in remote beam cannons.  Command has deployed an additional two gunboats, and hopefully that'll be enough.

Construction on the Utopia dockyard should be completed soon.  This will give us another strong forward base to use against the Earth and Luna defenses.  The Feds seem to be saving their remaining fleet units for one last push, so we'll need all the logistical capacity we can get.  

On another note, apparently O'Connor talked Silverman into going bar hopping on Artemis Station.  He's going to wear that white leather jacket tomorrow night, and boy, is he proud of it.  Yep, it's THAT jacket. The one that allegedly makes him irresistible to Earth girls."

Colonel Abner, the station commander, is hopping mad that Command provided her such an inadequate force.  For the record, I think she's got a point. With a couple modern gunboats, the dockyard might still be intact.

Losing the dock will keep us from using Utopia Station as a logistical hub. The Feds seem to be saving their remaining fleet units for one last push, and we'll need all the logistical capacity we can get. Don't be hard on yourself, though.  They had us beat from the start.

You missed a really great night out with me and $p Silverman, boss.  She met a handsome, funny Martian lawyer and they spent all night making eyes at each other.

While we were out on this mission, the Federation Elders issued another one of their statements, that Earth will hold out even if Mars has given up, that enlightenment is within reach, yada yada yada.

Three hours ago, the $h Federation launched an all-out assault on our positions across the $p Sol system, committing nearly all their remaining capital ships and fighter squadrons. Full-scale battles are currently ongoing at $p Earth, $p Mars, $p Luna, $p Ganymede, and the $p Delta $p Serpentis $p jump $p node.  The enemy has achieved a breakthrough at the node.

We have lost all contact with $f Fleet $f Command in $p Delta $p Serpentis.  Long-range sensors indicate the jump node is collapsing.

8139, "We've mounted bomber strikes on the artillery frigates, but both are still standing.  Jamming from the $h AWACS is preventing us from achieving target lock with our heavy beam cannons, so we're limited to using our light slash beams. "

8140, "$f Alpha and $f Beta wings, you'll deploy first and clear the escort fighters.  Once the fighters are destroyed, Alpha will provide jump telemetry to the $f Chanticleer and the rest of the air wing."

8141, "$f Gamma and $f Delta's bombers will jump in and target the AWACS while the $f Chanticleer and the $f Zagreus engage the artillery frigate $h Decatur.  I'll be in Gamma 1.  Alpha and Beta, you'll escort us."

8143, "After the AWACS and the artillery are destroyed, Gamma and Delta will withdraw. The GTD $f Atreus will shock jump in and clear the area of any remaining warships.  Alpha and Beta, the Atreus won't have time to deploy fighters, so you'll provide fighter cover."

8145, "This is the war, right here.  Intelligence estimates that most of the remaining Fed capital ships are deployed to defend the $h Maitreya, and they will fight to the bitter end to cover it.  We must force the Maitreya to shut down its subspace weapon, or else we're going to be stranded in $p Sol, possibly forever."

8146, "We did well out there, Ned.  All in all, we took down two entire frigate squadrons and a couple squadrons of fighters, none of which the Feds can replace.  Even if the Maitreya got away, that's a win in my book.  Admiral Steele is calling it a decisive victory, as big as the Battle of Saturn.  I know you hate the comparison, because your old ship had to serve as bait at Saturn.

With the Maitreya jumping away, the jump node has begun to re-stabilize.  Command says that we won't be able to traverse the node for weeks, but we've reestablished fragmentary communications with the rest of the GTVA.  For now, we're still stuck in Sol.

Fleetnet is currently buzzing that the Federation Elders have requested a ceasefire.  Command will neither confirm nor deny whether that's the case.  If and when there is a ceasefire, I will share that bottle of Vannacken '53 with the squadron."

8147, "The war is over, and not in the way we expected.  

The Maitreya has sealed the node, and there's nothing we can do to reopen it, except by the good graces of the Federation Elders.  We have overwhelming firepower, and no way of resupplying our forces.  We're cut off, and our options are to surrender or starve.

Admiral Steele has reached out to the Federation Elders."

FROM: Capt. Bryn O'Keefe, CO, GTCv Chanticleer
 
To the officers and crew of the GTCv Chanticleer:

The rumors are true.  The Federation $h Elders have requested a ceasefire, and Admiral $f Steele has granted it.  The Federation Navy has been eliminated as a coherent fighting force.  Many units are still unaccounted for, including the UED $h Eris and the $h Maitreya, but they can offer no meaningful resistance.

By your devotion to the $f GTVA, and your superlative fighting, we have brought our homeworld back into the human family.  We once again stand united against the $h Shivans and anything else that threatens our survival as a species. To secure these triumphs, hundreds of thousands of our comrades have sacrificed their lives.  Every Earther who sets foot on the colonies, and every colonist who sets foot on Earth, is a living tribute to those sacrifices."

8247, "Pilots, you heard Captain $p O'Keefe.  The war is over, and all we have to do is wait for the $f Admiral to talk it out with the $h Elders.  $f Command has ordered the $f Chanticleer to $p Neptune to assume control over $p Neptune $p HQ.  Ned, you and $f Alpha wing will scan the installation and all vessels present there to verify their disarmament.  I'll lead $f Gamma wing, flying close escort over the $f Chanticleer."

8248, "UEF Ships"

8249, "Neptune"

8250, "Once everything is scanned, $f Omega wing's transports will jump in and assume control of the installation.

Rules of engagement are weapons tight, pilots.  Let's do this by the book.  These $p Feds have surrendered and they're our brothers now.  

What's that, Mr. $p O'Connor?  Yes, Lieutenant, after we land, I will share that bottle of Vannacken '53 with the squadron."

8251, "Omega"

8252, "Ned - you're OK to fly here, right?  Being back at $p Neptune and everything - I know it's hard for you.

You're good to go?  OK.  Just making sure, old man.  "

8253, "You may warp out at any time during this mission by pressing $p Alt-J."

8254, "I'm a little stunned that the war really is over.  After three long, brutal years, the Feds have finally yielded.  Thank God.  I signed up to defend Humanity against the Shivans, not to kill our kin back home.  

It'll still be a good month or two before the node to Delta Serpentis stabilizes, so Admiral Steele has agreed to meet the Federation Elders at an undisclosed location in the asteroid belt.  The Feds still have some leverage over us. With the Maitreya still out there somewhere, the Feds still hold their trump card.  I'm thankful that this problem is above my pay grade.

Silverman is still sending messages to her beau back on Artemis Station. O'Connor's Los Angeles girl - her name is Carley - is planning to take him home to her family on Earth once the peace is finalized.  I've already bought tickets for you and me to hike Olympus Mons.  You'll take care of the Kansas logistics, right?  I'd love to meet your family, old man."

Lieutenant Commander Mozingo, thank you for agreeing to assist us.  $p Commander $p Tompkins recommended you highly. We requested your temporary reassignment due to your performance in the $h Maitreya reconnaissance operation. $f Special $f Operations $f Command needs someone who has experience seeing that thing up close.

You will report temporarily to the GTD $f Vengeance.  A transport is waiting for you in the $f Chanticleer's hangar bay."

8324, "Welcome to the $f Vengeance, Lieutenant Commander. I am Captain $p Scott $p Asakawa, 191st Black Watch, $f Special $f Operations $f Command.  Good to meet you in person. 

Let's get down to business. For the last couple months, the $h Maitreya and her escorts have jumped around $p Sol under radio silence, never staying anywhere long enough for us to launch a strike. Believe me, we've tried."

8325, "A $h UEF source has given us information that the $h Maitreya fleet has returned to $h Florence $h Station in the asteroid belt to refuel.  It'd be suicide to launch another bomber strike, and Admiral $f Steele doesn't want to risk capital ship assets."

8326, "We're taking a third option.  Using data from your scans, our engineers found a security flaw in the $h rebels' communications software.  They've programmed a $p virus that will allow us to see their sensor data in real time.

We'll get close to the $h Maitreya, scan its sensor system to upload the virus, and then jump out.  Stay at least 500 meters away from any escort fighters and don't open fire on anything unless you absolutely have to. Even if we're invisible on radar, they can still spot us with the Mark 1 eyeball."

It's been a pleasure flying with you, Lieutenant Commander. The next shuttle back to the Chanticleer's group is scheduled to depart in ten minutes."

8434, "My apologies for that outburst, Lieutenant Commander.
 
I logged into $f Fleetnet right after we jumped. The situation across the $p Sol theater is a mess. The $f Vengeance and GTD $f Phoenicia are under attack at the node.  The GTD $f Hood is pinned down at $p Mars by $h gunships. Same for the $p Ganymede garrison.   The GTD $f Agamemnon and GTD $f Implacable are preparing a counterattack.  Maybe they'll nail the $h Solaris - that destroyer has been a thorn in our side for far too long.

There's still no sign of the $h Maitreya, either, which has me worried. Using an old Starblade mining ship to mimic the Maitreya's jump signature was clever. I always wanted to see one of those in person. I did not anticipate I'd get my wish today.

It looks like this is the $h Federals' last hurrah. I'm not a gambling man, but I'm fairly certain they're going all-in."

8435, "What a mess of a sortie.  Sent on a wild goose chase, jumped by the Federation, and now we're left to pick up the pieces. The UEF really did a number on us, didn't they? Two destroyers lost in one day.  God help us all.

One of our scout wings reports that the Maitreya deployed to the node.  Fleet Command in Delta Serpentis went silent shortly afterward."

8436, "Move fast to kill Cancer wing and upload the virus.  If the Vengeance is destroyed early, the Federal admiral will sortie bombers to kill the Phoenicia. If you reach that point, there's nothing you can do."

8437, "What a mess of a sortie.  Sent on a wild goose chase, ambushed by the Federation, warped into the middle of a free-for-all, and barely escaped with our lives. God.  We lost a lot of good people there, but now is not the time to mourn.  Not yet. 
	
We're still not out of the woods.  The Phoenicia's drives were damaged by Federal torpedoes, and we've arrived well outside Artemis Station's perimeter. We'll have to go the rest of the way on fusion drives. Eta wing is on CAP now. We're going out there again in 30 minutes."

Lieutenant Commander Mozingo, you have one new unread message.  Open?"

8524, "MESSAGE 1
FROM: Rear Admiral Aria Shalmaneser, CO, GTD Phoenicia

To the officers and crew of the Phoenicia: 

In spite of all our gallant efforts, the $h Federal $h rebels had our number today.  We have made some emergency repairs, but our air wing has been decimated and the number 1 and number 2 engines are out of commission.  The navigational computer is badly damaged and we have exited subspace off course, several thousand meters from $f Artemis $f Station. We must get to $f Artemis's fortifications before they finish us off.  

The situation is bad, but this ship and its crew have survived far worse before.  Remember, ladies and gents, you serve on a ship that fought a $h Sathanas $h juggernaut and lived to tell the tale. It'll take more than a few $h Federal bombers to bring us down."

8525, "Pilots, for those of you who do not know me, I'm Captain $p Asakawa, formerly of the $f Vengeance's $f 191 $f Squadron.  With Captain Ahmed in the medbay, Rear Admiral $f Shalmaneser has asked me to serve as acting CAG of the $f Phoenicia."

8526, "We're slowly making our way back to $f Artemis $f Station on fusion drives, after our navigation error.  A repair transport is en route, as are Artemis's fighters.  But until those arrive, we're not home free yet."

8531, "Our mission is simple: protect the $f Phoenicia until relieved.

Lieutenant Commander $p Mozingo of the $f 52nd will lead $f Alpha wing.  I'll lead $f Zeta. Do your jobs, pilots, and we'll raise a glass for our comrades when we reach $f Artemis.  $f Iota wing, you're on standby.  Man your fighters."

8532, "Unknown hostiles"

8533, "At least we got the Phoenicia back in one piece.  She'll require an engine refit, but she should be battleworthy again in a few weeks.  While you were doing postflight, I checked Fleetnet. It sounds like the Federation deployed the Maitreya to the node after we left. We have a lot more action ahead of us. I'll speak with Commander Tompkins, and see if your squad could use another pilot.  I have not got much of a squadron left anyway.

Who's there? Yes, it's us, Commander Tompkins.  Could you give us a moment?

It's my duty to inform you that your temporary reassignment to Special Operations Command is officially over. You are released back to the 52nd Nomads.  You performed well under difficult circumstances.  You're an excellent pilot, Lieutenant Commander Mozingo, and I'm sorry that our mission didn't turn out better."

8534, "The Federals didn't manage to destroy the Phoenicia, but they may as well have.   With all the engine damage, it'll be more than a year before she can fight again.  At least her crew mostly survived.  There's a small army of transports evacuating it while the engineers get ready to tow her back to spacedock. 

Who's there? Yes, it's us, Commander Tompkins.  Could you give us a moment?

It's my duty to inform you that your temporary reassignment to Special Operations Command is officially over. You are released back to the 52nd Nomads.  You performed well under difficult circumstances.  You're an excellent pilot, Lieutenant Commander, and I'm sorry that our mission didn't turn out better. 

As an aside, while you were doing postflight, I checked Fleetnet. It sounds like the Federation deployed the Maitreya to the node after we left. I'll speak with Commander Tompkins, and see if your squad could use another pilot for the upcoming battle.  I haven't got much of a squadron left anyway.
