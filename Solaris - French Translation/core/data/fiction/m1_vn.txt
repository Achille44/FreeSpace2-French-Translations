"MESSAGE INBOX" "CAPTAIN GILES CAVILL - CAG" " "
Cavill "Lieutenant Ross. You the new Alban exchange pilot? Cavill, wing leader. Callsign 'Ahab'. Welcome to the Artemis." "01a-16"
Cavill "We're always happy to show Commonwealth pilots a thing or two about Federation service. 'Raptor' McKearney is another Commonwealth pilot here on exchange. You'll meet her later." "01a-17"
Cavill "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings." "01a-18"
Cavill "Artemis doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of a fleet carrier, but she's tough as nails with teeth to match." "01a-19"
Cavill "She's got a reputation in Fifth Fleet as a brawler that gets shit done. Looks like she'll be sinking her teeth into some Qahtadnan misfits." "01a-20"
Cavill "We're the only onboard squadron, a multirole combat unit flying Viper defenders and Hornet strikers. As the primary strike arm of Artemis, we'll be expected to interdict enemy strikecraft as well as support assaults against hostile warships." "01a-21"
Cavill "Anyway, I'll keep this short as I expect you'll be wanting to settle in. I'll see you at 0800 hours tomorrow for your orientation." "01a-22"
