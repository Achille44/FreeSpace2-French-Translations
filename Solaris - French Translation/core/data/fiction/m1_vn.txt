MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5871 "Task Force 55 is to assist the Elam Republic in their war against the Qahtadnan Union. Federation Defense Intelligence believes the Sinarus Combine has been providing military and logistical support to the Union Navy." 5873 "01a-03"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5871 "Our deployment will hopefully send a message to our old rivals that their attempts to destabilise the region will not be tolerated." 5874 "01a-04"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5871 "The FNS Artemis's area of operations will be the Durius system, one of the Republic's mining hubs. Our mission is to defend the system against Qahtadnan incursions. We can expect to take part in combat operations." 5875 "01a-05"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5871 "The Atlantean Federation has not declared hostilities against the Sinarus Combine. However any Combine forces identified in Durius are to be assumed hostile." 5876 "01a-06"

MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5871 "We arrive at Durius in seven days. All officers and crew are expected to be familiar with orientation material and emergency procedures before we arrive." 5877 "01a-07"

MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5603 "CAPTAIN GILES CAVILL - CAG" 5878 " "
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "Lieutenant Ross. You the new Alban exchange pilot? Cavill, wing leader. Callsign 'Ahab'. Welcome to the Artemis." 5880 "01a-16"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "We're always happy to show Commonwealth pilots a thing or two about Federation service. 'Raptor' McKearney is another Commonwealth pilot here on exchange. You'll meet her later." 5881 "01a-17"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings." 5882 "01a-18"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "Artemis doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of a fleet carrier, but she's tough as nails with teeth to match." 5883 "01a-19"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "She's got a reputation in Fifth Fleet as a brawler that gets shit done. Looks like she'll be sinking her teeth into some Qahtadnan misfits." 5884 "01a-20"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "We're the only onboard squadron, a multirole combat unit flying Viper defenders and Hornet strikers. As the primary strike arm of Artemis, we'll be expected to interdict enemy strikecraft as well as support assaults against hostile warships." 5885 "01a-21"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5879 "Anyway, I'll keep this short as I expect you'll be wanting to settle in. I'll see you at 0800 hours tomorrow for your orientation." 5886 "01a-22"
