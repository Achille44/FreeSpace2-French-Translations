5251, "(fr)In accordance with one of the terms of the alliance, the GTA must help the Vasudan Parliament eliminate the rebellious group known as the Hammer of Light. Vasudan Intelligence suspects that the main headquarters of the Hammer of Light is somewhere in the Antares system.  The GTA is sending forces to help the Vasudans find this base."

5252, "(fr)New Technology:

  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.
  The device first finds the nearest GTA communications beacon in the system. It then sends its coordinates to that station through a contained subspace portal.  All of the equipment is contained in a sensor-shielded container to prevent detection.  The SHB is simply a long-range homing device."

5253, "(fr)The $f GTA is sending the $f GTC $f Criff to the Antares system to help track down a Hammer of Light base in the area."

5254, "(fr)GTC Criff"

5255, "(fr)From their base, the Hammer of Light has been raiding several cargo depots in the Antares system.  Despite their best efforts, the Vasudan Parliament has been unable to locate the HOL base. With the new homing beacons, the GTA has come up with a plan to locate the HOL base."

5256, "(fr)HOL Base"

5257, "(fr)The Vasudan Parliament has set up a decoy cargo depot near the area where the Hammer of Light has been attacking.  In this facility there are three $f VAC $f 4 crates.  These contain electronic equipment and the hidden Subspace Homing Beacons (SHBs)."

5258, "(fr)SHB Containers"

5259, "(fr)Other cargo"

5260, "(fr)The Hammer of Light is expected to attack with a light group of fighters, and some freighters to carry away the cargo. You must allow at least one of their freighters to escape with a $f VAC $f 4 crate."

5261, "(fr)HOL Freighters"

5262, "(fr)HOL Fighters"

5265, "(fr)$f Alpha and $f Beta wings will be flying this mission.  If any heavier enemy ships arrive, $f Delta wing will be called in to deal with them.  If anything they can't handle arrives, the $f GTC $f Criff will jump in to assist."

5266, "(fr)Well done.  You managed to defend the cargo area from both the Hammer of Light and the Shivans, and you let the freighter escape with the SHB.  Hopefully the freighter will take its cargo to the Hammer of Light base,  and then we can launch an assault on them.  This is a very big step towards eliminating the Hammer of Light."

5267, "(fr)You jumped out before all the enemies were destroyed.  For this act you will be dishonorably discharged from the GTA.  I hope I never see your cowardly face again."

5268, "(fr)Do not hit ''Alt-J'' until you are told to return to base."

5269, "(fr)The mission is a failure!  The subspace homing beacons were destroyed.  We may never find the Hammer of Light base now."

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.  Remember pilots, our victory does not diminish the danger of Shivan fighters.  Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

5381, "(fr)Vasudan update:


What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.  Although there has been some minority Vasudan resistance regarding the continuance of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, for the most part, our two species have formed a solid partnership."

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

5388, "(fr)Because we had to remove your disruptors, engine disablement will be performed remotely by Flagstaff.  If you find any craft moving in excess of 30m/s, close  to 150 meters, scan the craft and the craft will automatically be locked down and cited."

Although Flagstaff's remote disruptors were unable to lock down the ship, your heroic feat of scanning a hostile warship is to be commended."

That you were able to single-handedly take down trained GTA fighter pilots is a truly awesome task.  Excellent work patrolman!"

5394, "(fr)Delta wing arrived too late to disable the Cruiser.  Apparently, the order from GTA Command to relocate our fighters was a setup.  Although the order was authenticated, Delta wing traveled two systems to escort a transport which never arrived.

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

5428, "(fr)Colonization Update

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies and defense for our frontier colonization efforts is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

5430, "(fr)EMAIL
To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5431, "(fr)Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

5432, "(fr)Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destiny on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space.  Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy.  Omega One contains a drone pilot and no passengers.."

5439, "(fr)The Destiny's fighters have been working back-breaking shifts since the rise of the mercenary rebellion.  Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

5440, "(fr)If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

5441, "(fr)Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

5442, "(fr)Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

5443, "(fr)Things got pretty rough out there.  You are to be commended for bringing your entire team back alive."

5444, "(fr)Although Delta wing really needed the rest, it is understandable that you called for reinforcements in the face of considerable opposition."

5445, "(fr)Try to complete the mission without calling for Delta wing."

5446, "(fr)The pilots on the GTD Destiny wish to thank you for handling the assignment without calling for them.  These weary pilots needed the rest badly."

5447, "(fr)We realize that things got pretty rough out there.  However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive.  With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

5448, "(fr)Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5449, "(fr)However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5450, "(fr)The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

5451, "(fr)Ultimately, this mission is a failure.  The personnel on board the Omega transports were the foremost experts on colonization science and technology.  Without them, we have little chance of successfully colonizing the new frontier planets."

5452, "(fr)The greatest threat to the Omega transport's is the wing of Athena bombers.  You may want to divide your wing and send some of Alpha to take the fighters, but make sure someone is taking care of those bombers."

A deeper investigation reveals that the ship's captain, John Wallace, is responsible for misleading the Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency to believe the merc force was being funded by HARC.  He has coordinated every attack from his flagship and must be brought to justice.''"

''The Terran race is an evil race of greedy souls who's consummate thirst for domination destroys everything it touches.  The GTA will pay for its sins!''  The statement seems to support Admiral Darcy's accusations."

5600, "(fr)To: 17412@nepenthe.gta
To all hands aboard the Nepenthe.  If you've read today's Command briefing then I assume you are frightened.  So am I.  We have been branded as traitors, and the GTA will throw everything they have at us.  I assure you all  that I did not send that communique.  We have moved the Nepenthe into the shadows of the Casa belt.  The joint council needs to know the treachery the Vasudans employed in order to win Mandala Prime.  Report for briefing in 20 minutes.
Capt. John Wallace (GTD Nepenthe)"

5601, "(fr)As you have probably all heard, the GTD Nepenthe is now the GTA's most wanted.  Although we have hailed the Alexander Bell comm outpost several times, our outgoing transmissions seem to be jammed."

5602, "(fr)Nepenthe"

5603, "(fr)In an attempt to avoid long range scans, we have moved the Nepenthe into the Casa Belt.  We will conduct a single operation here and then jump to the Alexander Bell and attempt direct contact."

5607, "(fr)Once you have removed the craft, return to base.  Know that the Alexander Bell is the only ally we have right now.  Both species want us dead...expect heavy resistance."

5608, "(fr)Excellent work pilot.  You were successful in taking out the unknown craft.  The craft was a modified Vasudan freighter and contained stealth technology and powerful communication devices.  Under any other circumstances, I would have ordered this craft captured.  However, we don't have that luxury right now."

5609, "(fr)Although we didn't have much time to hail the Alexander Bell, it appears that our message was going through.  Unfortunately, the communications outpost was not responding.  Since we are so far away from our home system, we will need to relay our message off of the Alexander Bell."

5610, "(fr)You succeeded in taking out all Vasudan fighters in the area.  In the light of recent developments, it sadly appears that every Vasudan craft which is destroyed will ultimately help the GTA in the coming months."

The Vasudan fleet is mobilizing in Manda to begin colonization of Mandala Prime.  Colonization will begin tomorrow at 0700 hours."

5630, "(fr)The rogue destroyer, the GTD Nepenthe has managed to evade the GTA.  Apparently, the Destroyer and her crew attacked a Vasudan science vessel which was studying the effects of asteroids on radio transmissions.  This outrageous slaughter has enraged Vasudans and Terrans alike."

5631, "(fr)Health and Science:

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communication station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus.  The outpost has been shut down and all transmission from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destiny."

5632, "(fr)As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a ''virus outbreak''.  We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command.  A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

5633, "(fr)Alexander Bell"

5634, "(fr)The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters.  Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

5635, "(fr)We know the workers on the outpost are not suffering from a virus.  We believe that the Admiral has reconfigured the radar dish so that the Bell cannot communicate.
Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

5636, "(fr)Our long range scans indicate that a their is some sort remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar.  Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell.  Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

5637, "(fr)I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

5639, "(fr)Hopefully, we'll survive long enough to get our message to command.  It all comes down to this ladies and gentleman.  May this be the last time we ever take the lives of other Terrans.  Godspeed."

If a few more minutes had passed, the secrets would have died with us.  As you probably noticed, our names have been cleared.  Excellent work."

5641, "(fr)Despite overwhelming odds, the Nepenthe survived the battle intact.  We owe this to the brave pilots who protected our ship in the face of certain death."

5642, "(fr)The GTD Nepenthe did not survive the operation.  Our beloved crew and captain will be sorely missed."

5643, "(fr)Make sure you protect the Nepenthe from the bomber wing, and work quickly to take out the dish once the shield is down."

5644, "(fr)With the destruction of the enemy fighters and the Cruisers, we snuffed the last flame of the mercenary rebellion."

5645, "(fr)Although it would have been nice to destroy the last mercenary cruisers, they shouldn't be too difficult to find and eliminate."

The Galactic Terran Alliance wishes to issue a formal apology to Captain John Wallace and the crew of the Nepenthe.  This ship and its brave crew managed to unravel a conspiracy which stemmed from one of the highest ranked officers in the GTA Navy, Admiral Darcy.  Commendations to the fine men and women aboard the Alexander Bell who conducted the investigation with the Nepenthe.

Apparently, the Vasudan empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA, and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime.  Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded.  The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destiny has already begun evacuation."

5696, "(fr)Mandala Prime:

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

5697, "(fr)War:

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

Protect the Destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

5708, "(fr)Congratulations, pilot.  You accomplished your goals and managed to survive one of the most deadly engagements in the history of Terran Galactic War.  Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

5966, "(fr)Elimination of the Hammer of Light officials will hinder the HOL. The Vasudans, however would have preffered their capture over their destruction."

5967, "(fr)After the transport carrying Bowman is disabled, concentrate on disabling the other two transports without destroying them.."

5968, "(fr)Allowing the Hammer of Light officials to escape shows poor judgement on your part, pilot. Our relations with the Vasudans were strained enough as it was, and now that you failed in this part of the mission, matters are even worse. Let's just hope our diplomats can smooth things over."

5969, "(fr)Capturing, or even destroying, the transports carrying the HOL personnel should be your main goal after Bowman's transport is disabled. Concentrate on not letting the transports escape."

Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.  GTA command believes that the removal of the cargo was undetected."

6155, "(fr)Sadly, alpha wing is smaller upon return.  As the possibility of war with the Vasudans grows stronger, it becomes even more imperative to protect your wingmen."

6157, "(fr)Ultimately, this mission is a huge failure.  The Manhattan was allowed to escape and the Vasudan scientists will be able to finish their research.  Don't be surprised if we see new Cap-ship killers in our next engagement with the Vasudans."

6202, "(fr)You did a fine job protecting the Omega transports, despite the fact not all the freighters escaped. While we could have used those extra supplies, what we escaped with will simply have to do."

6203, "(fr)Congradulations! Omega successfully retrieved the cargo and escaped the area undetected. The supplies in those cargo containers will allow the GTC Weaver to repair its communications systesm, and bring us one step closer to escaping enemy territory."

6465, "(fr)We have seen several Shivan cargo convoys come through this system. While we are not a military force, the loss of Earth will spell certain death for us, so we have decided to make an attempt to cut the Shivan supply lines."
