The news coming from our blockade at the $b Capella node isn't good. $f GTVA forces assigned to its defence were torn apart by the $h Sathanas shortly after it arrived, and casualties are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. The juggernaut has since made the jump to $b Capella$| , where hopefully the $f Colossus and the rest of the allied fleet can take it down. Some pilots were able to knock out a few of its turrets, so it'll give our side a much needed edge in that battle. The Alliance has since retaken both the $b Capella node and the new one formed on the old site of the Knossos leading back to the nebula.

We don't know how long we'll be able to hold these positions. The $h Shivan offensive is strong, but we must hold them back to give the $f Colossus a fighting chance."

5806, "$b -Defensive $b Operations

As you know, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine has been holding its position away from the nodes, launching squadrons to shore up our defences. The $f GTCv $f Warspite is currently overseeing our forces at the new node, while the $f GVCv $f Thebes stands guard at the one leading to $b Capella$| . The $f Psamtik is remaining in reserve, ready to counter any large Shivan attacks on our lines. The battle for $b Gamma $b Draconis is reaching its peak, and I expect all of you to do your part in showing everyone why the $g 309th is one of the best squadrons in the fleet.

Get down to the flight deck for your individual assignments, pilots. We're launching in ten minutes."

5807, "Okay $g Alpha$| , you're up for the next launch.

Your mission is to patrol the area around the $b Capella jump node, which is currently being monitored by the $f GVCv $f Thebes$| . You'll be relieving $f Delta wing off the $f Psamtik$| , who have been on station for the past thirty minutes. They have repelled several small $h Shivan attacks, but since the $f Thebes and other allied elements took down the $h SD $h Belith there have been no major Shivan efforts to take control of the area.

Your mission was a success. Against overwhelming numbers your wing managed to contain the Shivan offensive in Gamma Draconis. Our forces were stretched thin, and communications were largely spent dealing with the situation at the nebula node. The battle in Capella was fierce, and the last thing the Alliance needed were for the Shivans to reinforce the Sathanas. 

At 03:45 hours, the GTVA Colossus successfully destroyed the Sathanas juggernaut. Rear-Admiral Kamak of the GVCv Arensnuphis informed us that the Sathanas' explosion released some sort of subspace-based energy that briefly blanketed the area around the node and hampered communications. This interference has since ceased and contact with Command has been reestablished, but you can bet allied scientists will be interested in this. I've also received a communique from Captain Edjet of the GVCv Thebes thanking your wing for protecting his ship. The Thebes is now on its way to Vega for repairs. Excellent work pilots.

Additionally, the GVC Cusae survived this engagement and is now enroute to Vega as well. The cruiser was forced to withdraw from the area around the former Knossos as the Shivan offensive intensified. Thanks to your cover, that cruiser will continue to serve the Alliance well.

5943, "Copy, Thebes. Let's just hope we can get some help soon."

5944, "With the number of ships they're throwing at us, I can only guess how many they have hiding around in this system."

5945, "Well, here's hoping the other blockade keeps the bigger ones back. I doubt we'll be able to hold back another attack like that, let alone one supported by the Shivan armada."

5946, "Pilots, sensors have detected another incoming jump signature. Configuration suggests cruiser-sized. Detecting friendly IFF."

5947, "GVCv Thebes, this is the GVC Cusae. We are being persued by Shivan forces and require immediate fighter cover."

5948, "Alpha wing will escort you, Cusae. Why have you abandoned your position at the node, Captain?"

5949, "The Shivans broke our line, I'm afraid. The Warspite was forced to withdraw after taking heavy damage and the Abydos was destroyed by a Demon-class warship that entered from the nebula."

5950, "Admiral Khafre said he would commit the Psamtik and reserve forces to the node, and gave us permission to withdraw. We fixed in on the first nav coordinates we saw. Any moment longer and we surely would not have survived."

5951, "Very well. Cusae, you may join us in defending this node from further Shivan aggression until we are relieved."

5952, "How grave the situation is. We will stand our ground here with you, Thebes. We shall fight the Destroyers until the very last drop of blood!"

5973, "If that means what I think it is..."

5974, "Then you would be correct, pilot. The Colossus has prevailed and soon our efforts in this war will be rewarded. In the meantime, our ships will stand guard over the node. Alpha wing, you may return to base. Theta wing will provide fighter cover."

This is our second major victory over the $h Shivans in this current conflict, and the $f GTVA $f Security $f Council has given authorization to resume operations in the $b nebula now that we have beaten the Shivan offensive."

5987, "$b -The $b Phoenicia

However, there is a matter of pressing concern for us. As the Sathanas was marching its way to $b Capella$| , our blockade of the jump node leading to it crumbled when it encountered this warship. The $f GTD $f Phoenicia$| , the sister ship of the $f Aquitaine and commanded by Vice-Admiral Clarice Kellermann, was forced to crash-jump away from the node as the juggernaut unleashed a salvo onto it. The status of the destroyer is unknown, and Admiral Petrarch has ordered a search-and-rescue operation to find it. Efforts to trace their jump via subspace residue have proven futile following the heavy amount of subspace activity during the battle, contaminating the local area.

Originally ordered by High Command to hold their position, Kellermann disobeyed these instructions and withdrew the $f Phoenicia from the field of battle. Our losses have been immense in this war, and regardless of her intentions or what consequences she faces from Command, one thing is certain -- we must find them at all cost. "

The $f GVCv $f Arensnuphis and $f GVC $f Unut$| , commanded by Rear-Admiral Kamak of the $f 13th $f Battlegroup$| , will remain here as well to assist us, and losses sustained to the $f Aquitaine's air wing will temporarily be filled in by Vasudan wings from the $f GVD $f Hedetet$| . Command has dispatched a number of $y AWACS ships to sweep the system, which will help narrow down the time needed to find the vessel. Several warships in the fleet will also partake in the search.

Our enemy is still highly active in this system. At present, intel estimates that $h sixteen $h Shivan $h warships are still operational here. Many of these ships broke through our blockade at the nebula node before the $f Psamtik was able to stabilize that battle. Additionally, a $y Demon$| -class destroyer, the $h SD $h Zabaniyya$| , is believed to be leading these forces. If the $f Phoenicia did survive, then it will only be a matter of time before the $h Shivans track down that vessel. We believe they are hiding from the Shivans and running under radio silence, unaware of the Alliance's state of control in this system.

Our orders will be arriving shortly. Be on deck in thirty minutes."

Long-range scans running off of this data have since reacquired the $h Rusalka holding position near a small Shivan cargo depot, which not long after was joined by two additional cruisers with escorting fighter wings.

Our squadron and a $y Leviathan$| -class cruiser, the $f GTC $f Tannenberg, will jump in roughly six klicks away from the depot in an attempt to entice the Shivans to engage our small strike group with their cruisers. You must destroy all hostile forces sortied against the $f Tannenberg$| , paving the way for the next part of the operation. If we lose the $f Tannenberg, we're to abort the mission.

Should the $h Rusalka flee yet again, the $f GTCv $f Parapet$| , $f GTC $f Challenger and two wings from the 64th will pursue and take it down.

Be prepared to engage $h Shivan forces looking to snatch a trade for the $h Rusalka with one of our own ships. Should things get hot, the $f Aquitaine will deploy reinforcements to aid you. Success in this operation should throw a wrench into Shivan operational planning and buy us more time to locate the $f Phoenicia$| .

I also have some good news. Our squadron has finally received some new equipment, courtesy of the $f Aquitaine's weapons officer. The $y GTM-55 $y Trebuchet$| , the $y GTW-66 $y Maxim and the $y GTW-83 $y Lamprey $y Cannon are now available for use. The $y Trebuchet is an aspect-seaking missile with a range of over five klicks, and useful against bombers and warship turrets. The $y Maxim is a particle accelerator cannon that fires uranium slugs. It's terrible against shields, but will shred hull armour and is useful for disarming enemy turrets at range much like the Treb. Finally, the $y Lamprey drains the energy reserves of whoever's at the receiving end of it. Use these weapons how you see fit.

That is all. Happy hunting, pilots."

6070, "Excellent work, pilots. Despite overwhelming odds, you held your ground and protected the GTCv Guadalcanal and the GTC Tannenberg from a relentless Shivan ambush. It is clear now that the Rusalka and its depot were acting as a bait to lure our warships into a trap, but the Shivans' failure to execute their attack cost them a large number of their warships and strike wings. Both the Guadalcanal and the Tannenberg are on their way back to Capella to undergo repairs, but are expected to return to the front in several weeks.

The good news stops there though. While the brunt of the Shivan offensive was directed at your position, other units came under fire elsewhere in the system and losses were sustained, including a cruiser and two of our AWACS vessels. The Guadalcanal's sensor computers suffered an overload after sustaining heavy damage to its parent subsystem when the SC Lamia unleashed its opening salvo, and it'll take hours before any data on the Rusalka's jump can be safely pulled -- provided that there's anything left to recover. The Tannenberg was able to gather some data on both the Rusalka and the Zabaniyya's trajectories, but its older subspace monitoring suite makes it only somewhat more effective to our fighters. Right now our analysts are doing their best to determine where the Zabaniyya and Rusalka were heading to, so be ready to be called up at a moment's notice. Time's running out."

The mission was a complete success. Vice-Admiral Kellermann extends both her and her crews deepest thanks for the role you played in protecting her stricken ship. The Phoenicia would not have lasted much longer without your intervention. Medical frigates are already on the scene evacuating the survivors and a temporary crew will assume control of the vessel until they have reached an Alliance shipyard in Capella.

The destruction of the SD Zabaniyya and the remnants of its fleet has effectively nullified Shivan resistance in Gamma Draconis, and all that remain are a few errant fighters. The GTCv Parapet narrowly avoided its destruction and has since regrouped with us, and the GVCv Arensnuphis and its task group withstood all Shivan attacks launched against them. The ferocity of the enemy offensive caught all of us by surprise, and had the Zabaniyya been given the opportunity it would have finished off the 3rd Fleet before retreating to the nebula, but in the end we stand triumphant.  Allied forces operating in the nebula theatre will no longer need to worry about their lines being cut.

The last twenty-four hours have been tough, but with perseverence we have prevailed. Additionally, both Command and Admiral Petrarch have deemed it fitting that you all receive the Order of Galatea for your instrumental role in finding and saving the Phoenicia. You are indeed model fighter pilots worthy of envy across the GTVA.

Once the Phoenicia's engines have been repaired, the Aquitaine and its fleet will escort it back to Capella, where we will spend a few days to repair the damages sustained to our ships during this final battle. Normally I'd try to grant you guys some leave time for what you've done, but we won't be staying home for long. We have a war to win, and intelligence suggests that the Shivans are on the back foot, with the Ravana-class destroyer SD Andromalius their sole remaining command ship.

6294, "Destroy SD Zabaniyya"

6295, "Zeta wing survives"

6296, "God that sun- GTD Phoenicia, this is Alpha wing of the 309th Javelins Squadron. We're moving in to cover you."

6297, "You're a sight for sore eyes, Alpha. We need you to take down these fighters and intercept Aquarius. Most of our point defences have been disabled."

6298, "Will do, Vice-Admiral. Hang in there, we've got help on the way but they've been delayed by an attack by the Zabaniyya and its fleet."

6299, "Command's already informed us. The Zabaniyya was trailing us a short while ago before they suddenly departed. The Shivans must have realized how close we were to being saved and are trying to buy as much time as they can to finish us off."

6300, "I've also got a hunch that they're securing an exit once they've delivered that blow too. Unfortunately for them, that's not gonna happen!"

6301, "Nahema bombers, designated Taurus wing are attacking the Phoenicia. Don't let them get near that destroyer!"

6302, "Lilith-class cruiser Tannin has entered the area. Take out its beam turret before it rips the Phoenicia asunder!"

6303, "Come on Alpha Lead! Time to play dentist with that ugly bastard."

6304, "The Tannin's finally going down. Stand clear!"

6305, "This calm won't last long. I just hope we can keep the Phoenicia covered long enough till help arrives."

6306, "We're whittling them down bit by bit, three. We can do this."

6307, "Both Shivan warships are jumping in!"

6308, "Pilots, destroy the Rusalka and the Gorgon once Epsilon have arrived. We're slowly gaining the upper hand! Delta and Iota are being prepped for launch and will reinforce your position."

6309, "Roger that Command. Eyes up everyone! Rusalka's launching a wing of Maras. Let's clear them up before Epsilon gets here."

6310, "Copy that two. Let's go Alpha lead!"

6311, "GTC Challenger now on station. Moving to intercept the SC Tannin."

6312, "The Tannin's hull is going critical. Keep pouring on that fire!"

6313, "Cain-class cruiser neutralized!"

6314, "The SCv Rusalka is going down!"

6315, "The SD Zabaniyya has arrived and is closing in fast! Can we get some more backup out here?"

6316, "Reading multiple fighter and bomber wings emerging from that destroyer! Delta and Iota wings better get here!"

6317, "This is Iota 1. Hope you left some for us, Alpha."

6318, "It's time to end this battle. All units, intercept the Zabaniyya's air wing and nullify that destroyer. Take out that starboard beam emplacement before they can fire on the Phoenicia!"

6319, "You heard Command! Let's break them, Alpha leader!"

6320, "Pilots, this is the Phoenicia. If the Zabaniyya takes us down, they will make a run for it back to the nebula and finish what they started at the node -- it doesn't sound like 3rd Fleet stands a chance. It's all up to you."

6321, "Starboard beam has been destroyed!"

6322, "All Shivan fighters and bombers have been destroyed. Now deploying Zeta wing."

6323, "This is Zeta wing. We're closing in on the Shivan destroyer. Helios warheads are primed."

6324, "Roger that, Zeta 1. Alpha moving to escort you. That's a lot of firepower you guys have -- not that I'm complaining."

6325, "Ophiuchus wing on sensors. They are targetting us! Intercept them!"

6326, "All Dragons destroyed. Good work guys."

6327, "Zeta wing has been destroyed! Pilots, you will have to destroy the Zabaniyya without heavy bomber support."

6328, "The Zabaniyya's hull has reached critical levels. We're almost there!"

6329, "The SD Zabaniyya's hull is collapsing. Power surge detected! All units get out of there!"

6330, "Down she goes! Hit your burners!"

6331, "Command, this is the Phoenicia. The Zabaniyya has been destroyed. Thank you for the assistance everyone."

6332, "Woohoo!"

6333, "The SD Zabaniyya has been destroyed and all Shivan attacks have been beaten. We're deploying the relief force now. Await their arrival before departing. Good job everyone, you all deserve a medal for this. Command out."

6334, "We thought our lives were forfeit. Without your assistance we'd have been dead by now. Thank you."

6335, "I can't believe it, two. After all that's happened, I can't believe they made it."

6336, "We made it happen, pilot. As long as the three of us stick together, we'll make it through this war yet."

6337, "Amen!"

6338, "This is the GTC Warwick, relief forces have arrived. You have permission to depart, pilots."

6339, "Let's head on out. See you all back on the Aquitaine."

6340, "Got it."

6341, "Challenger here. We're got your aft side covered, Phoenicia."

6342, "Roger that, Challenger. Watch your beam fire and try not to clip us!"

6343, "The Phoenicia has been destroyed! Get out of there pilots!"

6344, "No... it can't... not after all of this..."

6345, "The GTC Challenger is going down!"

6346, "Holy shit!"

6347, "There's no time for sightseeing! Alpha 1, we gotta catch up with Beta and jump as soon as our drives have charged!"

6348, "We're snagged with a faulty charge flow on our main cannon! It'll take a few minutes to reset it!"

6349, "The SD Zabaniyya has arrived! Parapet, they are locking on to you! Crash jump NOW!"

6350, "You don't have to tell us twice, Aquitaine! All hands, executing jump now!"

6351, "Alpha and Beta wings, your drives are almost charged! We have synced your drives to the coordinates of the Phoenicia on our computers, and we will activate your drives in a few seconds."

6352, "You are the only help that can reach them until we have resolved this battle. Save them, pilots. Good luck."

6353, "Command, what's the status on reinforcements?"

6354, "Reinforcements will arrive as they become available, Alpha 2. The GVCv Arensnuphis reports a heavy Shivan fighter and bomber assault at the Capella node, and the Aquitaine is in a duel with the Zabaniyya."

6355, "Starting to sound like a broken record, Command!"

6356, "Acknowledged, pilot. Continue your mission."

6357, "Pilots, support ships from the Aquitaine are now available. Rearm if you need to. The Shivans will not give up on the Phoenicia so easily."

6358, "Yeah, yeah I think we can."

6359, "Pilots, the SC Tannin has broken off from the attack on the Aquitaine. The cruiser has been vectored towards your location."

6360, "Beta wing here. We can handle those bombers, Alpha!"

6361, "The SCv Rusalka and the SC Gorgon have broken off from the attack and are heading your way. Vasudan bomber wing Epsilon is launching from the Aquitaine and will assist you."

6362, "Pilots, the GTC Challenger has been authorized to pursue the Tannin. They will reinforce you as soon as their jump drives have spooled."

6363, "Epsilon wing on station. We are moving to engage the Shivan capital ships. Please suppress the enemy's turrets, Terrans."

6364, "Tannin main beam neutralized! We should help with those bombers now that the Tannin's been defanged."

6365, "All units, the Zabaniyya has abandoned its assault on the Aquitaine and is now heading for your position. Prepare for contact."

6366, "Come on, come one..."

6367, "All of our warships are heavily damaged and will stand no chance against the Zabaniyya, pilot. Iota and Delta are on their way, and we are preparing a heavy bomber strike to take down that vessel."

6368, "The Aquitaine never had the chance to use them against the Sathanas. Looks like we've got a front row seat to watch some really big booms."

6369, "Jump drives ready in:"
