    XSTR("Welcome back Lieutenant Commander. You completed your mission despite the most adverse of circumstances. The flame of duty burned brighter than the fires of Combine warheads. You and your crew embody the ideals that all King's Officers strive for.

Due to your successful mission, the balance of power has shifted in our favour. Erikson's intelligence on Combine missile systems will be critical, and Lau has relations with the Children of Renewal that we can leverage. 

I'm sorry to hear about Aria's losses. Doctor McGill reports at least one third of the crew are dead or incapacitated. Your crew's actions saved Cameron's life, but her recovery will take weeks, if not months. 

I can find people to bring Aria's crew back up to complement, but replacing senior command staff will be difficult. I'd bring in an officer from another ship to replace Commander Cameron, but our numbers are still depleted from the Vicare operation and no such officer is available. That being said, we have an alternative.

Admiral Cleghorn's approved your assignment as Aria's commanding officer. You'll hold the rank of acting Commander for the duration of this assignment. Congratulations.

You won't be going into the cockpit again anytime soon. I don't need another pilot. I need Aria at the right place, when the decisive moment arrives.

You've got a lot of work ahead of you Commander, but I'm sure you'll do the Navy proud. Long live the King.", 5792)
