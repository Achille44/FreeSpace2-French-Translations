1, "Deep in the Ross 128 system, the GTA Installation Riviera picks up a
distress call from a Terran pilot.  A disbelieving communications
officer listens as the pilot frantically requests cover from
phantom attackers."

2, "Ancients 1"

3, "The Ancients discover subspace and begin their empire."

4, "Lab Experiment"

5, "A joint Terran-Vasudan science team conducts experiments
utilizing captured Shivan technology."

6, "Command Briefing"

7, "GTA Intelligence briefs pilots on a daring and important plan
to counter Shivan advancement."

8, "Ancients 2"

9, "Strange and powerful forces attack the Ancients."

10, "Hall Fight"

11, "A GTA boarding party attempts to neutralize forces in a captured Shivan
freighter."

12, "Ancients 3"

13, "The Ancients begin their final struggle."

14, "Ancients 4"

15, "The Ancients understand their destruction."

16, "Ancients 5"

17, "The Ancients discover a weakness in their dark enemies, but not in time
to save themselves."

18, "End Game"

19, "The Shivan superdestroyer almost makes it to the Sol system, but the Terran-Vasudan
forces emerge victorious."

20, "The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA.  Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for three years.  There is no more important symbol of Terran pride than a ship like the Galatea or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety.  In the course of the fourteen-year war, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat."

236, "We require target data."

237, "Targeting data was not received."

238, "Cease firing on friendly craft!"

239, "Pilot, cease firing!"

240, "Aim at the hostiles, pilot!"

241, "That's a friendly ship, pilot."

242, "Cease firing on that ship, Terran!"

243, "Disregard that target!"

244, "You are firing on friendly targets, pilot."

245, "Cease firing!  That is not a hostile target!"

246, "Ship down!  Ship down!"

247, "Alpha 1, please respond!"

269, "Sir, I need a repair ship."

270, "This crate's about to blow.  Calling in for repair!"

271, "Subsystems compromised.  Requesting repair."

272, "You're straying too far from mission objectives!"

273, "Where are you going, pilot?"

274, "Where are you going, Terran?"

275, "You appear to be off course, pilot."

276, "You'll pay for that, traitor!"

277, "You will pay for your treason, pilot!"

278, "You have tested our patience long enough, Terran!"

279, "Your treason will not go unpunished!"

280, "All Terran pilots, shoot to kill Alpha 1."

281, "All units, destroy the renegade pilot!"

282, "Affirmative, sir."

283, "I'm on it."

284, "Roger that, sir."

285, "Yes sir."

286, "Yes sir!"

287, "As you wish."

288, "Affirmative."

289, "Roger, sir.  On our way."

290, "Acknowledged.  Stand by to rearm."

291, "We're already on our way, sir."

292, "Support request confirmed.  Please stand by."

293, "Support ship being deployed."

294, "Support request acknowledged."

295, "Rearming complete, sir."

296, "Rearming procedure complete."

297, "Rearming sequence aborted."

298, "Rearming procedure terminated."

299, "Support has been destroyed."

300, "Alpha 1, you're all alone.  No reinforcements available."

301, "We cannot deploy any additional fighters, pilot.  You are on your own."

302, "Have you lost your mind?  Training is terminated, return to base."

303, "Pilot, do not fire upon your instructor!"

304, "You are ordered to return at once, pilot."

305, "Pilot, you are straying too far from the engagement zone."

306, "Pilot, you are being removed from battle because of your insubordination."

307, "Pilot, this is your final warning.  Return to your assigned coordinates."

308, "Weapons array diminished.  Calling in for support."

309, "Ensign"

310, "Dang, you're still an Ensign!  You must have gotten busted!"

311, "Lieutenant Junior Grade"

312, "Congratulations.  Your achievements have been noted and you are duly awarded the rank Lieutenant Junior Grade."

313, "Lieutenant"

314, "Per GTAR 64-2a you are hereby promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.  Congratulations."

315, "Lieutenant Commander"

316, "Congratulations.  Your achievements have been noted and you are duly awarded the rank of Lieutenant Commander."

317, "Commander"

318, "Because of your consistent sense of duty and obvious skill as a leader, you have been promoted to the rank of Commander."

319, "Captain"

320, "For displaying a commanding nature and the ability to lead others you are hereby promoted to Captain.  Congratulations!"

321, "Commodore"

322, "For outstanding service through the war, leading many successful missions, and promoting a sense of honor and pride in the Alliance you have been promoted to the rank of Commodore."

323, "Rear Admiral"

324, "We aren't sure how you've done it, but you are hereby promoted to the prestigious rank of Rear Admiral.  (We think you cheated.)"

325, "Vice Admiral"

326, "You really must have cheated to get this rank!  Do you want to sit behind a desk or something?  That is what Vice Admirals do."

327, "Admiral"

328, "You really have got to stop cheating.  This could become a natural thing for you... and that would be bad.  Go on Admiral Cheater, I think you have to perform some ceremony or inspection or something."

329, "Advanced Space Superiority"

330, "Excellent"

331, "Light"

332, "Triton Dynamics"

333, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other GTA fighters."

334, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the GTF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed."

335, "Space Superiority"

336, "Fair"

337, "Medium"

338, "Han-Ronald Corporation"

339, "Original space superiority fighter of the GTA fleet.  Highly versatile, it often doubles as an assault fighter.  Low weapon compatibility."

340, "The Apollo is the most common GTA fighter.  It is highly versatile and can perform multiple roles, including space superiority, interception and assault."

341, "Interceptor"

342, "Good"

343, "High speed recon and bomber-intercept fighter.  Offers high weapon compatibility and payload."

344, "Using the old GTF Angel scout fighter as a template, the GTA created the Valkyrie interceptor fighter.  It has two additional engines, as well as an additional set of primary hardpoints.  This makes the Valkyrie the best bomber interceptor in the fleet.  Its speed is unmatched in the GTA, and its maneuverability is above average.  Its only drawbacks are a small secondary payload and a weak hull."

345, "Heavy Assault"

346, "Average"

347, "Low max velocity offset by its tremendous offensive capabilities.  High weapon capacity."

348, "The Hercules is the slowest and most unmanageable fighter in the fleet.  This is offset, however, by its overpowering weaponry and shielding.  It carries six primary weapons, as well as two full secondary banks.  This heavy assault fighter is best suited for small target attacks and bomber escort."

349, "Recon"

350, "High"

351, "Low"

352, "High max velocity offset by its tiny payload.  High weapon compatibility."

353, "Designed by GTI engineers, the Loki is undoubtedly the best reconnaissance craft in Terran or Vasudan service.  Its hull shape and shielded reactor chamber lends itself to providing a low sensor profile, yet it is capable of very high speed maneuvers.  Its relatively light armament and low armor rating make it unsuitable for extended firefights, however."

354, "Low offensive capability.  Best used in swarm situations."

355, "The old Angel scout fighter is second only to the Apollo in length of service and number of kills.  Developed as an interceptor/reconnaissance fighter in the first years of the Terran-Vasudan War, it also made a formidable match for the PVF Anubis and other early Vasudan fighters.  Upgrades to the Apollo have made the Angel largely obsolete, and the original design has since been retired in favor of its successor, the GTF Valkyrie."

356, "Light Bomber"

357, "Dynamic Metamer"

358, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Good speed for its size, with a high capacity afterburner reserve."

359, "The smallest bomber in the fleet, the Athena has oftentimes been mistaken for a fighter.  However, one should not be fooled by its small size.  The Athena can carry light bombs and most missiles.  It also has the ability to dogfight well.  Its strong shielding and hull make it the favored ''Lightning Bomber'' of the GTA."

360, "Strike Bomber"

361, "Poor"

362, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Can carry Tsunamis.  Good afterburner supply."

363, "Another product of GTI R&D, the Zeus strike bomber is a worthy successor to the Athena.  Its balanced design and increased reactor capacity give it remarkable speed for a bomber, yet it still remains capable of carrying the powerful Tsunami bombs.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against capital ships."

364, "Heavy Bomber"

365, "Heavy"

366, "Suitable for any size target.  Carries most missile types, but few cannons.  Armed with defensive turret, but still requires escort."

367, "The Medusa is the standard attack bomber in the GTA.  Its strong shielding and large secondary capacity make it the favored attack craft against cruiser class targets.  As the first bomber to carry the Tsunami bomb, the Medusa is considered the staple of any bomber pilot's career."

368, "Assault Bomber"

369, "Very Poor"

370, "Designed to annihilate capital ships and cruisers.  Slow, but offers unparalleled assault bombing capability."

371, "The Ursa is the first bomber designed specifically for the purpose of annihilating capital ships.  It carries a massive payload and is the only bomber in the GTA which can equip the Harbinger bomb.  Strong shielding and hull make the Ursa very difficult to destroy."

372, "The Amazon is a simple drone, used for basic combat training.  They are unmanned, and carry only the weakest of weaponry."

373, "The Advanced Amazon is a larger drone, used by the GTA for subsystem and large target training.  They are unmanned and inexpensive."

374, "The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible.  It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

375, "Since the start of space colonization, this standard transport has been used by everyone, both civilian and military.  While it has undergone minor changes time and again, it remains a simple design: a vehicle meant to transport personnel from one place to another."

376, "Tactical Transport"

377, "Very Heavy"

378, "Kallisti Corporation"

379, "Designed for tactical delivery of troops to enemy positions.  Low maneuverability offset by high armor rating and max velocity."

380, "The GTT Hunter was designed by GTI for surgical strike purposes requiring small squads of highly-trained marines.  Faster, smaller, and more heavily armed than the Elysium, it is capable of performing limited offensive roles in addition to carrying soldiers and cargo.  The GTI primarily uses these ships to deposit small teams of special forces units to soften up the enemy in preparation for larger assaults by conventional boarding parties."

381, "The Poseidon is the standard military freighter in the GTA.  It is designed to protect its cargo from any kind of attack, and has four turrets with which to do so."

382, "The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTA for deep space cargo transport.  It has all the electronics and systems needed to preserve any cargo within it at whatever conditions are necessary.  TC 2s are cheap to manufacture and are heavily used throughout the Alliance."

383, "The TSC 2 was developed when Terran Command decided it needed a stronger and more secure cargo container for use in military operations.  It improves on the established TC 2 design by sacrificing a small amount of internal space for a significantly stronger hull.  Although it is still not as strong as the TAC 1, the TSC 2 is usually the GTA's container of choice for cargo with military value."

384, "The TTC 1 is another example of civilian equipment used by the GTA League of Defense.  It is primarily a tech container used for research purposes, especially zero-G development operations.  It is not very strong, however, and is often a target of enemy attacks."

385, "The Chronos is a freighter of civilian design.  As the Terran-Vasudan war dragged on, more and more of these vessels were commissioned by the GTA for use in military operations.  These vessels are slow but strong."

386, "The TAC 1 (called the TacOne by most pilots) is a heavily armored container, usually used for carrying volatile or dangerous substances.  It is also the preferred supply container for use in front-line operations."

387, "The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the T-V war wouldn't be over in a few months."

388, "After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, Command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds."

389, "The Faustus science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft.  However, in the fourteen years since the Terran-Vasudan war began, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research.  Its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships, hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle."

390, "The standard Terran Probe is an all-purpose instrument that can be used in a variety of situations.  They are found in missions ranging from unmanned exploration of new systems, to scientific observation of interesting areas of space, to surveying of patrol routes or suspected enemy positions.  In a pinch, they can be deployed as communications buoys or as couriers for important messages or scientific data.  Their great speed and small size make them useful in battle situations where the enemy will most probably give them a low target priority."

391, "The GTD Hades is a new class of Terran destroyer constructed under the authority of the GTI.  Not much is known of its design or purpose, but it appears to be an attempt to recreate the SD Lucifer.  All available data on the Hades has been highly classified by Terran Command.

The Hades should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

392, "Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia-class station was commissioned, GTA decided to reclassify it as an installation rather than a space station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia-class installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability."

393, "The GTI Polaris is the GTA's standard drydock facility.  A network of Polaris modules allows construction and maintenance of nearly any Terran ship in service.  The drydock's modular design allows inexpensive replacement of damaged sections should one of these facilities come under attack."

394, "Asteroid bases such as these are used by both civilian and military contractors to mine resources and conduct experiments."

395, "The Terran NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Terran convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

396, "The Watchdog is the standard unmanned defensive sentry turret for the GTA.  It fires two standard plasma bursts at any nearby hostile targets."

397, "The Cerberus is an advanced version of the Watchdog, with stronger weaponry and the ability to withstand more damage."

398, "The Hermes escape pod has been used since the destruction of the GTD Goliath over twelve years ago.  They are used by the crews of destroyers and installations to escape destruction.  It is always best to be prepared."

399, "Mekhu/Triton"

400, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other PVN fighters."

401, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the PVF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.

The PVF Ulysses is nearly identical to the GTF Ulysses, except that the Vasudan variant can accommodate Vasudan pilots in its cockpit."

402, "Light Skirmish"

403, "Mekhu Enterprises"

404, "Lowest power Vasudan craft.  Offers little in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.  Best used in swarm situations."

405, "The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

406, "Heavy Fighter"

407, "Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

408, "As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

409, "Very Good"

410, "Akheton Corporation"

411, "Extremely fast with good weapons compatibility.  Very useful in any kind of engagement."

412, "The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA.  This makes it extremely dangerous.  Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy.  This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.

As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible."

413, "Sahr Corporation"

414, "Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

415, "The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses-class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

416, "Bomber"

417, "Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However, carries good payload including space bombs.  Most commonly used in cruiser strikes."

418, "The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations.  It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor.  It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity, and is faster and more maneuverable.

The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris cruisers and a D class threat otherwise."

419, "Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

420, "The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion-class destroyers in the past two years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

421, "Hammer of Light"

422, "Vasudan-Shivan hybrid.  Fast and powerful."

423, "The PVB Sekhmet is a Hammer of Light ship that appears to be a fusion of Vasudan and Shivan technology.  The Hammer of Light claims that its design was adapted from a new class of Shivan bomber heretofore unencountered by either the GTA or the PVN.

Sporting four primary weapon hardpoints and three missile bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch.  Treat it as a class A threat to all allied capital ships."

424, "The Jackal is a simple training and reconnaissance drone used by the PVN.  As the Jackal could be mass-produced quickly and cheaply, it was not long before the Vasudans used it as a template for the PVF Anubis, a piloted variant well suited for use as a swarm fighter.

The Jackal has never been used offensively against the GTA and is classified as a non-threat."

425, "The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

426, "The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size.  Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally this class has been known to act as a repair ship or tugboat.  It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position."

427, "The Bast freighter is unarmed, and considered a non-threat.  We believe that it is mainly used by Vasudan civilians, but we have seen some in front line operations.  It has very low target value, but should be destroyed, as any kind of resupply ship is a danger to the GTA."

428, "The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

429, "With three turrets, the Ma'at is a hairy target for GTA pilots to attack.  However, it is slow enough that it can be destroyed with enough patience.  As always, supply ships for the PVN are considered to be valid targets."

430, "The VAC 4 series of cargo containers is much like its normal counterpart, except it has much more plating.  However, this container is no more dangerous than the standard version, and is nothing more than ML-16 bait without protection of some kind."

431, "The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter.  It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot.  However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a class C threat.  Treat it as one."

432, "The Aten-class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans' warships, falls short as a attack cruiser.  It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry.  With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.  Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

The Aten-class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a class B threat."

433, "The PVSC Imhotep is the standard Vasudan research vessel.  Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys.  One major difference between the two classes is that the Imhotep carries a small podbay housing four remote research pods.  These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems."

434, "This large probe is more of a fully-fledged research pod than a simple drone.  Designed to work in collaboration with an Imhotep science cruiser or as part of team of probes, it is capable of numerous roles including observation, experimentation, and scientific analysis.  It is often possible for a wing of probes to conduct minor missions independent of outside supervision, allowing Vasudan Command to reserve their Imhoteps for deployment where the personal presence of scientists is most needed."

435, "Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations.  The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology.  When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.

The Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup."

436, "The gargantuan Karnak installation is the Vasudans' answer to the GTI Arcadia.  This monstrous facility bristles with dozens of turrets and can house up to two full squadrons of fighters.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a construction and maintenance yard for the Vasudan fleets.

Because of its enormous logistical and strategic value, the Karnak is considered a class A threat."

437, "The PVI Shah is nearly identical to our GTI Polaris, despite the fact that they were designed separately.  Like the Polaris, the Shah serves as a construction and maintenance facility."

438, "The Vasudan NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Vasudan convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

439, "The Ankh is the standard Vasudan sentry gun.  Its most common usage is guarding supply depots.  However, since the development of the Anubis, its usage has dropped off significantly."

440, "The Ra has been used by Vasudans since our first encounter with them.  Every Vasudan capital ship has a few of these lifeboats."

441, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity.

The GTA considers the Dragon as a class A threat."

442, "Captured Shivan fighter, modified for Terran pilots."

443, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity."

444, "The Basilisk seems to be a Shivan heavy attack fighter.  It is not as maneuverable as other Shivan fighters, but it packs quite a punch, and it is very resistant to our weaponry.  Most often they have been used in attacking our supply convoys and transports.

Treat the Basilisk as a class C threat."

445, "We believe that the Manticore is a Shivan interceptor.  It has a very high top speed, and its maneuverability is quite good.  However, its shield system isn't strong enough to withstand constant fighting for long, which leads us to believe the Manticore's primary purpose is to destroy enemy bombers.

The Manticore ranks as a class B threat."

446, "We originally thought the Scorpion was the Shivans' best fighter.  However, we now believe that the Scorpion is nothing more than a Shivan scout ship.  Their vast numbers and seeming unimportance to the Shivan war effort leads us to this belief.  Regardless of its purpose, the Scorpion is highly maneuverable, fast, and difficult to destroy.  It can also do damage equivalent to our space superiority fighters.

In the event that you encounter Scorpions, regard them as a class C threat."

447, "The first encounter with the SF Gorgon was made by the GTD Saratoga in the Ikeya system.  We are uncertain if this is a new Shivan design or if the Shivans have simply held this particular class of ship back for the majority of the war.  The ship's unusual design not only provides it with exceptional maneuverability, but also allows it to generate an extremely powerful shield.  So far these ships have only been sighted leading wings of lesser fighters, but there have been reports of entire wings of Gorgons in larger forces.

Little else is known about the Gorgon.  It should be considered a class B threat when acting as a wing leader, but a full wing of Gorgons is to be treated as a class A threat to all allied vessels."

448, "The Shaitan bomber is only slightly superior to our own bombers - its shielding is better, but its capacity seems to be far worse.  Perhaps the Shivans were confident that they would only need one payload to destroy a target.

We consider the Shaitan to be a class C threat."

449, "The Nephilim-class bomber is the most alien of the Shivan ships.  We are still unsure as to why the Shivans chose this odd shape for arguably their most powerful attack craft.  However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to wings of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.

The Nephilim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

450, "The new Seraphim class bomber is the Shivan's latest threat.  It is three times larger than a Nephilim, and carries a massive payload at least 150% the size of the Nephilim.  With strong hulls and an almost impenetrable shield system, the Seraphim is easily the most dangerous bomber we have yet encountered.

The Seraphim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

451, "The SB Nahema has never actually been encountered by either GTA or PVN forces, as far as we can determine.  What little intelligence we have on this bomber comes from our interrogations of HOL prisoners and is strictly classified by GTI.  We do know that the Nahema was the base from which the HOL constructed the PVB Sekhmet, their Vasudan-Shivan hybrid prototype bomber.  How the HOL managed to acquire scans of the Nahema in the first place is unknown."

452, "The Azrael is most likely a Shivan transport.  While we are not completely sure of its uses, we do know that it can house many Shivans.  It is not very heavily armored, and its weaponry is not too strong.  This makes the Azrael the most common target for capture attempts."

453, "The Mephisto freighter behaves much like one of our own, but it is far more powerful and dangerous.  Very little data is available on this ship class."

454, "We believe that the Shivans use cargo containers such as these as storage depots.  We have yet to see a Shivan land on a planet.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans plan on keeping all of their materials and resources in deep space."

455, "Almost no data is available on the Asmodeus freighter.  We are aware that it has a strong hull and four turrets.  Any further data on this ship should be immediately delivered to Terran Intelligence."

456, "What we have dubbed the SAC 2 is simply a more heavily armored form of the standard Shivan cargo container.  We believe that this is where the Shivans keep their more precious supplies.  SAC 2s are to be captured or destroyed at every opportunity."

457, "The Cain is by far the most common cruiser in the Shivan fleet.  It is also the weakest.  However, the Cain should not be underestimated.  It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.

The Cain is a class B threat."

458, "While far more rare than its counterpart, the Cain-class cruiser, the Lilith is one of the most ferocious cruisers we have had the misfortune of combating.  It has extremely strong weapon systems, as well as a very thick armor which our cannons can barely penetrate.  One for one, the Lilith can easily destroy any of our cruisers.  It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.

The Lilith should be considered a class A threat to any ships that encounter it."

459, "While the Demon-class destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada.  However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters.  It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.

The Demon is a class A threat in any allied system."

460, "The Lucifer is the greatest threat to the survival of the GTA, the PVN, and both the Terran and Vasudan species.  It wields three massive flux cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation.  The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.

Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.  If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

461, "We believe that the sole purpose of the Trident is to guard Shivan repair and supply depots.  It is not too strong, but in large numbers it can be dangerous."

462, "Terrans"

463, "Terrans originated on the third planet in the Sol system, known alternately as Terra or Earth.  Terrans are relatively physically weak, but are highly intelligent and versatile.  This combination of intelligence and versatility have allowed Terrans to evolve from tribal, nomadic primates (not entirely unlike their progenitors) to a spacefaring race.

Terran civilization developed to the point of relatively stable nation-states.  With space travel, the nation-state evolved into the global-state and the Terran species furthered its growth, both in material ways and in immaterial, philosophical ways.  In time, the global-state led to the intersystem-state, which in turn led to the Galactic Terran Alliance, a galactic-state.

To date, Terrans have successfully colonized twelve worlds outside of the Sol system.  Outposts have been established on fifteen other planets and moons throughout the known galaxy.  If the past is any indicator of future trends, unified expansionism will only continue to benefit the Alliance, both politically and economically."

464, "Vasudans originate on the fourth planet of the Vasuda system, the only planet in that system that is capable of supporting life.  Their home planet, also known as Vasuda Prime, is a relatively hostile world.  Both of the twin continents of Vasuda Prime are almost entirely desert, and most of the above-ground water is, even by Vasudan standards, undrinkable.  In order to adapt to these surroundings, Vasudans developed quite rapidly.

Vasudan society is complex and filled with peril for the outsider ignorant of their culture.  Vasudans have a range of social tests and protocols, such as The Conversation.  A Terran mishandling of The Conversation is presumed to be one of the major causes of the V-T War.  The Vasudan government is parliamentary in nature, but is presided over by the Imperial family and the Ambassadors, who are quasi-royal go-betweens for the Parliament and the Imperium.

Vasudan space exploration has been driven primarily by the need to find planets capable of sustaining their species.  As resources on Vasuda Prime have diminished, the drive to colonize has intensified among Vasudans in recent decades."

465, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

504, "Don't fire upon friendly ships."

505, "GTW ML-16 Laser"

506, "Standard issue
Medium Hull Damage"

507, "Argon laser weapon - uses transparent ceramic technology in order to create an optical system that is extremely durable and stable under battle conditions - provides adequate destructive damage to the hull of enemy ships by vaporizing molecular bonds at the target area and destabilizing molecular bonds across the grain of the hull material.

The GTA issues ML-16 Lasers to every fighter and bomber in service."

508, "PVW VLL-9 Laser"

509, "Neon laser weapon - uses silvered optics to create a coherent package of energy that is extremely reliable under battle conditions - energy package infuses plasma bolt which is fired at a rate of 2 rounds/second - high thermal mass vaporizes most materials upon impact - prolonged application will cause material integrity failure and hull breach.

Standard issue to Vasudan ensigns.  This cheap, mass-produced laser cannon is similar in performance to the ML-16 but is slightly more effective against insulated subsystems."

510, "GTW-41 Disruptor Cannon"

511, "Standard issue
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

512, "A gas-focused krypton laser - when the ship is in flight, the chamber of the GTW-41 rotates at a constant speed - a small amount of NO2 is injected into the container .05 ms prior to the emission of the laser light - the rotation of the NO2 in the chamber focuses the laser pulse to a state that is only very slightly (1%) diffused - after the laser pulse is emitted from the chamber into space, the chamber expels the NO2 into space (thus expelling ionized molecules and moisture) - the process repeats for each subsequent burst of laser energy - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - the Disruptor Cannon is best suited and is used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Disruptor Cannon should be utilized in all capture operations in order to minimize risk of target's destruction."

513, "GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor"

514, "Advanced Version
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

515, "The Advanced Disruptor Cannon is much like the GTW-41 Disruptor.  However, its speed and higher subsystems damage make it much more useful in operations against faster moving targets."

516, "GVW Akheton SDG"

517, "Tactical Weapon
Subsystem Disruption"

518, "A gas-focused krypton laser - fixed position firing chamber with quartz-timed injector - dynamic magnetization of the diffused laser pulse responds to feedback from targeting sensors - enhanced gaseous acceleration technology results in higher projectile velocity - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - best suited and used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun is a Vasudan retrofit of the GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor cannon.  Alongside the Prometheus Retrofit it is being pushed into mass production as part of a new generation of standard-issue weaponry, replacing the ML-16s and Disruptor Cannons used since the war between our species ten years ago.  While optimized for next-generation warships currently in development, older fighters may be unable to keep up with its demanding power requirements."

519, "GTW-15 Avenger Cannon"

520, "Special Issue
Projectile Weapon
Low Shield Damage"

521, "A rapid-fire, computer-controlled radar and gun system - capable of firing at a rate of more than 4500 rounds per minute - used primarily for close-defense situations - uses closed-loop radar technology to locate, identify, and direct a stream of highly destructive 45mm projectiles to the target.

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.  It has also proven very effective against Vasudan fighters.  However, its substandard anti-shield capabilities make it a poor choice for dogfighting Shivans, although far better than the ML-16."

522, "GTW-32 Flail Rifle"

523, "Special Issue
Low Energy Usage
Kinetic Weapon
Moderate Shield Damage"

524, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

525, "GTW-5 Prometheus Cannon"

526, "Prototype
High Energy Usage
High Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

527, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

528, "GTW-5a Prometheus Cannon Adv."

529, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

530, "Designed as a special-issue upgrade to the standard Prometheus, the Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity.  These advances come at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption, but many pilots feel that the tradeoff yields a net benefit.  This weapon's deployment is currently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions."

531, "GTW-5r Prometheus (retrofit) Cannon"

532, "Standard Issue
High Energy Usage
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage"

533, "GTW-5r Prometheus Retrofit"

534, "The GTW-5a Prometheus R is a modified version of the original Prometheus weapon.  With the link to Earth severed, the GTVA had been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of argon (a required element in the Prometheus's power-generation module) to continue to manufacture the standard Prometheus.  GTVA engineers modified the original design to incorporate some of the advanced electromagnetic mechanisms of the Banshee.  The technology has not been perfected, however, and the Prometheus R suffers from a long recharge cycle and high energy requirements."

535, "GTW-7 Banshee"

536, "Special Issue
EM Weapon
Very High Energy Usage
Extreme Shield Damage"

537, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

538, "GTW-65 Railgun"

539, "Prototype
HiVel Weapon
Long Recharge Cycle"

540, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

541, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

542, "Prototype
Depletes shields"

543, "Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon is very effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim."

544, "GTW-43 Leech Cannon"

545, "Tactical Weapon
Drains Energy
Low Damage"

546, "The Leech Cannon depletes the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use it to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.

The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

549, "UD-1 Volz"

550, "Unstable Derivative Mark One - Xaser weapon, firing an intense, highly focused beam of x-ray emissions - modified power conversion unit interfaces directly with Shivan electronics - extremely limited availability during testing phase.

The UD-1 Volz is a weapon prototype retrofitted from Shivan armaments captured by the GTI.  R&D has modified an undisclosed number of fighters to mount the cannon, and preliminary tests have shown it to be effective against shields and hulls of all varieties."

551, "GTM MX-50"

552, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

553, "Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

554, "GTM-3 Fury Missile"

555, "Standard Issue
Maximum Compatibility"

556, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - GTA fighters can carry more Fury missiles than conventional missiles, due to their small size - used for distraction and other tactical measures - very small payload (3 Kt).

Use is recommended in close combat situations and against larger targets where tracking is a non-issue."

557, "PVM-7 Fang Missile"

558, "Standard Issue
Twin Fire
Maximum Compatibility"

559, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - low accuracy offset by high speed and immunity to electronic countermeasures - very small payload (2 Kt).

A Vasudan missile design employing a 'twin fire' technique.  It is a good choice for close combat and freighter attacks, where tracking is a non-issue. The twin-fire design increases the payload per volley and damage potential for hit-and-run attacks.  The GTA is developing its own swarm missile based on the Fang."

560, "GTM-9 Interceptor"

561, "Standard Issue
Fast Target Lock"

562, "All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

563, "GTM-4 Hornet Swarm Missile"

564, "Special Issue
Swarm Type
Slow Target Lock"

565, "Infrared and ultraviolet tracking - designed to fire in small groups of 4 missiles per burst - light medium payload per missile (12 Kt) - semi-intelligent on-board tracking - single-pass kill probability will not exceed 60% on average - designed as an offensive version of the Fury.

As a ''swarm'' based weapon, this missile can take out an unshielded fighter without any difficulty.  Its four missile system almost guarantees one or two hits, and its speed is quite amazing.  Twice as powerful against naked hulls."

566, "GTM Phoenix V"

567, "Special Issue
Anti-Bomber Missile
Slow Target Lock"

568, "All-aspect seeking - same tracking system as the Interceptor - large payload (50 Kt), but slower than the Interceptor - one of the best fire-and-forget missiles ever developed - many fighter pilots within the GTA regard the Phoenix V as the weapon of choice against high value, heavily defended targets.

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

569, "GTM-31 Disruptor Missile"

570, "Advanced Prototype
Tactical Missile
Disrupts Subsystems"

571, "Advanced signal processing - high precision interception capability - small payload (9 Kt), combining both conventional explosives and a localized blast of energy caused by the effect of impact upon the laser-propulsion system of the missile - designed to temporarily disable subsystems on hostile targets.

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

572, "PVM-2 Havoc Missile"

573, "Special Issue
Fragmentation warhead"

574, "Havoc missiles were special issue during the 14-Year War to Vasudan aces.  It holds the title of being the first missile to use the remote detonation technique later used in the Cluster Bomb.  Chips and shards of non-explosive shrapnel surround the explosive core, stripping shields and armor from its target.  Subsystem damage is minimal due to its superficial damage.  With the development of shield technology, the Havoc is now used against unshielded cargo formations and such."

575, "GTM-1 Synaptic Bomb"

576, "Advanced Bomb
Wing Attack Cluster Explosion
Area Effect"

577, "Missile propulsion unit carrying several small intelligent ''bomblets'' - when distance to target is less than 100 m or when time to impact is less than 2 sec., bomblets direct missile to the most vulnerable part of the ship of those parts of the ship facing the missile - bomblets then separate from missile propulsion unit and form a sphere - inertia continues to carry bomblets in the direction of the target - the missile propulsion unit continues to advance toward the target - when the missile hits the target or 1.5 sec.  after the missile should have hit the target, the bomblets explode - the spherical shape of the formation of the bomblets helps to ensure a fairly even level of damage across a sensitive area on the target - the spherical shape also ensures that the target will not be able to effectively maneuver away from the blast, thus ''pinning'' the target to a specific area in space - can also act as dumbfire - medium payload per bomblet (15 Kt) - very small payload for missile (2 Kt).

Nicknamed the ''Earthshaker'' by the bomber pilots who tested this, it is a bomber's best defense against fighters.  The Synaptic Bomb can do a lot of damage to a lot of ships at one time."

578, "GTM-86 Cluster Bomb"

579, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile"

580, "A second-generation Synaptic bomb, this GTI-developed cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against entire wings of enemy ships.

Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a large field of blast field, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

581, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

582, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile
Destroys Subsystems"

583, "Heat seeking - laser tracking similar to the Interceptor - missile is protected by a small shield system, allowing for greater success in payload delivery during busy melee situations and intense firefights - fast, but low in-flight maneuverability compared to other missiles of comparable size - low maneuverability due to the size of the missile's payload (60 Kt) and on-board shield system.

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

584, "GTM-11 EM Pulse"

585, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse weapon
Anti-bomber weapon"

586, "Upon impact, the EM Pulse temporarily disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

587, "PVM-1 Barracuda Torpedo"

588, "Standard Issue

Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Moderate Lock/Reload Time"

589, "The Barracuda torpedo has been in use by the PVN since the outbreak of the Terran-Vasudan War.  These antimatter weapons do much more damage than our Phoenix V missiles, but are smaller than normal space bombs.  The Barracuda is favored by the Vasudans for attacks against cruisers and stationary installations.  Osiris bombers commonly fire these weapons in pairs for knocking out turrets on capital ships.  The Barracuda's targeting system is prone to malfunctions, and a common field modification is to bypass the aspect lock system completely, permitting dumbfire launches."

590, "GTM-3 Tsunami Bomb"

591, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

592, "Intelligent tracking similar to GTA targeting system - prior to launch, communicates with ship computer, gathering data about enemy target types and whereabouts - slow, low maneuverability - antimatter warhead (500 tonne mass-to-energy conversion) - due to instability of antimatter, no more than 10 may be carried on board a GTA bomber at any given time, unless pilot is granted a special permit by an appropriate governing body.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

593, "GTM-X1 Serkr Bomb"

594, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Non-Conventional Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

595, "Non-conventional thermonuclear warhead - estimated explosive yield not less than 3125 Mt - massive destructive capability not suited for tactical subsystem destruction - highest damage for its size of any GTA bomb - a single bomber carrying GTM-X1 ordnance has a damage potential two-thirds greater than one carrying GTM-N1 ordnance - single stage liquid fuel rocket booster - smallest turn radius and greatest linear velocity of any GTA bomb - highly efficient design for extended weapon lifetime.

The Serkr is a high-yield warhead developed as part of a top-secret GTI experimental weapons program.  Sacrificing anti-subsystem capability for sheer hull-damaging power, the Serkr delivers a destructive payload 33 percent greater than the more common Tsunami.  Like the Tsunami, the Serkr can be loaded on the Medusa medium bomber for tactical deployment -- and with a top speed of 95 m/s, this bomb stands a good chance of eluding even the fastest interceptor fighters.  GTI pilots have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Serkr against capital ships of all types."

596, "GTM-N1 Harbinger Bomb"

Anti-Capital Ship Bomb
Tactical Fusion Warhead
Extremely Long Lock/Reload Time"

598, "Fusion bomb surrounded by 3 salted fission bombs - propulsion unit is a half-size version of a regulation GTA fighter thruster (Class II) - given the weight of the payloads, the missile is slow despite the power of the thruster - as the Harbinger is exceptionally large, GTA bombers are limited to carrying 6 of these weapons at any given time - the resultant shock wave from this weapon is potentially deadly, due to the size of the payloads (5000 Mt in total) - use near allied installations or allied ship groupings is strongly discouraged by the GTA - most effective when used in preemptive defensive strike against non-military installations.

The Harbinger is our best chance of destroying the Lucifer."

810, "Now I am going to show you how to disarm your target using your wingmen.  Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging box again."

811, "Now, select [2] to send your orders to a wing rather than just a ship, then the [1] key to choose Epsilon wing.  By choosing Epsilon wing, you are sending your orders to that wing only.  Finally press the [3] key to ''Disarm Target''."

812, "Observe that your wingmen have made every effort not to destroy your target.  They will only attempt to disarm, thus making sure your target will no longer be able to attack you with any of its weapons."

813, "The next step will be to disable your target.  By giving this order to your wingmen, they will take out the engines of your target, thus disabling it from moving."

814, "You will once again bring up the messaging window by pressing the communications [$c$] key.  Next, select [2] for ''wing'', and [1] for ''Epsilon''.  Finally, press the [2] key to disable your target."

815, "As you can see, your wingmen are now taking out the engines of Freighter 01.  It won't take them long to knock out the engines of this freighter, but keep in mind that other targets can require many more hits to disable it than this freighter does."

816, "Now it's time to put that freighter out of its misery.  Order your wingmen to destroy the freighter."

817, "Well done pilot!"

818, "Press the communications [$c$] button to bring up the messaging window, followed by the [2] key to select a wing, then the [1] key to select Epsilon wing.  Finally press the [1] key to have them destroy your target."

819, "Well, how does it feel to have ordered your first kill?  Hope you enjoyed it because I want you to do it again."

820, "I want you to order Epsilon wing to destroy Freighter 02.  Have you remembered your previous instruction?  If you need to, you can look on your directives for previous instructions of this same goal."

821, "Nicely done Alpha 1.  I think you've got this down."

822, "OK pilot, now that you've had your fun I want to to order Epsilon wing to depart."

823, "All right pilot, now it's time to learn about countermeasures.  A countermeasure presents a new target for the pursuing missile to go after, thus causing the missile to avoid your ship.  As you will soon see this does not always work."

824, "For this lesson we are bringing in one of our Leviathan class cruisers.  Their gunner will be getting practice hitting a moving target, you.  Don't worry, these are just dummy missiles designed to give you a feel for live fire."

825, "In a few seconds the Neptune will begin to launch missiles at you.  Once the missiles are incoming, you will press the countermeasures [$x$] key to release your countermeasures."

826, "You should also immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum, and fly away from the pusuing missile.  In fact, you should be using your afterburners a great deal of the time."

827, "Then when the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile.  The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

828, "While you are launching your countermeasures, you will also try turning your ship about in sharp movements.  This will further help you to avoid being hit by the missile."

829, "That gives us just enough time to squeeze in one more lesson."

830, "It's time for you to reload your countermeasures.  To do this you will need to call in a support ship."

831, "In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your ship to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you.  Check your  indicator in the lower portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

832, "The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your ship with any secondary weapons and countermeasures."

833, "Finally, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to you ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem on your ship.  However, the support ship is not capable of repairing your main hull."

834, "All right pilot, now for a little more paractice with countermeasures.  The Neptune is going to fire at you again.  Take evasive actions."

835, "All right Pilot, I believe that will be enough for today.  The Neptune needs to continue its training elsewhere and you've had enough for one day.  You've done a good job, considering you're just a rookie.  Return to base."

836, "First, make sure that you still have Freighter 01 targeted."

837, "To do this, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

838, "Don't worry, the missiles being fired at you are not armed and will not harm you at all."

839, "You will use your afterburners to help maintain a high speed.  Additionally, you should try to keep the missile pointer at a 3 or 9 o'clock position."

840, "You will do this by pressing the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key for Rearm."

841, "Check your indicator in the lower central portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

842, "Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to fully reload you."

843, "When you have succesfully evaded a missile, an indicator will come up in the upper portion of your targeting reticle.  This will alert you to the fact that you indeed evaded the missile."

844, "Inability to follow instructions results in immediate failure.  Jump back to base to reschedule training phase one."

849, "In addition to the shield technology, the new Interceptor aspect seeking missiles is now available.  They are more powerful than the MX-50s, but require a lock before they may be fired.  You will learn how to properly use the Interceptor in this mission."

850, "The shield is an important addition to your ship, and the Interceptors are a formidable addition to your arsenal.  You must learn how to use them well."

851, "Congratulations.  You have completed your training."

868, "All right.  First we'll cover use of the aspect seeking Interceptor missiles.  Note that you are fully equipped with Interceptors."

869, "Unlike heat seeking missiles, such as the MX-50, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

870, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth this effort, as its homing ability is much stronger."

871, "Once fired, the aspect seeker will track its target anywhere in space.  Once the heat seeker loses track of its target, it is not likely to reacquire lock."

872, "Freighter 1 is now entering.  Let's see how you do with those Interceptors."

873, "Target the freighter. [Press $H$]"

874, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Diamond.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This indicates your Interceptors are locked and ready to fire."

875, "Now, fire one Interceptor at the freighter."

876, "Note how fast the Interceptor moves.  They also deliver quite a payload."

877, "Note that the Interceptor is nearly useless if fired before lock has been attained.  This is a crucial difference between the Interceptor and the MX-50."

878, "Now, target the Weapons subsystem on the freighter. [Press $S$ until targeted.]"

879, "Good.  Now, wait until you have attained lock on the Weapons subsystem."

880, "Now, fire your Interceptors until the Weapons subsystem has been destroyed."

881, "Well done.  Note your Interceptors will be effective in destroying subsystems on large targets."

882, "Now, unload your Interceptors until you've destroyed Freighter 1."

883, "Excellent job.  Now it's time to destroy some moving targets."

884, "A round of Interceptors can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

885, "Your ship is equipped with the new shielding technology.  It is able to absorb a large amount of incoming weapon energy."

886, "As the shield absorbs damage, it becomes weaker.  However, it automatically regenerates itself over time."

887, "Your shield integrity gauge is located at the lower right of your HUD.  It is flashing now."

888, "Your shield is divided into four quadrants, each able to withstand a certain amount of damage."

889, "When a quadrant of your shield suffers damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

890, "Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken damage."

891, "Note how the gauge changes as your shield takes more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage will pass through to the underlying hull."

892, "Note that your shield automatically recharges over time.  I will accelerate this process to save time."

893, "Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

894, "Now your shield has recharged back to full strength.  Next we'll cover shield management."

895, "There are a number of ways you can manage your shield.  The simplest is the Equalize Quadrants function."

896, "Well done.  Note that your front section has been largely recharged.  This came at the expense of shield energy from the three other quadrants."

897, "I have damaged your front shield quadrant again.  Now use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your front quadrant.  [Press $q$]"

898, "I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero strength."

899, "Now you'll learn how to maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

900, "First, you'll maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]"

901, "Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the others were drained."

902, "Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking a large ship against its turret fire."

903, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

904, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can be very useful."

905, "Well done, Pilot.  Aspect seeking missiles are an important part of your arsenal.  Use them well."

906, "And proper shield management can make all the difference in a crucial battle."

907, "This concludes your training.  Return to base."

908, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed location inside your HUD reticle."

909, "I will now call in fighter drones.  When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock.  Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

910, "Once you have acquired lock, fire an Interceptor to destroy the drone.  Note, these drones will not be using countermeasures."

911, "Well done.  Now let's try something a little more difficult.  Wings of two drones will appear at once.  Destroy them all."

912, "All right.  Now we'll move on to your shield system."

913, "Note that you'll need to be in range of these drones before you can gain aspect lock.  Fly towards them."

921, "At the end of your watch, you will be relieved by $f Delta wing.  Upon $f Delta's arrival, you are to return to base."

922, "Your primary objective will be to protect the $f Orff until the end of your watch.  We expect you to carry out your orders to the letter."

There is no place for you in the GTA.  You are dismissed."

925, "If you kill the Vasudan fighters before they reach the Orff, they will not be able to harm it.  Concentrate on one fighter at a time.  When it's destroyed, move to the next.  After Delta wing arrives, you may return to base."

926, "You did a fine job on your first watch, Pilot.  Your strong sense of duty will serve the Alliance well.

The presence of Vasudans in this system gives us little reason to worry.  The ships that attacked you and the Orff were probably remnants of the Vasudan convoy that we hit last week."

927, "Your performance was excellent.  We have no recommendations for you."

928, "Despite your efforts, Vasudan fighters escaped from the system.

If we allow them to elude us, pilot, we appear weak.  We won't tolerate this sort of embarrassment again."

929, "If you are having trouble killing the Vasudans, try launching missiles.  MX-50s automatically seek out a hostile target if it is within range.  After Delta arrives, you can still help them out by destroying more Vasudans."

930, "We are saddened to learn of Lieutenant Harbison's demise.  He was a brave and skillful pilot.  A memorial service will be held at 0930.  You are ordered to attend."

931, "Next time, try to ensure the safety of your wingmen.  If he requests help, engage the ship that's attacking him."

932, "You left the field of battle before your watch was ended.  This act of cowardice will stain your record for the rest of your military career.

If you can prevent that rendezvous, we'll send in marines in troop transports to capture the freighters and rescue the hostages."

1281, "You conquered three phases of Terran fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  In time, we will expect you to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Good job."

1286, "The Omen and the Hoyle are in the Hellfire's path.  We have sent in all forces but it has not been slowed down."

1287, "The Hellfire was destroyed and both science facilities are still intact.  Great job."

1288, "Both science facilities were destroyed but at least the Hellfire was stopped."

1289, "The Omen was destroyed but the Hoyle was salvaged.  We haven't lost all of our science outposts just yet."

1302, "The Ptolemy was destroyed.  This is a major loss to the Hammer of Light, and a major victory for allied forces."

1303, "The Gateway was destroyed as well.  Good job."

1304, "You allowed all of the escape pods to depart.  Some of the Ptolemy's command staff may have been evacuated.  We are sending fighters to hunt down these pods as we speak."

1313, "Welcome to the GTI

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.  You are now assigned to the GTI's Special Ops destroyer, the Krios.

The primary mission of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of our enemies, specifically the Shivans and the Vasudan insurgency, Hammer of Light.

As a pilot for Special Ops, your missions will involve intelligence gathering and containment.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

1314, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.

We have no word on what became of the Terran pilots that destroyed the Lucifer, or how much of the attack force remains stranded on the Earth side of the node.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth and GTA HQ, an interim GTA Command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

1315, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVN has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.  Furthermore, incidents of violence between Terran and Vasudan military personnel have compounded an already precarious situation."

1316, "Overzealous Pilots

The GTA and the PVN are conducting joint operations in the Vega system.  Though hostilities between allied forces in Vega have been confined to isolated episodes, tensions have now escalated to an all-out confrontation.  During a recent Shivan attack, Terran pilots fired upon Vasudan ships with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the PVN learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the Shivans will soon collapse."

1317, "Mission Classified

This mission has been classified at the highest level.  If you should be killed or captured while fulfilling your objectives, GTI will disavow any knowledge of you or your actions."

1318, "New Technology: Leech Cannon

The secondary mission of the GTI is the research and development of cutting-edge technologies.  As a Special Ops officer, you will have access to advanced weapons and warship prototypes not yet available to GTA pilots.  These systems have undergone extensive lab and field testing and should function as designed.

The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the Leech Cannon to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

1319, "At approximately 1530 hours, Terran and Vasudan fighters repelled a Shivan assault against Outpost Fermi.  During the skirmish, Terran pilots fired on our Vasudan allies with intent to kill."

1320, "The motives of these pilots are unclear.  We do not believe their actions represent a large-scale insurrection within Terran ranks, but the situation must be contained."

1321, "Hostilities have escalated to an all-out confrontation between Terran and Vasudan forces in the area.  A GTI communications terminal in the sector transmitted an encoded message advising command of the situation, which threatens to jeopardize our treaty with the Vasudans."

1322, "Your objective will be to sanitize the area.  Destroy everything but the GTI communications terminal.  All voices must be silenced to preserve the Terran-Vasudan alliance."

1323, "This mission has an operational window of five minutes.  Get in.  Do your job.  Get out.  Good luck, pilot."

1324, "Well done, pilot.  You executed a clean sweep of the area and contained a volatile incident.  A single Vasudan ship escaped, but the GTI will soon liquidate this threat."

1325, "The transport that escaped was too far away from you to be eliminated."

1326, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  This failure will give GTA sufficient evidence to reconstruct the incident.  You have compromised the Terran-Vasudan alliance, and GTA has severed its support of our operations.  You are grounded permanently."

1327, "Destroy all targets within your five-minute window."

1328, "You failed to silence the Vasudan transport.  You have compromised the Terran-Vasudan alliance, and GTA has severed its support of our operations.  You are grounded until further notice."

1329, "Destroy the transport.  Perhaps deploy Beta wing to complete this task while you and Alpha wing engage the other vessels."

1330, "Two targets escaped.  GTI tracked and silenced the first vessel, but the second evaded our forces and informed the Vasudans of our operation.  Your failure has jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans.  You are grounded until further notice."

1331, "Be aware of the positions of all ships in the area.  You cannot afford to let any escape."

1332, "Destroy all witnesses"

1339, "Alpha 1, containment critical.  Aries 2 breaking for the jump node."

1340, "Aries 3 en route to terminal.  Destroy Aries 3, Alpha 1.  Let's keep the Vasudan armada out of this."

1341, "What is going on here pilot?"

1342, "Alpha 1, this mission has been compromised.  Return to base."

1343, "The Pursuit"

1344, "A Vasudan ship, designated Aries 2, escaped our containment operation.  GTI has tracked the vessel to a Vasudan-controlled supply zone."

1345, "Aries 2 has communicated our objectives to Vasudan forces in that sector.  We are jamming all local transmissions, but we must achieve absolute containment."

1346, "Your mission will be to destroy all vessels in the supply zone.  Ignore the cargo.  Preliminary reconnaissance indicates a garrison of two Aten cruisers with fighter escort."

1347, "The loss of innocent lives is regrettable but necessary to preserve the Terran-Vasudan alliance and defeat the Shivans.  You must not fail."

1348, "Excellent work.  You defeated superior forces that intelligence failed to anticipate.  The science vessel's escape pods survived the assault, but GTI will track and eliminate them.  Analysis indicates you had no choice but to avoid the shock wave of the blast.  You exercised good judgment under fire, pilot."

1349, "In order for you to survive you had to leave the escape pods be.  There was no way you could destroy the escape pods and live."

1350, "Aborting a mission without orders is insubordination, pilot.  You will have an opportunity to explain these actions at your court martial tomorrow, at 0800 hours."

1351, "Never abort a mission unless ordered to do so."

1352, "Destroy all enemies"

1353, "Destroy Einstein"

1358, "Alpha 1, move away from the Einstein!  Sensors reading massive energy surge!"

1359, "Ghosts"

1360, "GTI has located the Einstein's escape pods in the Beta Aquilae sector."

1361, "Command has issued a new directive.  Your mission will be to secure the area and guard the pods.  A retrieval ship will recover the survivors for interrogation."

1362, "We will deploy the retrieval ship as soon as possible.  Defend those pods until you are relieved of duty.  You will receive further orders in Beta Aquilae."

1363, "The incident at Beta Aquilae has us puzzled.  Command acknowledges you had no means of confirming the authorization status of the destroyer.  Under these circumstances, you did excellent work ensuring the recovery of an escape pod."

1364, "Only one escape pod can be rescued in this mission."

1365, "You are grounded until further notice, pilot.  With none of the survivors in our custody, our intelligence efforts are futile."

1366, "Monitor the status of the escape pods."

1367, "You aborted your mission before completion.  You will be required to provide full testimony before a court martial.  Dismissed."

1368, "Escort Einstein Vessels"

1369, "Escort escape pods until retrieval"

1370, "Escape pods, listen up.  Alpha will escort you until the retrieval ship gets here.  If you do not comply, they have orders to open fire."

1372, "Pods, stay clear.  We'll handle this."

1373, "Alpha 1, preparing for pod retrieval.  Maintain escort.  Deploying reinforcements to assist."

1374, "Sucker punch!  Breaking to attack!"

1375, "Alpha 1, this is GTI cruiser Myrmidon.  Deployed for pod retrieval.  What's your status here?"

1376, "Alpha 1, this is Myrmidon.  Pod retrieved.  Returning to base."

1377, "Mission accomplished, Alpha 1.  Bring it on home."

1378, "Sensor malfunction!  Can't read those fighters!"

1379, "On The Run"

1380, "Unknown Fighters

A preliminary analysis of the incident at Beta Aquilae suggests the fighters you engaged possessed advanced stealth technologies.  The origin and intent of this force remain unknown, and Terran Command has ordered a full investigation.  You will be informed of the progress of this inquiry on a need-to-know basis.  Until further notice, you have been reassigned to other GTI operations."

1381, "New Technology: Zeus Bomber

GTI research and development has completed field testing of the Zeus-class strike bomber.  Like the Athena, its predecessor, the Zeus offers excellent speed and maneuverability.  However, more efficient design enables the Zeus to carry Tsunami space bombs in its arsenal.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against Shivan capital ships."

1382, "New Technology: Cluster Bomb

A second-generation Synaptic bomb, GTI's cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against groups or wings of enemy ships.  Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a field of energy blasts, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

1383, "A Shivan offensive has decimated our forces in the Ikeya system.  The enemy annihilated our installations and eighty percent of the fleet garrisoned in that sector.  The survivors are now retreating to secure Terran positions."

1384, "Fortunately, the science cruiser Ratna survived the engagement.  Scientists on board this vessel are spearheading the Eumenides Project and have developed cutting-edge weapon prototypes vital to the war effort."

1385, "The Shivans disabled the Ratna, so the vessel has neither propulsion nor warp capability.  We must retrieve our ship, its scientists, and their prototypes.  Command anticipates Shivan reinforcements will soon resume their offensive."

1386, "Under these circumstances, we must execute a high-risk maneuver to recover the Ratna.  Vasudan transport Gemini will dock with the vessel and tow it away from the Shivan attack point.  The docking seal may not hold, but we have no other viable options."

1387, "Command will deploy additional Terran transports to evacuate the scientists.  We cannot extract the prototypes from the Ratna, so the entire vessel must be recovered."

1388, "Your mission: protect the Ratna.  Repel the Shivan attack so repair crews can get the engines back on line.  The future of this war is in your hands, pilot."

1389, "You held off the enemy so our transports could evacuate the scientists.  We need their expertise to win this war, pilot.  Good work."

1390, "Well done."

1391, "Because of your outstanding performance, we recovered the Ratna and its prototypes.  You should be very proud, pilot.  You saved not only the Eumenides Project but possibly the lives of millions."

1392, "You failed to provide our transports with adequate fighter cover.  As a result, we could neither evacuate the scientists nor retrieve the prototypes.  Technology will win this war, not mediocrity.  Knowledge is power, pilot, and you're flying unarmed.  Dismissed."

1393, "You must keep the enemy fighters away from the Ratna."

1394, "We evacuated our scientists.  However, without the prototypes, Command has terminated the Eumenides Project.  There are no commendations for mediocrity, pilot.  Dismissed."

1409, "Hellfire consists of four cruisers, both Cain and Lilith class, with a fighter escort of ten to fifteen ships."

1410, "Your squad will intercept and destroy as much of the Shivan force as possible.  Beta and Delta will engage the cruisers.  Alpha and Gamma will defend the bomber wings and neutralize the fighter threat."

1411, "Well done, pilot.  Because the Shivan cruisers failed to reach the Delta Serpentis jump node, we anticipate a decisive victory for our forces in that sector."

1412, "You successfully destroyed Hellfire's fighter escort."

1413, "We're at war pilot.  This is no training mission.  Hellfire reached the Delta Serpentis jump node and reinforced the primary Shivan fleet.  Your failure cost us lives and resources we could not afford to lose."

1425, "Should Epsilon 1 fail to accomplish its objective, we will deploy Epsilon 2.  If neither transport succeeds in recovering the Giordano, your orders are to destroy the station and return to base."

1426, "Excellent work.  We recovered the Giordano and its data with only minimal losses."

1427, "Your mission was a success.  We lost Epsilon 1, but recovered the Giordano and its data."

1428, "Your efforts have prevented a critical breach in GTI security.  However, we regret the loss of the Giordano."

1429, "Use some wingmen to protect the transports, and disable the forward turrets of the Ptah."

1430, "The transports failed to recover the Giordano.  The Hammer of Light now has access to data that will compromise GTI operations.  Your gross incompetence has forced command to abort several key missions.  Dismissed, pilot."

1439, "GTI must capture mining materials necessary for the war effort in the middle of an ionized field."

1440, "Unknown Fighters

During recovery of the Einstein's escape pods in Beta Aquilae, unidentified fighters attacked your wing.  The results of our inquiry are puzzling-the vessels are Loki-class fighters, GTI design and manufacture.

GTI research and development created the Loki-class fighter at a top-secret installation, location undisclosed.  The prototype of a stealth fighter project, the Loki is designed to elude detection by all known sensor arrays."

1441, "Unknown Fighters

Analysis of the Beta Aquilae attack has enabled our engineers to exploit a structural weakness in the Loki, thus rendering its stealth technology useless.  We have shared this information with our Vasudan allies, and we anticipate the Shivans will also have the expertise to uncloak the fighter.

The incident does signal an even more disturbing development, however: the emergence of a rogue element within the GTI.  We suspect an insurgent cell has appropriated the Loki for unknown purposes.  However, the secrecy surrounding the stealth project has impeded further inquiry."

1442, "The Einstein

The appearance of the Einstein in the Vega System is also troubling.

According to service logs, the Einstein was destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128, in which the enemy annihilated all Terran ships and installations.  The Einstein had entered the system to conduct a routine geological survey three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Vega during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

1443, "Ross 128

Furthermore, evidence suggests the Einstein may have been a rogue GTI ship.  A high-ranking GTI operative, Captain Ezra Tycho, commanded the science vessel.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.  Analyzing the data we have gathered so far, we believe rogue elements within the GTI may have known about the existence of the Shivan threat prior to the attack on Ross 128."

1444, "Rogue Elements

Therefore, we suspect the Loki-class fighters were engaged in a GTI cover-up.  The attack on your wing in the Beta Aquilae system may have been a botched attempt to destroy evidence of the Einstein's existence.

The extent of the cover-up and the objectives of the conspiracy remain unknown.  You are advised to exercise caution during your next sorties."

1445, "New Technology: Loki Fighter

The latest prototype developed by the GTI stealth project, the Loki features high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability.  Because of a minor structural weakness, the Loki's stealth capability has been compromised.  Nevertheless, the Loki is the most versatile fighter in our arsenal."

1446, "New Technology: S-Breaker

Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon will be effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim.

Use it well."

1447, "Pirates have attacked the Talus Mining Facility.  Because this installation processes materials critical to our warhead production, control of Talus is of the utmost strategic importance."

1448, "The facility's garrison repelled the pirate attack but sustained ninety percent casualties.  Certain volatile materials breached containment during the engagement, and the resulting explosion annihilated the pirate force.  However, the blast also severely compromised the structural integrity of the installation."

1449, "Your primary objective will be to escort our transports while they recover the remaining warhead materials."

1450, "Be advised the explosion released an ionized gas that will render small vessels invisible to sensors.  This will make missile lock impossible on targets within the ionized zone."

1451, "Once the operation has commenced, the facility will begin its evacuation.  However, the cargo must be your first priority.  Only after the materials have been recovered should you protect the escape pods.  We regret any casualties that may result, but the strategic value of the warhead materials necessitates this decision."

1452, "Command will deploy bombers to destroy the facility after all materials and survivors have been recovered."

1453, "Because of heavy subspace activity in the area, we should anticipate a Shivan attack against our operation."

1454, "Well done, pilot.  You ensured the retrieval of all warhead materials and saved the lives of facility personnel."

1455, "Good work, pilot.  You ensured the retrieval of all warhead materials from the Talus Mining Facility."

1456, "You had strict orders, pilot.  Your actions may have seemed humane, but many more lives will be lost without those warhead materials.  Command has no use for pilots who disregard its directives."

1457, "Defend the survivors only after the cargo has been recovered successfully."

1458, "Because of your ineptitude, the pirates now possess critical warhead materials and weapon prototypes.  Furthermore, this catastrophe has bolstered the enemy's morale.  Command anticipates their attacks against our positions will intensify."

1459, "You can defeat the pirates.  Pay attention to where they are going and where they are coming from."

1460, "You skillfully thwarted the pirate assault.  You did well to monitor the status of the transports to prevent materials from falling into enemy hands.  Analysis suggests the pirates no longer pose any viable threat to our military ships and installations."

1461, "Without those materials and prototypes, our capacity to wage war against the Shivans has been compromised.  What happened out there, pilot?  Was it incompetence...or treason?"

To obliterate data gathered about its activities in the Ross 128 system, Galactic Terran Intelligence destroyed the Krios.  Effectively immediately, all surviving personnel are to be reassigned to the GTD Soyakaze."

1517, "The GTI

The conspiracy is not confined to a rogue element within the GTI, but involves officers in the highest echelon of the intelligence directorate.  Although their objectives remain unclear, Command believes the conspirators intend to overthrow the GTA government and dissolve the Terran-Vasudan Treaty.

Galatic Terran Intelligence-its ships, installations, and personnel-are now hostile targets.  Because of the  technology and sensitive information within its grasp, the GTI poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the GTA, the PVN, and all allied worlds.  Our actions must be swift and decisive.

The Soyakaze's primary objective is to locate and destroy the GTI's base of operations."

1518, "Ross 128

The Soyakaze has set course for the Ross 128 system.  Information recovered from the Krios indicates GTI operations are concentrated around the site of the initial Shivan attack.  Our first task will be to investigate this activity."

1519, "Admiral Scott

I will now take this opportunity to honor the late Admiral Scott, commander of the GTD Krios, who died in the line of duty.

Admiral Scott devoted many years of service to the GTI and dedicated himself to its mission: to provide the GTA and its allies with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of its enemies.

His superiors, to whom he had given his trust and loyalty, betrayed Admiral Scott when they abandoned that mission to pursue their corrupt ambitions and designs.  GTI is now the enemy.

Let us never forget the integrity and sacrifice of this fine officer."

1520, "New Technology: EM Pulse Missile

Without the technology and expertise of GTI's research and development branch, we will lack our enemy's cutting-edge weapon systems and ship prototypes.  However, we do have a new addition to the arsenal: the EM Pulse missile.

Upon impact, the EM Pulse disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  The weapon has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also reacquire their target's signature lock."

1521, "We have set course for Ross 128, the site of the first Shivan contact.  GTI operatives have been active in this system, and we must investigate.  Your mission will be to inspect the wreckage from the original Shivan assault."

1522, "Ross 128 is currently under Shivan control.  There are no other Terran forces in this system.  You will need to complete your mission quickly.  Scan the wreckage and return to base."

1523, "Your wing annihilated all GTI vessels.  Fine work.  We suspect the GTI already salvaged the wreckage at Ross 128.  Their objectives in this sector remain unknown."

1524, "We made no strategic gains at Ross 128, but your assault decimated the Shivan garrison.  Nice work."

1525, "Use the Shivans to your advantage against the GTI."

1526, "Elements of the Shivan force escaped.  I should not have to remind you that destroying all hostiles is a high priority.  Winning the battle means nothing if we lose the war."

1527, "Destroy Vishnu"

1531, "Sensors indicate Terran configurations.  Request immediate verification.  We're the only Terran presence confirmed in this area."

1532, "Terran vessels are GTI ships.  Engage and destroy all hostiles - GTI and Shivan."

1533, "Hostiles have been neutralized, but sensors are unable to locate wreckage for scanning.  Abort mission and return to base."

1534, "The Wait"

1535, "Reconnaissance reports heavy Shivan traffic through the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Our mission: shut them down."

1536, "Your wing will patrol this area and engage any hostiles.  Seek and destroy."

1537, "You had orders not to destroy the cargo, pilot.  Either you're a slow learner or you're shooting for demotion.  Intelligence needed that cargo for analysis."

1538, "Disable the freighters first, then destroy them after eliminating the other hostiles."

1539, "The Shivans escaped with their cargo.  Apparently their freighters were too fast and maneuverable for you, pilot.  Command is unimpressed with your lack of results."

1540, "Our freighters retrieved the Shivan cargo.  Well done.  Intelligence has begun its analysis, and we hope to learn much about Shivan strategy in this sector."

1541, "We failed to recover all the cargo, but we have sufficient evidence to uncover the Shivan's objective in this sector."

1549, "Command says Shivans have been swarming all over this node."

1550, "Engage and destroy Shivan freighters.  Do not, repeat, do not destroy the cargo.  We will commence retrieval once the area is secured."

1551, "Deploying freighters Priam, Hector, and Paris to retrieve the cargo."

1552, "The freighters can take it from here.  Return to base."

1553, "Alpha, stop wasting time and return to base"

1554, "Back off!  That cruiser's gonna blow!"

1555, "Secrets Revealed"

1556, "GTI Headquarters

We have located the GTI's base of operations- the Jotunheim installation in the Beta Aquilae system.

The full extent of their activities in Beta Aquilae remain unknown.  However, we believe the GTI has been studying Shivan culture and technology at Jotunheim since the massacre at Ross 128."

1557, "GTI Plans

Reconnaissance also has evidence of a large-scale prototype construction involving Shivan technology, but no data regarding the configuration and capability of this vessel could be gathered."

1558, "GTI Technology

GTI forces have access to Shivan armaments as well as the systems created by its research and development branch, so be advised your foe will possess superior technology.  You will have to fly smarter and fight harder to win this battle.

Command suspects the GTI may also have Shivan captives at Jotunheim for the purposes of biological research and the development of viral weapons."

1559, "Hades

Terran Command intercepted a GTI transmission and technical readout relating to a Jotunheim operation with the codename Project Hades.  Cryptographers are in the process of deciphering the transmission, and engineers are analyzing the technical readout.  Although we have nothing conclusive, we must act now."

1560, "Our Mission

The rogue Galactic Terran Intelligence group must be crushed.  These traitors threaten the security of the GTA, the stability of the Terran-Vasudan Alliance, and our future victory over the Shivans.  Report for your mission briefing, pilot."

1561, "Reconnaissance has uncovered the location of GTI's primary base of operations, the Jotunheim.  Details concerning the strength of the garrison remain sketchy.  GTA will launch an immediate, all-out offensive and deploy reinforcements as soon as possible."

1562, "Failure is not an option.  The GTI conducts weapons research on the Jotunheim, so be prepared to engage exotic prototypes with unknown capabilities."

1563, "Your cowardice jeopardized our best opportunity to eliminate the GTI threat.  Once operational, the Shivan-Terran hybrid will be invincible.  Dismissed, pilot."

1564, "Protect your bombers and keep your wingmen focused."

1565, "Excellent work!  Our initiative caught the GTI off guard.  Preliminary scans indicate the GTI possessed Shivan defensive technologies.  If that juggernaut had gone on line, GTI would be writing the history books."

1566, "For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of your own life, you have distinguished yourself above and beyond the call of duty in the highest traditions of military service.  You are hereby awarded the Galactic Service Medal, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the Galactic Terran Alliance."

1567, "That sucked, didn't it?  Well, if you share our feelings that Silent Threat had potential that it never managed to live up to, then you might like to try Silent Threat: Reborn.  ST:R is the Port team's reimagined and reinterpreted version of Silent Threat, with improved missions, a deeper plot, more immersion, and plenty of ties to FreeSpace 2!

1584, "Terran Command has initiated Operation Fury, a renewed offensive against Shivan positions in the Capella system.  Phase 1: eliminate all hostiles and secure the Vega system.  Reconnaissance has located a Hammer of Light cruiser group, comprised of two Aten-class warships, en route to the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Our task force has been deployed to engage and destroy this threat.  The Fenris-class Mjollnir and the Leviathan-class Dionysos will provide support for the assault."

1585, "Sensors indicate a Terran cruiser group on intercept course.  Engage and destroy the Mjollnir and Dionysos warships."

1586, "Our task force secured the Vega system, and Command has issued the go-ahead for Phase 2 of Operation Fury.  Excellent work, pilot."

1587, "You destroyed only one Aten warship.  Command has suspended Operation Fury until a more proficient force can secure the Vega system.  Anything less than total victory is unacceptable."

1588, "Guard your bombers and keep your wingmen focused."

1589, "Because of your failure, Command has scrapped Operation Fury.  With officers like you, the alliance needs no enemies."

1590, "Hammer of Light destroyed the Mjollnir and the Dionysos.  You are grounded pending a full investigation.  Dismissed, pilot."

1591, "Excellent work, pilot.  You destroyed the Mjollnir and the Dionysos."

1592, "A Terran warship survived the battle.  You failed to destroy both cruisers."

1593, "The Mjollnir and the Dionysos survived the battle.  You failed to destroy the Terran cruisers."

GTI scientists are now in the process of developing a warhead-viable containment system for the Serkr's volatile core."

1602, "Your objective is to destroy the Ragnarok and its Orion-class escort, the Heimdall.  For the sake of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, the Serkr project must be terminated."

1603, "Outstanding, pilot!  You destroyed the Ragnarok and the Heimdall.  Your efforts have terminated the GTI's Serkr project."

1604, "You destroyed the Ragnarok and terminated the GTI's Serkr project.  Command regrets you failed to eliminate the Heimdall, but you achieved your primary objective."

1605, "You are a disgrace, pilot.  The Ragnarok and the Heimdall escaped.  If GTI succeeds in stabilizing the Serkr warhead, every capital ship in the Terran-Vasudan alliance will be at risk.  Dismissed."

1615, "Terran intelligence has received the coordinates of the Apophis, a Hammer of Light Typhon-class destroyer.  Your mission: ambush and obliterate this vessel."

1616, "The commander of the Apophis is Admiral Kek, the highest-ranking officer to defect since the formation of the Terran-Vasudan alliance and the HOL insurgency."

1617, "Deep-cover Vasudan operatives within Hammer of Light have advised intelligence of the destroyer's location.  Because we are the alliance force in closest proximity to these coordinates, command has ordered the GTD Hephaestus to launch an immediate attack."

1618, "The Epona has also been deployed to assist and will reinforce our assault once the cruiser is in position."

1619, "Expect to encounter heavy resistance.  Admiral Kek inspires absolute loyalty in his followers.  We must be willing to make any sacrifice necessary to destroy the Apophis."

1620, "Excellent work, pilot.  You destroyed the Apophis, and the GTD Hephaestus sustained only minor damage.  Command anticipates the death of Admiral Kek will undermine the morale and strategic leadership of Hammer of Light."

1621, "You eliminated Admiral Kek and his capital ship.  However, the GTD Hephaestus sustained heavy damage.  Extensive repairs will be required before we bring the ship back on line.  This may compromise allied operations in this sector."

1622, "Use some wingmen to defend the Hephaestus."

1623, "Command deeply regrets the loss of the GTD Hephaestus and its crew.  However, our task force accomplished its objective.  With the death of Admiral Kek and the destruction of the Apophis, the alliance has achieved a significant victory over Hammer of Light."

1624, "Command has ordered court-martial proceedings, pilot.  What should have been a triumph for the alliance resulted in humiliating defeat.  Admiral Kek and the Apophis destroyed the GTD Hephaestus and escaped."

The Vasudan ship has sustained minor damage, but the Shivans have them outgunned.  Our mission: destroy the hostiles and save the Vasudan cruiser."

1632, "You saved the PVD Serket and obliterated the Shivans.  The Serket was able to complete its operations in the Deneb system, and the Vasudan admiralty has extended its gratitude.  Well done, pilot."

1633, "You neutralized the Shivan cruiser group, but the PVD Serket was destroyed.  Command has sent its regrets to the Vasudan admiralty.  Dismissed, pilot."

1634, "Use some wingmen to defend the Serket."

1635, "You are an embarrassment to the Terran fleet, pilot.  The Shivan destroyer vaporized the PVD Serket and escaped.  This failure may damage our alliance with the Vasudans, and you are grounded until further notice.  Dismissed."

1641, "There are 3 subspace nodes in this sector.  They lead to Vasuda, Aldebaran, and Sirius.  Civilians will be transported from Vasuda to Aldebaran."

1642, "Our warships will travel to and from both the Sirius and Vasuda jump points."

1643, "Because of the strategic importance of this system, we expect the Shivans to try to secure it quickly.  You will ensure the safe passage of all Allied vessels in the area.  Additional orders will be sent to you as they arise."

1644, "You did an outstanding job in protecting our transports.  We were able to save countless lives.  You should feel proud of this accomplishment."

1645, "You were also able to keep the area secured until we established a stronger foothold in the system.  Well done."

1646, "Far too many ships were lost in this evacuation operation.  This is a great blow to our people.  It is unfortunate that you were unable to do more to help those refugees."

1647, "Protect all of the ships in the area.  Make sure every group of ships is protected by either you or your wingmen.  Kill the bombers as fast as possible with your hornets."

1648, "However, we were not able to secure the area because you left your post before you were relieved."

1649, "Remain in the area until Zeta arrives to relieve you.  If worse comes to worse, Delta wing is available for reinforcements."

1650, "You were also unable to secure the area against future Shivan attacks.  It will be very difficult to retake this sector of space."

1651, "Remain in the area until Zeta wing has arrived to relieve you.  If you are having difficulty staying alive that long, make sure you manage your shields well.  If worse comes to worse, you may call in Delta wing to assist you."

1652, "What we are most impressed with, however, is your protection of each and every ship.  We did not lose a single freighter or transport, and the Mecross is safe from Shivan bombers.

This is truly an amazing accomplishment, and for this we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

1653, "It is unfortunate that the Mecross was destroyed during the battle.  Her loss is keenly felt.  We realize the odds were stacked against you, and we do not hold you responsible."

1654, "The Mecross can be saved.  Try to kill the Nephilims as fast as you can.  Also make sure you shoot down any incoming bombs.  Save your hornets if possible and use them as soon as you get a lock."

1655, "We did lose a few refugee ships during this evacuation operation."

1656, "Saving every ship requires good communication.  Make sure every ship is always guarded by you or your wingmen.  Use your hornets on bombers and don't let them get too close to the freighters.  Make sure all of your wingmen are always doing something."

1657, "We are pleased you were able to use Delta wing to accomplish all of your objectives.  However, you should try to keep your use of reinforcements at a minimum.  If every wing leader requested reinforcements at every opportunity, we would run out of fighters."

1705, "We are the last wing available to help cover the Hope while it is being repaired.  The Terrans are sending a few of their own fighters to stand guard over the Hope, but it will be some time before they arrive."

1706, "We do not believe the Shivans have enough forces in the system to mount a serious attack, but their strategies are difficult to predict.  Good luck."

1707, "Well done, Pilot.  This mission was quite a bit more intense than we had expected, thanks to the Shivans.  Fortunately you were able to hang on until the reinforcements arrived.  Very impressive."

1708, "For protecting one of the few remaining Vasudan Typhon-class destroyers, you are awarded the medal of Conspicuous Gallantry.  Wear it proudly."

1709, "You failed to protect the Hope.  Even though we were not expecting an attack from the Shivans, you needed to protect that ship.  Due to your failure, our hold on this sector becomes even more tenuous.  We all have to perform beyond our abilities in this war, Pilot.  Dismissed!"

1742, "Fortunately you were able to save some of the escape pods.  The survivors thank you and look forward to the chance to avenge the destruction of the Aquilae."

1743, "Protecting all the escape pods is most impressive.  The survivors thank you and hope we can avenge the destruction of the Aquilae."

1744, "By protecting the Beta Aquilae Communications Terminal we are able to keep in contact with our forces in the outer systems.  Losing the communication terminal would have been a severe blow.  Well done pilot.

For continued service to the Alliance, we are awarding you the Good Conduct Medal.  Keep it up."

1745, "We lost many escape pods in the battle as well.  Such a loss of life is difficult to bear.  Several key scientists were unable to evacuate the installation.  They, and their research, will be sorely missed."

1746, "You should try to stay near the escape pods and destroy any shivan fighters that attack them.  Sacrificing one or two pods so the rest can make it is a wise choice which you may have to make."

1771, "The Zenith is currently on patrol with just two wings of Shivan fighters, the Arjuna interceptors, and the Rama superiority fighters.  However, we believe they are able to call in reinforcements."

1772, "Your primary objective will be to destroy the Zenith.  Take out the Zenith's communications system first to prevent it from calling in reinforcements.  If you're unable to do that, go after all weapons systems, including turrets and missile launchers."

1773, "Alpha wing will provide cover for the bombers.  Gamma wing will assist Alpha and will attempt to take out the communications system on Zenith.  Beta will be equipped with Tsunami bombs, and will be targeting suspected weak points on the Zenith's hull."

1774, "You failed to destroy the Zenith.  We will have quite a bit of difficulty continuing this operation."

1775, "If you can't beat the Zenith, try to first eliminate all Dragons in the area, then go straight for the Zenith's comms.  Once the comms are out, target the weapons system and then allow your bombers to finish him off."

1776, "Congratulations on destroying the Zenith.  It is now time to begin the next stage of this operation."

1794, "Omega wing will dock with the Rosetta as soon as they arrive.  Oversee this personnel transfer, then escort Omega 1 and Omega 2 to the jump node."

1795, "You managed to get both transports to the Altair system.  If the information at Altair IV proves as valuable as the Vasudan refugees suspect, then the Terran and Vasudan people will owe you a great debt.  Well done, pilot."

1796, "A crucial transport was lost.  We hope the one that managed to get through will be adequate to recover the information from Altair IV.  We relied on you to safeguard the transit of the scientists and you were only marginally successful.  We expect better in the future."

1797, "Forget Rosetta.  Getting those two transports out alive is far more important.  You have to take out those heavy attack basilisks as fast as possible, before they launch their streams of swarm missiles."

1798, "Both transports were destroyed.  You were entrusted with a mission of enormous importance and you failed.  Dismissed."

1799, "Forget Rosetta.  Concentrate on saving those transports.  Kill the Basilisks as fast as possible unless you want Omega to eat all kinds of missiles for dinner.  Make sure all your wingmen are under your control.  You need to make sure every fighter is doing its job."

1800, "The crew of the Rosetta sends their thanks.  When the Lucifer jumped in, they all but gave up hope of survival.  Your squadron was able to hold off the enemy and that is most impressive.  For this, you are awarded the Commendation Medal."

1825, "Unfortunately, the Altair system is still controlled by the Hammer of Light.  One of their flagships, the Anvil, is stationed here, and has gotten word of our presence in this system.  It is currently blocking the vector to the subspace node."

1826, "The Anvil carries with it a powerful contingent of Vasudan fighters.  Intelligence reports two squadrons: one of advanced Thoth space superiority fighters, and one of Horus Interceptors.  These fighters have defended the Anvil well."

1827, "Intelligence has also detected the presence of a third wing of Vasudan bombers in the system.  They will undoubtedly try to attack our fleeing transports."

1828, "Intelligence has also detected the presence of a third wing of Vasudan bombers in the system.  They will undoubtedly try to attack our fleeing transport."

1829, "Your strike force will once again consist of Alpha, Beta and Gamma wings.  Gamma will provide escort for Alpha while Alpha attacks the Anvil.  Beta will ensure the safety of the transports and maintain our fighter superiority."

1830, "The Anvil must be destroyed.  We are equipping Alpha with Harbinger bombs.  These bombs require exact placement and careful maneuvering, but will do massive damage to the Anvil.  Beta and Gamma must ensure that the Harbingers reach their target."

1831, "Our primary goal, however, is to ensure that Omega 1 and Omega 2 reach the jump node.  Destroying the Anvil is the best way to ensure that this goal is accomplished.  This mission is of grave importance.  Do not fail, Pilot.  Good luck."

1832, "Our primary goal, however, is to ensure that Omega 1 reaches the jump node.  Destroying the Anvil is the best way to ensure that this goal is accomplished.  This mission is of grave importance.  Do not fail, Pilot.  Good luck."

There is nothing we can do from here.
Dismissed."

1834, "If worse comes to worst, let Omega 2 die, and go straight for the Leo bombers.  Once you've destroyed the Leos, you can simply order everyone to engage fighters, and you should have little trouble escorting Omega 1 to the jump node."

1835, "Mission accomplished, Pilot.  We haven't yet been briefed on the full importance of the ancient records, but Terran Command is extremely pleased.  Further orders are expected soon."

1836, "At least we were able to save one of the transports.  We lost half the data, but the half you retrieved just might be enough.  In ordinary circumstances, we'd reprimand you pilot.  But in these circumstances we have no choice but to put you back into battle.  The final conflict looms.  All our forces are gathering for a last counterstrike."

1837, "If you are having trouble keeping both transports alive, keep this in mind:  The Leo squadron of bombers has only 4 bombers.  Destroy them as quick as possible, and you are free to worry about Omega 2.  If you can't destroy the Typhon, at least try to disable it with disruptor missiles while Omega 2 flies by."

1838, "It is impressive that you managed to destroy a primary flagship of the Hammer of Light.  Perhaps this will put an end to their resistance.  Fighting the Hammer of Light has been a great strain on the Terran-Vasudan alliance."

1855, "There will be 5 waves of Shivan enemies.  Each wave will be comprised of 3 to 6 groups of enemy ships.  After clearing the final wave, you will have run the Gauntlet.  Doing so will win you a certain level of honor and privilege within the League of Defense.  Good luck, Pilot."

1856, "While you were able to survive the first phase of Shivan enemies, you were unable to meet the challenge presented to you by the other waves.  Your performance was what we would expect from a rookie fresh from flight school.  If this is how you fight, pray you get a desk job."

1857, "You were able to survive two phases of Shivan enemies before you evacuated the Gauntlet.  This was a marginally satisfactory performance, one that we might expect from an Alliance reserve pilot.  Don't worry about your job security, though.  The Alliance is always in need of cannon fodder."

1858, "You conquered three phases of Shivan fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attmept to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

1893, "Terran Intelligence is certain that there are four small attack wings responsible for the attacks on our convoys."

1894, "You are to sweep the asteroid field and take out the four Vasudan attack wings.  Be aware that the asteroids will be causing interference with your sensors.  You won't be able to target the Vasudans until they are near, but they won't see you either."

1895, "If you encounter the Vasudan ace, you may use your discretion as to whether or not to engage him.  Keep in mind that your primary objective is to take out the four attack wings.  Check your loadouts and commit when ready."

1896, "Nicely done, pilot.  By destroying the Vasudan attack wings you have helped to ensure that our convoys will make it through this subspace node."

1898, "We are awarding you the Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment."

1900, "Don't get too far ahead of your wingmen, or they won't be able to assist you.  If you get in trouble, use the Comm menu to request cover.

Using missiles on the Vasudans early on can make it easier to take them out with guns.

If you are having trouble finding the Vasudans, try flying towards their general vicinity by following your radar.  If you wait long enough, they'll probably come to you."

1901, "We understand that you did not engage the Vasudan Ace.  It is understandable, given the skill of your opponent.  Still, it would have been a blow to the Vasudans' morale if he had been defeated."

Unfortunately, the contents of this cargo were stolen by a traitor, flying the Omega transport.  These prototypes will need to be recovered."

He has also managed to steal the plans for the Avenger prototype cannon.  These need to be recovered immediately.

The Galatea has received a full complement of the new Valkyrie Interceptor Fighters.

Some of you may remember the Angel Scout Fighter.  It has been completely modified and fitted with two additional engines, making it the fastest fighter in the fleet.  It has been re-designated the Valkyrie.  It should enable you to make short work of enemy fighters.

1983, "After the Comet and the Omega have left the area, it is your responsibility to eliminate any remaining hostiles.  Once the area is clear, you are to jump back to the Galatea."

1984, "Note that you will be required to engage Terran pilots.  These pilots are traitors to the Alliance, and no quarter should be given.  Thousands of lives are at stake.  Do not hesitate to use deadly force on the traitors.  They are your enemy."

1985, "If you encounter significant resistance or experience severe losses, $f Delta wing will be sent by Terran Command to assist.  If further assistance is needed, call in $f Epsilon wing, as well.  Good luck, pilot."

1986, "We wanted McCarthy taken alive, Pilot.  Your squad's lack of control is disturbing.  We are not pleased with this."

1987, "Make sure you use your disruptors when trying to disable McCarthy.  They do minimal damage to a ship's hull, while inflicting normal damage on its electronics and subsystems.  Once Omega is disabled, hostile ships may try to destroy him.  Make sure they do not."

The Vasudans will surely use this against us in future encounters."

1990, "Make sure you disable the Omega as soon as possible in order to recover the prototype.  Once the Omega's engines are destroyed, the GTT Comet will arrive and capture the Omega."

These ships are not detectable by our sensors.  Worse, they appear to have some type of energy-shielding system, making them nearly immune to our attacks.

But the greatest concern is their weapons.  They are more powerful than anything in the GTA or VPE arsenal.

We believe the data you gathered will prove valuable in discovering a weakness in this new adversary."

Terran Command has confirmed the existence of a new species.  Until further contact is established, Command has designated them ''Shivans''.

The Shivans have inflicted heavy casualties to both Terran and Vasudan forces in the Beta Cygni and Vega systems, and appear to be making a rapid push into other key systems along the Terran-Vasudan front.  All contact has been lost with our forces in the Ikeya and Ross 128 systems."

2067, "$b The $b Vasudans

The Vasudan government has contacted the GTA and proposed a cease fire.  Considering the reports regarding the Vasudan and Terran losses to the Shivans, this should not come as a surprise.

Terran Command has not yet responded.

Expect to hear more from Terran Command on this later today."

2068, "$b Hostile $b Contacts

All Shivan forces should be considered a serious threat.

You are authorized to engage any Shivan ship that stands in the way of your mission objectives.

Attempts to establish communication with the Shivans have failed.  Intelligence will continue its attempts to learn more about this new adversary."

2069, "$b Shivan $b Technologies

What little information has been learned about Shivan technology concerns their fighter shielding system.  This shield system makes them nearly impervious to our ML-16 Laser.

R&D is currently modifying the Avenger Prototype cannon to make it more useful against the shields.

Additionally, our fighters cannot target their ships due to our lack of data regarding the Shivan electronics systems.  Plans are currently underway to remedy this situation."

Terran Intelligence is working around the clock to give us more information.

Until then, we have been ordered to move into the Beta Cygni system and monitor any activity."

2071, "Due to increased encounters with Shivan forces, Terran Command has ordered the Galatea to the Beta Cygni system to monitor Shivan activity.  The Galatea has taken quite a beating since her last repair, and there isn't time to follow the safest route."

2072, "The Antares-Beta Cygni Jump Node lies in the center of a dense asteroid field, making it one of the least used jump nodes in the galaxy.  Standard procedure would have us circumvent this node completely, requiring two jumps.  Now we have no choice."

2074, "Alpha Wing will fly point for the $f Galatea and destroy any asteroids that cross its flight path."

2075, "Asteroids that are considered a threat to the $f Galatea will be marked by white targeting brackets.  Destroy these asteroids first."

2076, "Once the Galatea has jumped out, you are to report to the $f GTD $f Bastion, stationed in Antares.  The $f Bastion will take you to Ikeya for your next mission.  Your wing will rendezvous with the $f Galatea in Beta Cygni upon completion of that mission."

2077, "In the event of enemy attack, you are to cover the Galatea's escape from the system at any cost."

2078, "Abandoning the Galatea in an asteroid field was an inexplicable act of cowardice.  The Galatea has been destroyed and you are to blame.  You are hereby stripped of all rank and duties."

2079, "Stay in the area until the Galatea can depart.  If you are having trouble staying alive long enough, try flying slower and using thrusters to control your speed.  Asteroids are often much farther than they seem."

2080, "The destruction of the Galatea is a major loss for the Terran Alliance.

Thousands of lives were lost due to your poor execution.

Perhaps this task should have been given to a more skilled pilot.  You are hereby stripped of all rank and duties in the GTA."

2081, "If the Galatea takes too many asteroid hits, it will not survive.  Concentrate on the asteroids with the white targeting brackets.  The Galatea's turrets will also fire on the asteroids.  Don't waste time with the ones the Galatea is firing on.

Pay special attention to the area around the subspace node.  Asteroids in this area pose a greater threat to the Galatea.

If the Galatea is being destroyed by the Shivans, try shooting down their bombs after they have been launched."

2082, "The Galatea made it to Beta Cygni, but our reports show it took serious damage.  It will be in repair for at least three days.

It's a pity you couldn't better protect it, but what's done is done.  Report to briefing at 0800."

2083, "Protecting it from every asteroid may not be possible, but you should try to keep the Galatea above 70% hull.

Once the bombers come in, shooting down a few of their bombs will save the Galatea from a lot of damage."

2104, "At least five cargo depots of unknown origin have been located here in Ikeya.  These cargo formations are different than any Vasudan and Terran formation, and are believed to belong to the Shivans."

2105, "Reconnaissance indicates that the depot is protected by six sentry guns on the outer edges.  This depot provides a prime opportunity to gather more information about the Shivans.  Their offensive activity in this system is at a minimum, and we do not believe that they will make a serious attempt to defend this depot."

2106, "Long range scanners indicate that some of these cargo containers contain unusual electronics.  They appear to be similar to those used to give the Shivans their shielding technology.  A short range scan of these containers is the primary objective in this operation."

2107, "Further reconnaissance indicates another container group may contains parts for a Shivan sensor array.  A short range scan of this group should provide crucial data needed to adjust ship sensors to attain radar lock on Shivan fighters.  Scanning those containers is your secondary objective."

2108, "You will jump in approximately six kilometers from the cargo depot.  Proceed to the cargo depot quickly, and eliminate all sentry guns.  This will enable our freighters to collect the cargo after you have scanned it."

Your hearing is scheduled for 0700."

2110, "At least try to meet your objectives.  Sometimes that's all it takes."

2111, "Despite the Shivan ambush, you had a mission to accomplish.  Your orders were to remain in the area, unless ordered to leave by Terran Command.

Your defiance of these orders has wasted a prime opportunity."

2112, "Once the Shivans have sprung their trap, stealth is no longer an option.

Use your afterburners as much as possible, and attempt to scan the cargo containers.  Your wingmen will do their best to cover you."

2113, "It is fortunate that you were able to escape the Shivan trap.  Your persistence in obtaining the data we needed is commendable.

While you were unable to gather the shield data, another of our Ikeya task forces was successful in acquiring it.

The data you did gather about Shivan sensor technology will be vital in combating the Shivan forces.  Our technicians now believe they will be able to implement a targeting solution for Shivan ships.

Good work, pilot."

2114, "The Shivans protected the shield technology too well.  There was nothing you could do to acquire it."

2115, "Your success in acquiring the shield technology against such overwhelming odds has indicated to us that you are, in truth, working with the Shivans.  Your interrogation is scheduled for 0930.  You will be escorted to the brig."

The GTA has signed a cease-fire and non-aggression pact with the Vasudans.  Command has already expressed great relief, largely due to the huge drain on military and economic resources the war has caused in the past few years.

The end of a 14-year war should bring peace.  Unfortunately there is no time to breathe easy.

Unfortunately, not all Vasudan forces have agreed to the cease-fire.  Reports have been received of attacks by a rogue group of Vasudans calling themselves the ''Hammer of Light''.

Hammer of Light (HOL) appears to be willfully aiding the Shivan cause, citing some Vasudan legend about the coming of an all-powerful race.

In appreciation of your fine performance in our first operation with allied Vasudans, we are awarding you the Vasudan Alliance Medal."

2230, "The Taranis is heading for the Beta Cygni subspace node, where it will probably resupply.  This will allow for a small window of opportunity in which to conduct a strike."

2231, "The Taranis is heading for the Beta Cygni subspace node, where we expect it to mount an offensive.  This only allows a small window of opportunity in which to conduct a preemptive strike."

2232, "Your primary objective is to disable and disarm the $h Taranis in order to enable its capture.  This will be our first attempt to capture a major Shivan vessel.  Three wings will be assigned to this task."

2233, "Alpha Wing will be flying Athena bombers.  These bombers just arrived on the Galatea and are equipped with the new Stiletto bomb.  The Stiletto is capable of destroying subsystems in one hit.  Alpha's primary responsibility will be to disarm and disable the Taranis."

2234, "Beta Wing is assigned to escort Alpha and protect it from fighter attacks.  Beta will fly Apollo-class fighters."

2235, "Gamma wing will fly Valkyries and should engage any hostile fighters and bombers in the area.  If needed elsewhere, they can be assigned to any task that you see fit."

2237, "Do not allow the $h Taranis to escape or be destroyed.

Good luck."

2238, "The purpose of this mission was to capture a major Shivan vessel for analysis.  It was imperative to the war effort.  Your failure is unforgivable.

Perhaps one day you will learn that the consequences of your actions affect others.  Until that time, you are dismissed from all duties."

2239, "To disable the Taranis without destroying it, you must employ weapons that do very little hull damage.  Your best alternative would probably have been Stiletto bombs and Disruptor lasers.

If the Shivan wing Rama is destroying the cruiser, pursue and distract them.  Use your wingmen to help take them out."

2240, "The Taranis has escaped to the Beta Cygni system.

Not only has the chance to capture a Shivan cruiser been lost, but the Taranis is certain to wreak havoc in other systems.

You were ordered to disable the Taranis.  Inability to follow simple orders makes it clear that you do not belong on the Galatea.  You are hereby dismissed from all duties."

2241, "Destroying the Taranis' engine subsystem is your first, and most important task.

If the Shivan fighters are stopping you, have Beta and Gamma wing cover you while you make runs at the Taranis.

If you absolutely can't make it through, tell your wingmen to disable the Taranis.  A few well placed Stilettos should make short work of the engines."

2242, "You departed before ensuring the capture of the Taranis.  The Omega transports you left unprotected were destroyed by Shivan fighters.

Our hopes of capturing the Taranis were ruined by your carelessness.

Your career is over, Pilot."

2243, "Disarming the Taranis might seem difficult, but if you are careful about it, it shouldn't be too difficult.

Once disabled, the Taranis will be unable to move, making disarming it much easier.

Take out its Missile Launchers first, then the weapons subsystem.  This will hamper the accuracy of its remaining turrets, and give you ample time to take them out."

This may take awhile, but it is your duty to oversee the process, and to protect the ships involved.

If this gets too difficult, you may call in Delta wing to assist you."

2246, "Congratulations, Alpha 1.  You were instrumental in the first capture of a major Shivan vessel!

The Halkins is taking her to the Tombaugh station, where engineers will be able to study their technology and learn more about their methods and motives.

$b * $b Ribos $b System
$b * $b 2/11/35

$b Tombaugh $b Station $b Attack

We've just received some discouraging news from Terran Command, pilots.  At 0300 today, after the captured Taranis was towed to Tombaugh installation in the Ribos system, the Shivans staged a major ambush.  There isn't a lot of confirmation from the footage yet, but it's clear that a Shivan destroyer of massive proportions jumped in and destroyed Tombaugh station, along with all its defenses.  We have designated this new class of Destroyer ''Lucifer''.

Debris from the station is still falling from orbit on Ribos IV."

2270, "$b The $b Lucifer

Terran and Vasudan fighters and cruisers engaged the Lucifer, but were wiped out quickly.  Footage suggests that the Lucifer was using a new type of shield, impervious to any of our attacks.  Needless to say, this is grim news.  If the Shivans indeed have managed to shield a vessel of that magnitude, it's merely a matter of time before they wipe out all front-line installations and march through to our home systems."

2271, "$b Diplomacy

Since all attempts at communication with the Shivans have ended in violence, it appears unlikely that a diplomatic solution will work."

2272, "$b System $b Status

At this point, the Shivans have control of Beta Cygni, Betelgeuse, Ross 128, Ikeya, and Regulus.  Most of the Vasudan forces are gathering in Vega for a counterstrike, while we are gathering our fleet in Antares for an effort to retake Ribos and Beta Cygni.  Oddly enough, the Shivans don't seem to be interested in taking control of any planets in the systems, or gathering natural resources.  Instead they seem to be focused on controlling individual jump nodes."

2273, "$b New $b Technology: $b Flail $b Cannon

Research and Development teams at Sol have recently completed development on a few new weapons.

A group of Terran scientists has returned from a previously unexplored system known as Laramis, and bring with them a new weapon called the Flail.

The Flail is quite different from our typical energy cannons.  Please consult the weapons database in the Tech Room for more details."

2274, "$b New $b Technology: $b Interceptor $b Missile

Our communications with Vasudan technicians have yielded the Interceptor missile.  By combining the Vasudan-designed engine with a Terran warhead, we were able to produce the most powerful anti-fighter weapon yet.  It's an aspect-seeking missile, and requires a few seconds to lock onto the enemy's engine signature, but its speed and accuracy make it lethal.  Use it well."

2275, "The survivors of the Tombaugh attack must be evacuated from the Ribos system immediately.  We do not have sufficient firepower to retake Ribos at this time.  Your wing's objective is to escort the Iota transports."

2276, "Other wings will be accompanying this convoy.  Alpha wing will be in charge of this operation and will have command authority."

2277, "The convoy must reach the designated checkpoint.  Escort from this point onward will be provided by allied Vasudan forces, led by the PVD Pinnacle."

2278, "Hostile forces have been spotted all over this system, and there is a good chance that our convoy will be attacked by Shivan fighters."

2279, "All hostile forces should be eliminated."

2280, "The $f PVD $f Pinnacle will be arriving at the designated check point.  This Typhon class destroyer has one of the most skilled crews in the PVE.  It will escort the refugees for the remainder of their journey."

2281, "Help the Pinnacle until it has dismissed you, then return to base.  Many lives depend on this operation.  Good luck."

2282, "Your primary objective was to escort the transports to the rendezvous with the Pinnacle.  They were destroyed and hundreds of innocent lives were lost.  Such failure cannot be tolerated in the GTA."

2283, "Always make sure that Iota wing is protected.  Attack all ships that attack your transports, and try not to get too far behind them.  If you are still having difficulty protecting them, try equipping your ship with a Flail cannon.  If you survive long enough, the Pinnacle will arrive to assist you."

2284, "Great job, Alpha 1.  You managed to save all three of the Iota transports from the Shivan attacks.  We were told by the crew of the Pinnacle to congratulate you on a job well done.  The civilians on those transports owe you their lives as well."

2285, "You safely escorted some of the refugees in Iota and for that you are to be commended.  It is unfortunate that so many had to lose their lives.  They will be mourned."

2286, "Protecting all 3 transports is extremely difficult.  You may have to assign individual ships to protect individual transports."

2287, "Epsilon lost all of Omega wing.  The Shivan war machine is fast taking its toll on our population."

2288, "Asking for Epsilons help can have dire consequences."

2289, "Beta could not protect Sigma wing, and all of the Sigma transports were destroyed.  Admiral Halkins, a 10 year veteran of the war and a great soldier, was on Sigma.  He will be greatly missed."

2299, "Did you see what was left of Ribos?"

2313, "The crew of the GTC Ravage thanks you for saving their lives.  The Shivans will find their assault on Antares far more difficult with the Ravage on board.

For saving the crew of the GTC Ravage, we are awarding you the Medal of Conspicuous Gallantry."

2314, "The destruction of the GTSC Asimov has struck a major blow to our attempts to preserve this sector.  Due to the loss of the Asimov's data, Project Tsunami is no more.

Without it, we have no chance of destroying enough major Shivan vessels to win this war."

2315, "Protecting the Asimov requires that you do not let any of the Shivan bombers near it.  There are plenty of Shivan fighters in the area, but you must ignore them and go for the bombers first.  Target the Shaitans and destroy them as fast as possible with your Interceptors."

2450, "The Shivans are leaving their cargo behind!"

2451, "You were clearly ordered to NOT destroy the cargo!  Pilots, secure the area and jump back to base."

2452, "We've got four Shivan freighters with cargo and two transports in the area."

2453, "The Eva jumped out before we could reach it."

2454, "Alpha and Beta, try to destroy the freighters without destroying the cargo."

2455, "GTT Harmon moving in to dock with Shivan cargo."

2456, "GTT Marcos docking with Shivan cargo now."

$b * $b Deneb $b System
$b * $b 2/20/35

$b Our $b Orders

We are under general quarters because a fighter patrol detected advance ships from the Lucifer fleet approaching Vasuda Prime.

Somehow, the Shivan forces have circumvented our blockade at Antares, and now control the Deneb system.  We are en route to Deneb as we speak.  ETA is thirty-five minutes, so when you leave here, report to your wing station for immediate mission briefings.

The Lucifer itself is behind the vanguard force, so we can expect it to make an appearance at any time."

2462, "$b New $b Technology: $b Ulysses $b Advanced $b Fighter

The Vasudan-Terran Ulysses project has been completed, and the Galatea has received a complement of these fighters.  It is the most maneuverable craft ever developed by the PVN or the GTA, and it should be extremely useful in this next series of sorties.  It can also be equipped with the Prometheus cannon, the most powerful cannon weapon we've ever developed.  Use them both well."

2463, "$b Capturing $b a $b Shivan $b Fighter

Intelligence has concocted a daring plan to enable us to learn more about the Shivans.  We are going to attempt to capture a Shivan fighter.  Suit up and report to your wing stations for briefings immediately."

2464, "The Shivans have established quite a base of operations in the Deneb system.  They have multiple supply depots scattered across the system, as well as several repair centers for their damaged fighters."

2465, "Each of their repair stations consists of a Cain-class cruiser and extra supplies.  The Shakti is one such cruiser in the area."

2466, "All fighters in the area around the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets.  One of our objectives in this mission is to put this repair station out of commission.  This will greatly reduce Shivan capability in the Deneb system."

2467, "All the fighters in the area near the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets."

2468, "One of the fighters being repaired by the Shakti is a Dragon-class fighter, designated '$h Arjuna $h 1'.  The Dragon is the Shivans' most maneuverable craft, and the most dangerous."

2469, "Intelligence has requested that we capture the Dragon for research purposes.  Since the Arjuna 1 Dragon is very low on power, it is in a weakened state, and is the best candidate for this operation.  You must disable Arjuna 1 by destroying its engine subsystem."

2470, "Once Arjuna 1 has been disabled, the $f Charon will dock with it and jump back to the Galatea.  We must capture Arjuna 1.  We cannot allow it to be destroyed.  To this end, we've equipped your craft with an advanced disruptor cannon.  Use it to take out its engines."

2471, "Since this station is so poorly defended, we are sending only Alpha and Beta to attack.  Alpha will cover Beta until the Shakti has been destroyed.  Then Alpha will attempt to disable Arjuna 1."

2472, "If Alpha fails to disable Arjuna 1, Delta wing will be available.  As Delta is currently guarding the $f Bastion, we will only send them in if it is imperative.  However, we believe you can do it without their help."

2473, "Because we are custom outfitting your ship, you will not be able to customize your loadout.  You have your orders.  Dismissed."

2474, "Great work Alpha 1.  We've destroyed a Shivan repair depot, and managed to get ahold of an intact Shivan fighter.  Our technicians are currently working on reverse engineering it."

2475, "For your excellent piloting abilities, the GTA has decided to award you the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Congratulations."

2476, "Your failure to destroy the Shakti has crippled our chances of holding the Deneb sector.  Such critical failures cannot be tolerated."

2477, "Your best bet in destroying the Shakti is your Beta wing bombers.  If you can keep the fighters off their backs for long enough for them to get off their Tsunami bombs, the Shakti is doomed.  However, even if you lose the bombers, you can still destroy the Shakti yourself.  Try taking out its weapons systems first, and then its turrets.  If worse comes to worst, you can call in Delta to assist you."

2478, "Good work destroying the Shakti.  Delta wing was successful in capturing the Dragon-class fighter.  However, due to Delta's absence, the Bastion took quite a beating near Deneb III.  She survived, but is in need of repairs.  It is unfortunate that you needed their help to disable a single Shivan fighter."

2479, "Disabling a Dragon is no easy task, but you have been equipped with the proper tools to do it.  Arjuna 1's power supply is low, and it cannot regenerate its shields.  Concentrate first on eliminating its shielding, and then focus on trying to get off any hits you can with the Advanced Disruptor.  Patience is the key."

2480, "You were specifically ordered not to destroy Arjuna 1.  Yet it was destroyed.  Such insubordination cannot be tolerated.  While we regret having to do so, we are grounding you for the next three months."

2481, "Do not destroy Arjuna 1.  While using the Prometheus to weaken its shields is useful, make sure you are only using the Advanced Disruptor once the Dragon's shields are down.  Do not use your missiles on it either."

$b Our $b Orders

We have now entered the Deneb system.  After your investigation of the Lucifer at Antares, Terran Command has deduced that the Shivans will be attempting a multiple pronged attack on Vasuda Prime coming from Deneb and Antares.

The Intrepid and the Minnow will be in charge of protecting the Antares-Vasuda Prime node, while the Galatea and the Bastion will be guarding Deneb."

2504, "$b The $b Shivan $b Attack

We expect the main force of the Shivan attack will come through Antares, led by the Lucifer.  A smaller secondary force, led by the Demon-class destroyer Eva, will come through Deneb.  The Shivans already control the Vega-Deneb Jump Node, so our defense will have to be at the Deneb-Vasuda Prime Jump Node.

Finding and destroying the Eva destroyer is our top priority."

2505, "$b The $b Captured $b Shivan $b Dragon

As you know, we captured a Shivan Dragon-class fighter in Beta Aquilae.  Our technicians have retro-fitted this alien fighter with Terran instrumentation and gotten it into working condition.

However, there are a few flaws with our redesign.  We could not get the Shivan weaponry to operate, so this fighter has been equipped with Terran weaponry.  We also could not properly operate the lateral thrusters or afterburners, so the ship's maneuverability is limited.

We also have had some difficulty with the Shivan engine systems.  In test runs, the Dragon broke down for short periods of time.  We are looking into this problem as we speak.

The capture of this Shivan fighter will bring great strides in fighter technology to the Alliance."

2506, "In this mission we will be using the captured Shivan Dragon-class fighter on a scouting mission in the Deneb system."

2507, "The Shivans seem to be bringing in a large number of vessels into the Deneb system through the Vega jump node.  We believe this is in preparation for a preliminary assault on Vasuda Prime."

2508, "Because the Shivans have tight control over the Vega-Deneb jump node, we cannot send in a Terran scout.  By flying the Shivan Dragon,  we believe you will be able to slip in undetected."

2509, "There are four Shivan fighters in the area, maintaining tight patrol.  If you come into close range with these fighters, they will certainly scan your ship, detect your presence, and open fire.  Avoid contact with any of the Arjuna fighters."

2510, "Arjuna seems to be maintaining consistent patterns in their patrol."

2511, "On arrival, observe their flight pattern and plan your course to avoid contact."

2512, "In the event that you are engaged by Arjuna wing, return to the Galatea immediately."

2513, "Your primary objective is to conduct a close scan of all ships that pass through the Vega-Deneb Jump Node.  This includes warships, freighters, and transports.  Try to determine the contents of any cargo containers in the area, as well."

2514, "We have reason to believe that a Shivan Demon-class destroyer, the $h Eva, will be passing through this area.  If it does, it is imperative that you scan it.  Remember that your fighter is only partially functional, and its flight systems will behave unpredictably.  Be careful.  Command out."

2515, "You failed to scan enough ships for Intelligence to analyze the Shivan forces effectively.  With the Lucifer class destroyer in the area, we are in grave danger.  Your failure to collect the needed data will have dire consequences."

2516, "Scanning the warships means getting close enough to all the cruisers and capital ships to fully scan them.  The cruisers should be easy, you can simply wait for them to come to you while you are avoiding Arjuna.  Eva leaves pretty quick, so you have to make sure you scan it as fast as possible."

2517, "You were unable to stay in the area long enough to get a clear reading on the Shivan attack force.  This failure will cost us dearly."

2518, "Make sure you wait for orders before you return to base.  Only after Terran Command is sure that all ships are accounted for will you be ready to leave.  If you are being detected by Arjuna wing, make your best effort to avoid them.  Once the warships start coming in, make quick runs to scan them and then get back out of Arjuna's range."

2519, "Pilot, you bring us terrible news.  If both the Eva and the Lucifer are here in Deneb, it will be extremely difficult to stop the Shivan attack.  Still, you did an excellent job scanning the Shivan warships.  Well done."

2520, "It is unfortunate you were unable to get readings on the Shivan freighters and transports.  It would have been useful to know what supplies the Shivans were bringing into the area."

2521, "Inspecting the freighters and transports takes a little bit of cunning.  You have to be very careful to avoid the Arjuna ships, while you scan the ships as fast as possible.  The best chance of scanning the freighters is while they are docking.  The transports you should get behind and match speed.  And always use your hotkeys to monitor Arjuna's position."

2522, "The fact that you were also able to scan the Shivan supply ships is truly outstanding.  Your courage and piloting skills are to be commended.

However, the news is bad.  The Shivans have enough supplies in those ships to sustain a lengthy assault on Vasuda Prime.  We believe their attack force will consist of at least eight full squadrons of fighters, both Genma cruisers, the Eva, and the Lucifer.  Things do not look good."

2523, "The cargo you identified contains parts for Shivan fighters.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans will set up a base in the Deneb sector, near Vasuda Prime.  This information will be invaluable in planning our counterstrike.

For your diligence in reconnaissance missions, we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

2562, "If you were playing this through a campaign, you would never see this.  It would take you straight into the next mission."

2563, "You failed to destroy the Eva.  We cannot hope to defend this system against two Shivan capital ships.  We will now be retreating to Vasuda Prime, where we must make a stand."

2564, "First, get rid of the Dragons by ordering your wingmen.  Your first task should be taking out the weapons system on the Eva.

2578, "Good job destroying the Eva."

2579, "The Galatea has been destroyed.  Many lives, many friends are gone.  Everyone in the Terran Alliance feel this loss deeply.

Yet, greater is the tragedy of the Vasudans.  There is nothing between the Shivan fleet and Vasuda Prime.  Soon their homeworld will be gone.

Our fighters fought bravely to preserve the Galatea, but there was nothing to be done.  The Lucifer was too powerful."

2580, "The Galatea has been destroyed.  Not by the hand of a cruiser or a destroyer.  But by a bomber.  This is truly a sad day for the Alliance.  If a squadron of bombers can destroy one of our flagships, how can we defeat the Lucifer?"

2581, "Protect the Galatea from the bombers at all costs.  Attack the Nephilims before worrying about the Manticores.  Shooting down the Nephilim's bombs will preserve the Galatea even longer.  If you managed to save some Synaptic bombs from the Eva attack, use them now."

2582, "You fled the most important battle of your career.  The Galatea has been lost and the people of Vasuda Prime are doomed.

Such cowardice is unconscionable.  You are permanently grounded."

2583, "At least make an attempt to save the Galatea!"

2584, "Many lives were saved by the Hermes escape pods.  For that we are thankful.  But we mourn the loss of Admiral Wolf.  He was a great commander and he died with the ship he loved.

This is Admiral Shima.  I'll be delivering your command briefs while you're onboard the GTD Bastion.  I extend a welcome to all pilots formerly stationed on the Galatea.  I wish your reassignments could have come under better circumstances.

The loss of the Galatea is a great blow to all of us.  We've lost many friends and loved ones.  We've also lost many great pilots.  We will need to double our efforts if we plan on stopping the Shivan fleet."

This brings me to the reason for this briefing.  As some of you may have already heard, shortly after the destruction of the Galatea at nineteen-hundred last night, we received word that the Shivan Lucifer made the jump to Vasuda Prime.  The Lucifer fleet bombarded Vasuda Prime from orbit for thirteen hours straight."

2602, "$b Aftermath $b of $b Vasuda $b Attack

Most escaping transport ships were destroyed.  All major Vasudan cities were leveled, and most of the landmass was rendered uninhabitable.  All of our attacks launched from the nearby installations were defeated.

We have lost contact with all Terran ships in the area, but it appears that the Shivan fleet has now moved on.  It's estimated that four billion innocent Vasudans lost their lives in the attack.

Terran Command is preparing to help evacuate all survivors to other habitable worlds in the area."

2603, "$b Our $b Orders

What we need to concentrate on now is keeping the Lucifer fleet from making further moves towards Earth.  We've been put on standby status and ordered to assist in all evacuation operations in Vasuda Prime and the surrounding systems.

2650, "After you have completed these tasks, stand by for further orders.  Good luck, Alpha 1."

2651, "You were ordered to stay in the area until you received further orders.  Yet you jumped out and the mission is a failure.  You are hereby grounded.  Dismissed."

2652, "Stay in the area and await further orders.  If you can't beat the Zenith, try to first eliminate all Dragons in the area, then go straight for the Zenith's comms.  Once the comms are out, target the weapons system and then allow your bombers to finish him off."

2659, "In a last ditch effort to stave off the Shivan attack, Terran Command pursues all the leads that it has.  One such lead takes the player and his squadron deep into conquered Vasudan territory in order to recover an ancient artifact.  And while the preliminaries are complete, the chances of this operation going off without a hitch are all but... nil."

2660, "As you already know, we are sending scientists to the Altair system to investigate records found on Altair IV.  Command hopes they will aid us in our war with the Shivans.

The Rosetta is currently carrying the scientists.  It will rendezvous with two transports, Omega 1 and Omega 2.  All three ships should be arriving within a few minutes.

Omega wing will dock with the Rosetta as soon as they arrive.  Oversee this personnel transfer, then escort Omega 1 and Omega 2 to the jump node."

2661, "Forget Rosetta.  Getting those two transports out alive is far more important.  You have to take out those heavy attack Basilisks as fast as possible, before they launch their streams of swarm missiles."

2667, "We have successfully extracted the records from Altair IV.  They have been partially deciphered and are being moved back to Terran Space.  Omega transports will once again be handling the movement of the scientists and the records."

2668, "We have successfully extracted the records from Altair IV.  They have been partially deciphered and are being moved back to Terran Space.  Omega will once again be handling the movement of the scientists and the records."

2669, "If worse comes to worst, let Omega 2 die, and go straight for the Leo bombers.  Once you've destroyed the first wave of Leos, you can simply order everyone to engage fighters, and you should have little trouble escorting Omega 1 to the jump node."

2670, "If you are having trouble keeping both transports alive, keep this in mind:  The Leo squadron of bombers has only 4 bombers, and no reinforcements.  Destroy them as quickly as possible, and you are free to worry about Omega 2.  If you can't destroy the Typhon, at least try to disable it with disruptor missiles while Omega 2 flies by."

$b The $b Lucifer

The Shivans have finally determined the location of the Sol system.  The Lucifer has moved into position here in Sirius for the subspace jump to Delta Serpentis.

From Delta Serpentis, she will certainly  make the jump to Sol to destroy our homeworld."

2674, "$b New $b Information

From the records you retrieved in Altair, we have discovered the means to destroy the Lucifer.  As you know, our shield systems do not work in subspace.  The same holds true for the Lucifer.  More importantly, the records contain the information to enable us to track a capital ship into and inside subspace.

If we can track the Lucifer into subspace, we believe a small strike force may be sufficient to destroy it."

2675, "$b Our $b Orders

We have been assigned the task of destroying the Lucifer before she reaches Sol.  The Bastion is currently en route to intercept the Lucifer at the Sirius-Delta Serpentis subspace node.

The Bastion will attempt to provide close cover, while Ursa bombers deliver a payload of Harbingers.  We believe that without the shielding system it's relied on so heavily, the Lucifer will be vulnerable.

Keep in mind that this is a time critical operation.  If we do not enter subspace soon after the Lucifer, we cannot launch our attack."

2676, "$b Destroying $b the $b Lucifer

From your earlier scans of the Lucifer in the Deneb system, we have determined that it is powered by five primary reactors.  These reactors are spread out across the Lucifer.

If all five reactors are destroyed in a short period of time, the Lucifer won't have a chance of surviving."

2677, "We don't have much time.  Report for mission briefings immediately."

2678, "We have few chances to stop the $h Lucifer.  It is heading to the Sol system but we have an opportunity to head them off at Sirius."

2679, "If you encounter the Lucifer in Sirius, hold it off until the rest of the fleet can catch up with you."

2680, "The Bastion was severely damaged in this battle.  More of the burden of destroying the Lucifer will shift to the bombers.  The Bastion will be of limited assistance.

We are now proceeding to the Delta Serpentis system."

2681, "Try to destroy all bombers before they reach the Bastion."

2682, "The GTD Bastion is in prime condition to assault the Lucifer.  We are proceeding to Delta Serpentis now."

2683, "For your outstanding defense of the GTD Bastion, you are awarded the Military Defense Medal."

2684, "The Bastion has been destroyed.  There is little hope of stopping the Lucifer at this point.  This is the saddest of days for the Alliance.  The Lucifer is expected to reach Earth in 40 hours."

2685, "Always kill the bombers first.  Try shooting down their bombs.  You cannot let the Bastion die at this stage of the war."

2686, "The Bastion made the jump to Delta Serpentis and you didn't you follow her?  She was destroyed shortly after her arrival.  We have no way of stopping the Lucifer.  This is certainly the end of the Alliance.  The Lucifer is expected to reach Earth in 40 hours."

2703, "Your task will be to provide cover for the Bastion so that it can quickly converge on the Lucifer.

That destroyer must be stopped at all costs.  Failure is absolutely not an option here, pilots.  Good luck."

2704, "Why you chose to leave the battle area is a complete mystery.  If any historians survive the destruction of Earth, they will surely wonder what went through your mind.

2786, "* GTD Krios
* Vega System
* 4/15/35

Welcome to the GTI

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.

You will lead Alpha wing of the 91st Phantoms.  As a pilot for the GTI, your missions will involve highly sensitive combat and containment operations.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

2787, "GTI Command Structure

The primary objective of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTA.  GTI is divided into three branches, each with its own fleet and each focusing on specific areas of intelligence.

Special Operations, headed by the GTD Krios, specializes in strategic assault and containment.  Our missions involve high-priority objectives in situations too sensitive, dangerous, or volatile for standard GTA forces.

Intelligence, led by the GTD Soyakaze, specializes in infiltration and espionage.  Intel primarily conducts reconnaissance and surgical strikes, and its missions are planned to provide minimal combat exposure."

2788, "GTI Command Structure (continued)

Research and Development, commanded by the GTD Repulse, specializes in the development of cutting-edge technologies.  R&D's missions involve the deployment and field-testing of advanced weapons and warship prototypes.  As an officer of the GTI, you will have access to these technologies before they become available to GTA pilots.

Normally, the three branches conduct joint operations in concert with one another, directed by a single command fleet.  Unfortunately, the loss of the GTD Legion in the Battle of Deneb earlier this year has forced us to decentralize our operations somewhat.  We will be taking our orders directly from GTA High Command."

2789, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.  The cataclysm seems to have also closed the phasing nodes to Deneb and Beta Aquilae via some sort of chain reaction.  We currently have no way to access the Sol system via subspace.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth, an interim GTA command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

2790, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVE has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.

Preserving the fragile peace treaty is of the utmost importance.  Both the Terran-Vasudan war and the Shivan war have taken a heavy toll on our fleets, so our species must work together if we are to have any hope of defeating the Shivan threat.  As an officer of the GTI, it is your responsibility to conduct yourself in a manner worthy of your station, both in battle and in your personal interaction with Vasudan colleagues.  Should tensions escalate out of control, Special Operations will brief you on the appropriate method for containing the situation."

2791, "New Technology: Leech Cannon

You are being issued the new Leech Cannon prototype.  The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the gun to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required: just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

2792, "At approximately 1530 hours, $f Terran and $f Vasudan fighters repelled a Shivan attack against $f Outpost $f Fermi, one of our primary communication terminals in $b Vega.  During the skirmish, Terran pilots fired on our Vasudan allies with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the $f PVE learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the $h Shivans will soon collapse."

2793, "Your objective will be to sanitize the area to prevent news of this incident from spreading beyond our secure zone.  Destroy everything but the $f GTI communications terminal.  The loss of innocent lives is regrettable but necessary to preserve the $f Terran-Vasudan $f alliance and defeat the $h Shivans.  You must not fail."

2794, "We have a window of five minutes during which we must complete this operation.  Staying any longer risks detection by $f GTA or $f PVE forces.  Get in, do your job, and get out.  Good luck."

2795, "Well done, pilot.  You executed a clean sweep of the area and contained a volatile incident.  Vasudan Command remains unaware of these events and the peace treaty remains intact."

2796, "For demonstrating a strong sense of duty and a commitment to preserving the Terran-Vasudan alliance at any cost, you are awarded the Commendation Medal."

2797, "Unfortunately, your squadron destroyed the GTI communications terminal in your haste to prevent the PVT Aries from using it.  While the terminal was not as important as the success of today's mission, it still represents a significant GTI asset that must now be replaced.

This incident will be noted in your record.  I suggest you avoid such losses in the future."

2798, "Don't destroy the terminal."

2799, "You failed to eliminate the PVT Aries before it communicated our objectives to Vasudan forces.  The Vasudans view this incident as an outright betrayal of the Terran-Vasudan alliance and have threatened to withdraw from the peace treaty.  Terran Command has disavowed the entire Special Operations branch of GTI and is struggling to avoid outright war.  You and your squadron will pay for your incompetence."

2800, "Destroy the transport Aries before it can use the communications terminal to send a message, preferably before it docks with the terminal in the first place.  Don't forget to use your wingmen."

2801, "You allowed the PVT Pisces to escape and notify Vasudan forces of today's events.  This incident has jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans and threatens to plunge the alliance into outright war.  Terran Command has disavowed all support of our operations.  You and your squadron will pay for your incompetence."

2802, "Be aware of the positions of all ships in the area.  You cannot afford to let any escape.  Don't forget to use your wingmen."

2803, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  Although you completed your objectives within your five-minute window, you failed to depart the engagement zone before being detected.  You have compromised our secrecy, and the GTA may now have sufficient evidence to reconstruct the original incident.  You are grounded permanently."

2804, "Return to base within your five-minute window."

2805, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  By exposing this mission you have jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans and caused the GTA to disavow support of our operations.  You are grounded permanently."

2806, "Complete your mission within your five-minute window."

2807, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot.  Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the GTA's objectives in this theatre.  Desertion is grounds for a court martial, and you are confined to quarters pending your preliminary hearing.  Until a military court decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran Alliance."

2856, "Good work, pilots.  Keep an eye out for enemy ships.  The Pinnacle's fighters will arrive in a few minutes."

2857, "So, what kind of research are you doing here, Chensit?"

2858, "That is classified information, Beta 3."

2859, "Oh, come on.  Just a little hint.  What's in those cargo containers?  Weapons?  New subspace drives?  Shivan technology?"

2860, "Give it a rest, Beta.  You know the spooks never tell anyone anything."

2861, "All will be revealed in due time, pilot.  This area of space should prove most fruitful to our scientific endeavors.  We look forward to sharing our findings with you when our scientists on the Pinnacle complete their research."

2867, "They haven't been the same since we took out the Lucifer.  Like they've lost the will to fight, or something.  Not that I'm complaining, of course."

2868, "We're getting hammered here!  Launching escape pods!  Pilots, protect them!"

2869, "The Shivans are swarming us!  We're launching the escape pods.  Pilots, protect them!"

2870, "We've lost the Einstein!"

2871, "Now tracking the Einstein's escape pods.  Alpha and Beta, stand by for further orders."

2872, "Pilots, your new objective is to recover the escape pods.  We will deploy reinforcements to protect the Vasudan convoy.  Transmitting jump coordinates now."

2873, "Protect the Einstein's escape pods until they can be recovered."

2874, "We have tracked the Einstein's escape pods to a remote location within the Deneb system.  As you know, Hermes-class escape pods are equipped with stripped-down subspace drives that can only be used once, after which they must be replaced.  This necessitates the deployment of a retrieval ship that can accommodate the pods in its hangar bay.

The ferocity of the Shivan attack left the escape pods with little time to properly calculate jump coordinates, forcing them to jump to the first available destination.  Although they are in no immediate danger, it will be some time before allied forces can be deployed to assist.  Your wings have been assigned to safeguard the pods until they can be retrieved.

The strength of Shivan forces in this sector is unknown.  We do not believe they will concern themselves with the escape pods, but the arrival of two fighter wings will probably draw their attention.  Destroy any Shivan vessel that interferes with your mission objectives."

2875, "Good work, pilots.  You successfully ensured the recovery of both escape pods, despite the confusion and unexpected outcome.  The personnel on board the pod we retrieved are currently being debriefed and treated for the injuries they sustained during the battle.

Command has yet to respond to our inquiries regarding the Repulse's presence in the Krios's theater of operations, so for the time being Admiral Scott is treating this incident as a security breach.  You will be updated as we receive further information.

Unfortunately, this is not the only blemish on the GTI's record today.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2876, "It seems that the Shivan presence in this system is greater than we had initially assumed.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2877, "Be glad that you were not there, pilots.  The Shivans launched a savage attack that wiped out not only your reinforcements but the entire Vasudan convoy as well.  When the Pinnacle's fighters arrived, they found only a few damaged cargo containers among the debris.  These containers were recovered intact, but irreplaceable materials and research were lost aboard the ships and cargo that were destroyed.

Admiral Scott has issued a formal apology to Vasudan Intelligence for our failure to protect the convoy.  Although the Vasudans are justifiably upset over this incident, they have fortunately chosen not to hold it against us.  They have responded that the Shivan threat is too great to risk jeopardizing the alliance over such matters.  Once the Shivans have been neutralized, our species will be able to more effectively focus our attentions on research and recovery."

2878, "Follow your orders, but stay alert.  Things may not be as they seem."

2879, "Unfortunately, Command does not share the Vasudans' optimism on the outcome of today's events.  GTI has launched a formal inquiry into this incident, and you have been grounded for the duration of the investigation."

2880, "Keep an eye on your radar display so that you can break off and engage the Shivans as soon as they arrive.  Brahma wing poses the greatest threat to the survival of the escape pods."

2881, "Destroy Kali"

2882, "Defend the escape pods until they can be retrieved"

2883, "Defend the Repulse and the Krios"

2884, "Okay, I'm reading the escape pods at 2500 meters.  Moving to escort formation."

2885, "Looks like the Shivans didn't follow them here.  That's a good sign."

2886, "Einstein escape pods, this is Beta 1 of the 91st Phantoms, GTD Krios.  We have orders to protect your craft.  Please acknowledge."

2887, "Acknowledged, Beta, and standing by.  We appreciate your help."

2888, "I've transmitted our coordinates to the Krios.  It'll be awhile before they get here, so we'll have to sit tight for a bit."

2889, "Great.  I just hope that convoy will be all right while we're away.  Forty crew for a dozen freighters with cargo is not my idea of a fair trade."

2890, "I wouldn't worry.  That convoy seemed pretty well protected -- it'd take a really large or a really coordinated attack to punch through that turret screen.  Besides, Command said reinforcements were on their way."

2891, "Looks like the Shivans found us.  Break and attack!"

2892, "We've lost the escape pods!"

2893, "Return to base, everybody.  There's nothing else we can do here."

2894, "This is the GTD Repulse.  We have orders to recover the escape pods."

2895, "Looks like the Repulse got the Shivans' attention.  They're no longer targeting the pods."

2896, "Shivan bombers inbound!  Don't let them get near the Repulse!"

2897, "More bombers arriving!  They're targeting the Krios!"

2898, "Iota and Kappa wings returning to base.  The operation was a complete success."

2899, "Acknowledged, pilot.  Assist Alpha and Beta for now.  Once the Einstein's survivors are on board, secure the area."

2900, "Understood, sir."

2901, "What's with those new fighters?  I can't target any of them."

2902, "Must be some new R&D prototype.  I didn't know they had stealth technology.  They always get first shot on all the cool stuff."

2903, "Whoops -- I can target Iota and Kappa now.  Those stealth fighters must still have a few bugs left in them."

2904, "GTD Krios now on station.  Commencing pod retrieval."

2905, "Wait a minute, who's supposed to be picking us up?"

2906, "Stand by -- we've got a bit of a situation here.  Pilots, we're launching additional fighters to assist you.  Keep the Shivans away from the pods."

2907, "All hostiles have been neutralized.  Excellent work, pilots."

2908, "Now to the matter at hand.  Admiral Glaive, what are you doing in this sector?  Isn't the Repulse currently assigned to Antares?"

2909, "I might ask you the same question, Admiral Scott.  We were ordered to proceed directly to these coordinates to retrieve a set of escape pods."

2910, "While your assistance is appreciated, sir, that does not give you the right to interfere with our mission.  Both of the escape--"

2911, "We are not here to provide assistance, Admiral, nor are we interfering.  We are here to retrieve the pods.  Command has ordered us to ensure their safe and immediate transportation to Beta Aquilae.  Your involvement is no longer required."

2912, "We've received no notification of these orders."

2913, "Nevertheless, the orders stand.  You will transfer the second escape pod from your hangar bay to ours immediately."

2914, "With all due respect, Admiral Glaive, I take orders from GTA High Command only.  I will not transfer this pod to the Repulse or anywhere else without their express authorization."

2915, "Very well.  See that you contact them immediately to resolve this matter.  In the meantime, we have business elsewhere.  GTD Repulse out."

2916, "Escort Iota through an asteroid field to a secret GTI rendezvous."

2917, "$f Intelligence has requested the help of our squadron to escort a convoy to a secret cargo transfer.  The convoy consists of three ships: the $f GTC $f Adamant and two freighters with cargo.  All three carry important supplies and research.  To avoid detection, the rendezvous point is located within a dense asteroid field."

2918, "Sentry guns have been placed at the destination, but the convoy will still require protection until it reaches the safe zone.  $f Alpha and $f Beta wings will destroy any asteroids in its path.  When the convoy has reached the safe zone, return to base."

2919, "Intelligence suspects that Shivan remnants may be using the asteroid field as a staging area.  If any $h Shivans threaten the convoy, destroy them immediately."

2920, "Good work, pilots.  The entire convoy made it to the safe zone.  The research on board those ships will greatly help us in our fight against the Shivans.  You are to be commended for your diligence in achieving your objectives despite the hazardous environment."

2921, "The Adamant and one of the freighters made it to the safe zone.  Unfortunately, the other freighter was destroyed.  This ship carried important supplies and research, and now we'll just have to make do with what we've got.

Considering the hazards of the location, your performance was adequate.  However, I remind you that officers of the GTI are held to a higher standard than those of the GTA.  We expect better performance in the future."

2922, "Don't get distracted by the Shivans.  Your first priority is to protect the convoy against the asteroids, so stick close to them."

2923, "The Shivan bomber class you encountered has been designated Seraphim.  Your scans will be helpful in determining its capabilities.  Our scientists will present the results of the data analysis shortly."

2924, "This mission was a failure.  Because of damage from asteroids and Shivan attacks, both freighters were destroyed.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future.

Intelligence is very displeased, pilots.  Admiral Tess has asked that you be transferred back to the GTD Intrepid, and I have no choice but to comply.  Your transport ships out at 1330 hours tomorrow."

2925, "It can be hard to keep up with all the fighters, bombers, and other hazards in the area, but try to first take out the asteroids.  These cause the most damage to the convoy and are your first priority."

2926, "The GTC Adamant was destroyed before it could make it to the safe zone.  Thousands of lives were lost due to your poor performance."

2927, "The GTC Adamant and one of the freighters were destroyed before they could make it to the safe zone.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future."

2928, "The entire convoy was destroyed before it could make it to the safe zone.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future."

2929, "Without the materials and personnel aboard the Adamant, GTI will be forced to postpone several key projects.  Admiral Tess has demanded a formal inquiry.

News From the Front

GTA High Command is pleased to report a major victory in our war against the Shivans.  A combined Terran-Vasudan task force crushed a massive buildup of Shivan forces in Antares, destroying the SD Demiurge and a large number of supporting cruisers and cargo depots.  With the removal of this nexus of activity, the Shivan armada has been fragmented into numerous smaller secondary fleets scattered throughout known space.  Victory over the Shivans, though far from imminent, appears to be in sight.

Both the GTA and the PVE are moving quickly to secure their positions and press the advantage.  The GTD Minnow has been deployed to Beta Cygni and Betelgeuse, while the PVD Hope is en route to Vasuda and Alpha Centauri.  The Krios, however, is returning to Antares to monitor Shivan behavior and investigate several pirate factions that have cropped up in the aftermath of the Shivan defeat."

2951, "The Deneb Incident

Terran Command has informed us that the escape pod recovery mix-up in Deneb was due to a breakdown in communications.  Misunderstandings and bureaucratic errors such as these have unfortunately plagued the GTI command structure ever since the loss of the GTD Legion several months ago.  Both the Repulse and the Krios were accidentally assigned to the same operation, and the Repulse arrived first.  The first escape pod landed in the Repulse's hangar bay, while the confused personnel on the second pod landed in the Krios.

After the Krios received confirmation of the Repulse's orders, the escape pod and its occupants were transferred to Beta Aquilae.  Terran Command has classified all official records pertaining to their proceedings on this subject."

2952, "The Einstein

In the absence of further information, the Krios is continuing to investigate the Einstein's appearance in the Deneb system.  According to service logs, the Einstein was reported destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128.  The Einstein had entered the system on a routine geological survey mission three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Deneb during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

2953, "The Einstein (continued)

Before its alleged destruction at Ross 128, the Einstein was under the command of Captain Ezra Tycho, a high-ranking GTI officer.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.

The appearance of the Einstein in such a highly secure region of space is troubling.  Analysis of the ship's flight pattern indicates that it was performing a high-level scan of the area in and around the Deneb asteroid belt.  The Einstein would be in an ideal position to observe and record the activities of all Vasudan research convoys in the area.

The purpose behind these scans, as well as any data the Einstein gathered, remain unknown.  Our brief interrogations of the Einstein's survivors yielded little useful information on this subject, as most of the command crew were aboard the escape pod retrieved by the Repulse."

2954, "New Shivan Technology: SB Seraphim

Recent engagements with Shivan forces have revealed the existence of a new class of bomber, which we have designated Seraphim.  The Seraphim appears to be similar to the Nephilim in most respects, except that it boasts an additional four primary hardpoints and its armament capacity is approximately 50% greater.  Like the Nephilim, the Seraphim is a formidable foe.  Pilots are advised to carry a heavy shield-damaging weapon, such as the Banshee, in theaters where these bombers are expected.

We are unsure as to why the Shivans waited until now to introduce the Seraphim.  Its deployment could have shifted the balance in a number of close engagements during the height of the Great War.  Now, however, the Shivans appear to lack the initiative to use it effectively."

2955, "New Technology: GTF Loki

Research and Development has completed field testing of its latest stealth fighter prototype, the GTF Loki.  Featuring high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability, the Loki is designed primarily as a reconnaissance fighter.  Its shielded reactor chamber and compact hull give it a low sensor profile, enabling it to elude detection by enemy forces.  Pursuant to regulations, the Loki's on-board IFF transponder will emit an encrypted signal to allow targeting by designated friendly units.

At this time, the Loki is restricted to GTI pilots only.  No pilot in the standard GTA fighter corps is to be authorized to fly the Loki until further notice."

2956, "Approximately one hour ago, pirate raiders launched an attack on the $f Talus $f Particle $f Accelerator complex in Antares.  This facility houses top secret GTI weapons research laboratories and is of the utmost strategic importance to the war effort."

2957, "Some of the station's research modules, already weakened by previous Shivan attacks, breached containment during the engagement, causing a massive explosion that crippled the station and destroyed virtually every ship in the immediate area, including the pirate attack force and the facility's defensive perimeter."

2958, "The only craft that remain are a crippled Leviathan-class cruiser, the $f GTC $f Leto, and eight cargo containers containing critical weapons research.  This information is extremely sensitive and must be recovered immediately."

2959, "Since the security of this sector has been severely compromised, GTI forces will recover the materials to a safe location.  The station will evacuate all personnel until repairs can be completed at a later date.  Your assignment is to ensure that this operation proceeds smoothly."

2960, "Due to the loss of the station's defenses, control of this area is extremely tenuous.  We expect the pirates to return and possibly attempt to seize the weapon prototypes during their removal.  You must prevent this at all costs."

2961, "Keep the area secure until reinforcements arrive.  A repair transport will attempt to bring the Leto's systems online to help with your defense, but it may be some time before this can be accomplished.  Command will deploy additional fighters as the need arises."

2962, "Excellent work, pilots.  The weapon prototypes were successfully recovered with all records intact.  This achievement will prove invaluable to the war effort."

2963, "Good work, pilots.  Enough warhead material was recovered to allow us to reconstruct our previous research.  The GTI should be able to make up the lost ground in a matter of weeks."

2964, "You failed to ensure the recovery of sufficient research for us to reconstruct our weapons program.  Without those materials and prototypes, our capacity to wage war against the Shivans has been compromised."

2965, "Forget everything but the freighters and cargo.  Protect them at all costs."

2966, "This mission was a disaster.  Because of your carelessness, the GTI's most sensitive weapons research is now in the hands of pirates.  This failure will cost us dearly.  You are relieved until further notice."

2967, "Scan the Kappas as soon as possible.  Your wingmen will help you out when they know who to shoot."

2968, "You also helped to rescue the facility's complement of scientists.  Every life saved is critical to the war effort.  You are to be commended for your skill in completing your objectives."

2969, "We are pleased that the GTC Leto survived this engagement.  With a few days' repair in drydock and a new crew, she'll soon be able to return to active duty.  Great work protecting a valuable fleet asset."

3008, "A routine escort mission turns deadly when the GTI loses control of its volatile cargo."

3009, "Following the recovery of the Talus Particle Accelerator, the $b Antares system is nearly secure.  Residual pirate activity is almost nonexistent, and the Shivan presence in this system is too scattered and disorganized to present a credible threat."

3010, "With the pressure on our core systems relieved, GTI is stepping up research and development of new technologies.  Several important projects are nearing completion, and GTI has decided to move them to $b Beta $b Aquilae where their results can be more closely monitored."

3011, "In this mission, you will be tasked with guarding a GTI science convoy as it transfers its cargo to Beta Aquilae.  The convoy consists of three Faustus-class cruisers: the $f GTSC $f Moreau, the $f GTSC $f Idun, and the $f GTSC $f Ratna.  The cruisers are carrying research and prototypes for $b Project $b Eumenides, the GTI's most highly classified weapons program."

3012, "You will escort the cruisers as far as the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Upon reaching Beta Aquilae, the cruisers will be joined by a second escort and taken to a secret location."

3013, "Because of the extremely sensitive nature of this convoy, we are assigning three wings to protect it.  However, we do not believe you will encounter significant resistance.  Because of the scarcity of Shivans in this system, the remaining ships seem to be unable to coordinate their attacks effectively."

3014, "As always, GTI will be on hand to monitor your progress.  Good luck."

3015, "You were clearly ordered to maintain your escort of the Ratna, pilot.  Your dereliction of duty has cost the GTI many months of research and the invaluable technology aboard that vessel.

In the GTA, desertion is grounds for court-martial.  But officers of Galactic Terran Intelligence are held to a much higher standard, and your cowardice is inexcusable on such an important mission.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  Your superiors on the Krios will be informed that you were killed in action."

3016, "If you're in a tight spot, ask your wingmen to help you out.  Reinforcements will arrive shortly after the Abaddon jumps in."

3017, "Pilot, this failure is inexcusable!  The entire convoy was lost, and now the Shivans possess our most sensitive new technology!  You have single-handedly cost us months of research and signed our entire strategic initiative over to the Shivans.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  I assure you, it will not be pretty."

3018, "Move quickly to destroy the Shivan transports before they can dock with the Ratna.  Stay close to the Abaddon's belly, because it's only a short hop from the hangar to the cruiser."

3019, "Pilot, this failure is inexcusable!  Your incompetence has cost us months of research and set us back years in our efforts to understand the Shivans.  The GTI expects top-notch performance from its pilots, and your egregious failure on such an important mission has permanently ended your career.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  Your superiors on the Krios will be informed that you were killed in action."

3020, "Watch the Ratna's hull integrity.  Also keep an eye on the ships attacking the freighters, since any stray shots may hit the Ratna."

3021, "Well done, pilots.  Despite fierce resistance, the GTI was able to recover the Ratna and its cargo.  Shivan strategies are difficult to predict, and we did not anticipate them sending a destroyer to capture a mere science cruiser."

3022, "The destruction of the SD Abaddon is a major blow for the Shivans.  Your performance in this operation was most impressive."

3023, "According to reports from Beta Aquilae, the GTI received sufficient research to continue Project Eumenides as originally planned.  This technology will benefit the GTA immensely in our fight against the Shivans.  Research and Development estimates that the first of these next-generation weapons, the EMP Missile, will be available for field testing within the month.

I have been informed by Command that the flight records for this mission have been classified Level Omega.  As such, I am required to notify you that divulging any information about this mission, directly or indirectly, to any persons other than those specifically authorized by Galactic Terran Intelligence, is a treasonous offense, punishable by death.

3084, "Pilots, we are launching Kappa wing to destroy the Abaddon.  Provide cover."

3085, "Kappa wing has been destroyed.  Return to base, pilots -- there's nothing more we can do here."

3086, "Command, what is a DEMON CLASS DESTROYER doing in Antares?!?"

3087, "Pilots, do NOT engage the Abaddon.  Maintain full escort of the Ratna!"

3088, "Look at that thing!  It's cradling the Ratna like a baby!"

3089, "The Ratna is out of range of the Abaddon!  Pilots, keep close to the freighter and ensure that it jumps out safely.  We'll distract the Abaddon for you."

3090, "Transmitting jump coordinates now.  All ships, return to base."

3091, "The GTI begins their offensive against the Shivans.  The first step is to attack a series of cargo convoys."

The Shivans

Vasudan forces have secured Vasuda, Deneb, and Sirius, while Terran forces are making rapid progress on the Vega and Betelgeuse fronts.  Isolated cells of activity are being crushed in Alpha Centauri, Aldebaran, and Regulus.  Inexplicably, all Shivan activity in the Capella colonies has vanished.

The bulk of the Shivan armada appears to be retreating to Ikeya and Ross 128, where they will likely make their stand and possibly attempt a counterattack.  However, GTA tacticians doubt their chances of success.  Experts have observed that the Shivans appear to be lacking ordered leadership and coordination."

3093, "Our Mission

While the remainder of the fleet is hunting down the Shivans in Terran and Vasudan space, Special Ops has been charged with softening up the fleeing armada as they attempt to regroup.  Your next series of missions will involve surgical strikes against overwhelming odds deep in Shivan territory.  Fortunately, we have some new tools to assist us."

3094, "New Technology: Shield Breaker

The new Shield Breaker is a special-issue weapon developed specifically for this campaign.  Designed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker is an electromagnetic energy disruptor, inflicting massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon such as the Prometheus will be effective against heavily shielded fighters and bombers.  The Shield Breaker has greater weapons compatibility and energy efficiency than the Banshee."

3095, "New Technology: GTB Zeus

Research and Development has completed field testing of the Zeus strike bomber.  Like the Athena, its predecessor, the Zeus offers excellent speed and maneuverability.  Additionally, more efficient design enables the Zeus to carry Tsunami space bombs in its arsenal.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against medium-sized targets."

3096, "Recent victories have forced the majority of the $h Shivan fleet to fall back to the initial systems in which they appeared, $h Ikeya and $h Ross $h 128.  Recon has located waves of heavily escorted Shivan convoys heading to Ikeya from Ribos.

Our mission here is twofold.  First, we will shut down the Shivan convoys and sever their supply lines.  Second, we will capture the cargo and analyze its contents."

3097, "Your squadron will enter the system between convoys.  You must quickly eliminate any Shivan fighters guarding the node.  Once the area is secured, our forces will set up an ambush."

3098, "Sentry guns will be dropped near the Ikeya jump node to intercept any escaping ships.  Alpha and Beta wings will destroy all Shivan freighters and transports, leaving the cargo intact.  Our own freighters will then pick up the cargo and depart."

3099, "We estimate we will be able to intercept at least three waves of transports before the Shivans are alerted to our plan.  In case of any unforeseen developments, await orders from Command.

Report to the flight deck immediately."

3100, "You allowed a significant part of the Shivan force to escape.  Although we were successful in neutralizing most of the Shivan supply line, the surviving ships will undoubtedly cause trouble for our forces later on.  Your failure will cost us lives and ships we should not have to lose."

3101, "Disabling the freighters will prevent them from escaping.  Alternatively, use Disruptor Missiles to temporarily knock out their systems."

3102, "Excellent work, pilot.  Your performance in this mission was outstanding.  Shivan supply lines to Ikeya have been cut off and we now have full control over this subspace node."

3103, "Good work, pilot.  Our containment operation was effective in neutralizing most of the Shivan supply line.  The few surviving ships are unlikely to provide significant reinforcement to the Shivan position in Ikeya.  Still, GTI prides itself on going above and beyond the call of duty, and our failure to destroy every ship mars our record somewhat."

3104, "You also destroyed all hostile targets, including several fighter wings and the Cain cruiser Maus.  You and your wingmen are to be commended for this accomplishment."

3105, "Unfortunately, not all the cargo was recovered.  Some of our recovery craft were destroyed by the Shivan cruisers.  With the Shivans being destroyed or disappearing all over Terran-Vasudan space, we must gather all the data about them we can while we still have the opportunity."

3106, "If you can take out some of the cruisers' turrets with Phoenix or Stiletto missiles, the transports should be able to jump out safely."

3107, "Unfortunately, not all the cargo was recovered.  Theta wing never arrived at the designated GTI rendezvous.  Command is officially listing them as MIA until evidence can be found to the contrary, but it is unlikely that they could have been intercepted by the Shivans.  Keep your eyes open for any unusual activity in the future."

3108, "Despite the odds, you stood and faced the Genma cruisers and assisted the Monitor and Leto in their defense of the node.  Your actions have saved many lives.  For going above and beyond the call of duty, you are awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Well done."

3109, "Despite the odds, you stood and faced the Genma cruisers and assisted the Monitor in its defense of the node.  Your actions have saved many lives.  For going above and beyond the call of duty, you are awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Well done."

3152, "Roger that, Command.  All right, Beta, keep those fighters off us."

3153, "Affirmative.  Watch out for the crossfire!"

3154, "Convoy one is down, Command.  All cargo is intact."

3166, "Shivans are attacking our recovery craft.  Protect them, pilots!"

3167, "Command, I'm reading two Lilith cruisers!  Request status update!"

3173, "The Shivan cruiser group Hellfire is on its way to reinforce the main Shivan battlegroup.  Your squadron's task: interception."

3174, "Reconnaissance has observed a Shivan cruiser group, designated $h Hellfire, en route to the $b Ikeya jump node.  If $h Hellfire reaches its destination, it will be reunited with the main Shivan fleet."

3175, "$h Hellfire consists of four cruisers, both Cain and Lilith class, with a fighter escort of ten to fifteen ships.  Normally we would send the $f Krios to reinforce the node blockade, but this information was acquired at the last minute and we don't have time for a full deployment."

3176, "Instead, your squad will intercept and destroy as much of the Shivan force as possible.  Beta and Delta will engage the cruisers.  Alpha and Gamma will defend the bomber wings and neutralize the fighter threat."

3177, "If $h Hellfire is stopped, we can expect a decisive victory in $b Ikeya.  If $h Hellfire gets through, the Shivans may be able to hold out long enough to mount an offensive.

Our forces are counting on you, pilots.  Report to the flight deck immediately."

3178, "Excellent job, pilots!  The entire Shivan battlegroup was destroyed, thanks to your squadron.  You have proven your dedication to the GTI once again."

3179, "You did well in this mission, pilot.  Though one cruiser escaped, we will destroy it when we make our assault."

3180, "If you disable any cruisers before they escape, you should be able to fulfill your objectives.  Disruptor missiles and Stilettos can be used to great effect."

3181, "You also destroyed Hellfire's fighter escort.  This will make the assault against Ikeya much easier for our bombers."

3182, "Harr!  The FS2 Volition Bravos is the scurviest ship in the known universe.  Furl yer sails, strike yer colors, and prepare to be boarded by the FreeSpace 2 team!"

3183, "Fortunately, you were able to destroy Hellfire's fighter escort.  This will help even the odds a bit."

3184, "Unfortunately, you failed to destroy Hellfire's fighter escort.  These ships will undoubtedly return to cause trouble for our forces in the upcoming invasion.  Such carelessness ill suits a GTI officer.  This incident will be noted in your record."

3185, "This mission did not go as planned.  Two Shivan cruisers managed to reinforce the fleet in Ikeya, and scans indicate they are now blockading the other side of the jump node.  They now have the high ground, and we expect heavy losses in our initial push."

3186, "Cover your bombers and they'll work on the cruisers.  Disruptor missiles can be used to temporarily shut down cruisers, buying valuable time.  Phoenix V missiles are also very effective against the turrets."

3187, "This mission was a disaster!  We dedicated four wings to this operation, and you only succeeded in destroying a single cruiser.  We do not have the resources to wage war with the Shivans much longer, and failures like these cost us ships, weapons, and lives."

3188, "Your performance in this mission was atrocious.  You realized the importance of this mission yet you failed to destroy a single cruiser.  This disgrace has permanently stained your service record."

3189, "However, we are so short-handed on pilots that we can't afford to ground you.  Instead, your squadron will consist of the first attack wave on the reinforced Shivan positions."

3190, "Beta and Delta wings are carrying Tsunami bombs with which to destroy the cruisers.  You must protect them by drawing away the fighter escort and attacking turrets when possible."

3191, "With the Ribos system secure, the way is now clear for our forces to begin the assault on Ikeya.  The Intrepid and the Hope have been deployed to Ribos to spearhead this operation.  Scouts have determined that no Shivan vessels above cruiser class remain in this area of space, so the system should be ours within a matter of days.

* 5/16/35

Ross 128

With our victory in the Ikeya system, allied forces have succeeded in eradicating the Shivan presence from almost every corner of Terran-Vasudan space.  Only one Shivan stronghold remains: the Ross 128 system, site of the first Shivan attack on our territory.

The GTA and PVE have deployed all available ships to Delta Serpentis in preparation for the invasion of Ross 128.  The assault will be led by the GTD Bastion and the PVD Pinnacle, the finest ships in the Terran and Vasudan fleets."

3212, "On the Vanguard

Intelligence believes the Shivans have enough supplies and warships in Ross 128 to mount a significant defense.  Special Ops has been tasked with doing whatever it can to reduce the amount of resistance our fleets will encounter as they scour the system.

Our operations will be divided into two phases.  In the first phase, our squadrons will perform a reconnaissance-in-force of the system to determine the optimum allied attack strategy.  In the second phase, after the invasion begins, our squadrons will conduct strategic assaults against key Shivan positions.

We will be deploying all available wings on continuous rotation, so when you leave here, report to your squadron leaders for immediate mission briefings.  The Krios itself will remain standing by in a hidden location should problems arise during the invasion."

3213, "New Technology: Cluster Bomb

Research and Development has made available two new weapons to assist our forces in the invasion.

A variant of the Synaptic Bomb, GTI's cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against groups or wings of enemy ships.  Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a field of high-intensity explosive charges, making the Cluster Bomb most effective against fighter formations and freighters.  The Cluster Bomb has a large blast radius and can destroy your fighter if detonated at close range."

3214, "New Technology: Electromagnetic Pulse Missile

The EMP Missile has just completed field testing, and R&D's scientists are conducting a final evaluation of its design.  The missile is designed to produce a large electromagnetic pulse that scrambles sensors, communications, and navigation systems, crippling all small craft caught in the blast radius.

We are expecting a shipment of the missiles from the Repulse shortly and anticipate the weapon will be available for use when you return from your next series of missions."

3215, "In preparation for the main GTA thrust into Ross 128, our squadron is being dispatched to scout out the area.  Your assignment is to scan a suspected nexus of Shivan activity near the site of the original attack on Outpost Riviera.  Because our communications network in Ross 128 was destroyed when the Shivans first attacked, you will be out of contact with Command for the duration of this mission."

3216, "Gather as much data as you can.  We do not know the extent of the Shivan presence in this sector, so be cautious.  Expect to encounter the standard complement of freighters, transports, and fighters.  Scan all warships in the area as well as any debris that you find.  If you get the opportunity, scan the cargo in the area as well."

3217, "The GTI places a high priority on this operation, pilots.  It is preferable to gather a small amount of data and return safely than to gather too much information and fail to make it out alive.  We need whatever you can give us, no matter how insignificant it may seem.  Dismissed."

3218, "You failed to gather any worthwhile data on this sortie, pilot.  Without scans of both cruisers, the GTI cannot form any reasonable theory as to what happened during your mission.  The GTA will now be at a strategic disadvantage when it begins its invasion.  Dismissed!"

3219, "Scanning both cruisers isn't hard.  Just order all your wingmen to protect you and get in and out quick.

Scanning the transport and cargo is a little more difficult.  Get the transport as soon as you arrive, then order your wingmen to destroy the freighters so you can scan the cargo in relative peace.  Scan the cruisers last -- they aren't going anywhere."

3220, "This mission was a surprise for both of us, pilot.  Thanks to your scans, we have verified that the cruisers you encountered are GTI ships, originally registered as GTC Odin and GTC Thor.  Official records, however, show that these cruisers were destroyed in two separate engagements at the beginning of the Great War.  The fact that these ships were present in a highly sensitive sector of Shivan-controlled space at the same time as your deployment is more than a little suspicious.  We can only assume that this operation was carried out by a rogue element of the GTI."

3221, "Thanks to your scan of the Shivan transport, Intelligence may soon be able to determine the motivation and intent of the rogue operation.  We are already preparing a preliminary report to deliver to Terran Command.  Excellent work."

3222, "Thanks to your scan of the Shivan cargo, Intelligence may soon be able to determine the motivation and intent of the rogue operation.  We are already preparing a preliminary report to deliver to Terran Command.  Excellent work."

3244, "The last Shivan Demon bites the dust, with a little help from the EMP Missile.  But something's not right..."

3245, "Allied forces all over the system have reported major victories in their attacks against the Shivans.  The $f GTD $f Bastion and her battlegroup have already destroyed a number of cruisers, fighter wings, and cargo depots.  The $f PVD $f Pinnacle and her battlegroup have reported similar successes.

But to completely secure Ross 128, we must decapitate the Shivan infrastructure.  Intelligence believes the source of command for the Shivans in this sector to be the $h SD $h Archon, a Demon-class destroyer.  This ship will be the target of our next operation."

3246, "The $h Archon is a hive of Shivan activity, with reconnaissance sighting several freighters, transports, cargo formations and sentry guns, and at least two Cain-class cruisers: the $h SC $h Golem and the $h SC $h Chimera.

You will lead a GTI task force into the area and eliminate all ships you encounter.  Normally you would be significantly outmatched in such an operation, but we have something special in store."

3247, "The new $b EMP $b Missile has been completed, and this mission will serve as a final evaluation.  Wings $f Iota and $f Kappa from the $b 122nd $b Crazy $b Ivans, monitored by the $f GTSC $f Giordano, will saturate the area with electromagnetic pulses prior to your deployment."

3248, "The EMP cloud will impair all sensors on Terran and Shivan craft.  The Shivans should not be able to target you, but you won't be able to target them either.  For this reason, your loadout should include dumbfire or heat-seeking missiles.  Our scientists predict the effect will last between two and five minutes."

3249, "$f Alpha, $f Beta, and $f Gamma wings will relieve the $b 122nd and inflict as much damage as possible while the EMP field is active.  Once the effect wears off and aspect lock is possible, $f Delta and $f Epsilon wings will deploy their heavy ordnance.  Command has authorized the use of $f GTB $f Ursa heavy bombers for this mission."

3250, "This is the coup de grace, pilots.  Once the $h Archon has been destroyed, the allied fleet should have no trouble isolating and eliminating the remnants of the Shivan fleet.  If you succeed here today, we will have nothing more to fear.  Good luck."

I cannot imagine what you must be thinking, pilots.  To return to your command ship after what was to have been a great victory, only to find it under attack from your fellow officers.  Though you fought valiantly, the Krios and most of her crew were lost.  They died a bitter death, betrayed by the very organization they swore to defend.

This development has grave implications for the future of the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  Terran Command has already been notified of our situation and will be updated as we debrief the survivors of the Krios.  I will address the crew of the Soyakaze tomorrow with our findings.

In recognition of your contributions to the allied victory over the Shivans, the GTA has awarded you the Medal of Honor.  Take comfort in the fact that, though your return is not as triumphant as it should be, we will never have to fear the Shivans ever again."

3310, "This is Admiral Tess of the GTD Soyakaze.

I cannot imagine what you must be thinking, pilots.  To return to your command ship after what was to have been a great victory, only to find it under attack from Terran ships.  Though you fought valiantly, the Krios and her crew were lost.  The phantom attackers have since disappeared without a trace.

This development has grave implications for the future of the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  If a rogue cell is active in our military, it has the potential to significantly destabilize our reconstruction efforts.  Terran Command has ordered a full investigation, but without the crew or flight records from the Krios, I am afraid we have little to go on."

Victory

At 0525 hours this morning, GTA High Command declared a decisive victory over the Shivans in Ross 128 and Ikeya.  The species which annihilated the Ancients, which devastated Vasuda Prime, which nearly succeeded in driving mankind to extinction, has been defeated.  Recon units have found no trace of any remaining Shivan activity.

With the Shivans gone, we should be able to start rebuilding our shattered systems and working on forging a lasting alliance with the Vasudans.  But there has been a terrible new development."

3346, "Ambush

While allied forces throughout Ross 128 engaged the Shivans, fighters and bombers launched from the GTD Repulse secretly attacked, disabled, and destroyed the Krios.  Only through the intervention of the Soyakaze were the survivors recovered.  We believe the Krios was destroyed to cover up information it had gathered about rogue activity in the Research and Development branch of GTI.

Once we had contacted GTA High Command, the Repulse and the R&D fleet immediately sprang into action, pulling out of Ross 128 and heading to Delta Serpentis.  Command has authorized all GTA units to consider these forces hostile, and to capture or destroy them at any opportunity.

Our agents have pieced together the events leading up to the Krios's destruction by analyzing the evidence salvaged from her.  A summary of the report follows."

3347, "Evidence

The Krios's interrogations of the Einstein's survivors suggest that Research and Development knew about the existence of the Shivans even before their initial appearance at Ross 128.  Several science vessels, including the Einstein, were assigned to secretly study this new species and its technology.  We believe the Einstein was deployed to Ross 128 and then reported destroyed so that the ship could continue its research operations without fear of outside supervision.

While R&D was instrumental in enabling the GTA and PVE fleets to quickly close the technological gap on the Shivans during the Great War, events strongly suggested that the Repulse and its fleet were keeping their most significant discoveries to themselves.  Based on the Einstein's appearance at the Vasudan research site in Deneb, Admiral Scott theorized that there could be an unknown number of ghost R&D ships conducting research unaccountable to the rest of the GTA.  This theory was given further support when pilots from the Krios blundered upon a secret recovery operation in Ross 128 and came under fire from rogue ships."

3348, "Betrayal

With the Krios slowly assembling evidence, the rogue elements grew in increasing danger of being exposed.  The Repulse sought to destroy this information before it reached critical mass and soon found the perfect opportunity.

With the Krios's fighter wings and support craft engaging the Shivans in Ross 128, the destroyer was left virtually undefended.  The rebels launched bombers against the Krios while sanitizing several SpecOps operations and jamming the transmissions of others under the guise of monitoring scientific data.  Only the pilots attacking the SD Archon returned early enough to witness the destruction of the Krios, and it was only because of their quick thinking that we were able to recover enough evidence to implicate Research and Development.  We have taken care to spread that information far enough that it can no longer be covered up.  The silent threat has been forced into the open."

3349, "Rebellion

We do not yet know the full extent of the insurrection, nor the rebels' motives or objectives.  Unfortunately, our maneuvers against the Shivans have left our fleets at serious risk of guerilla attacks from within.  While the GTA consolidates its forces, the Soyakaze has been tasked with gathering all the data we can about the enemy's objectives.  We cannot allow them the element of surprise.

Report for mission briefings immediately."

3350, "At ease, pilots, and welcome to the 82nd Nighthawks.  I understand you're still a little shaken up after the destruction of the $f Krios, but rest assured -- the $h R&D rebels will get what's coming to them, sooner or later.  $f Terran $f Command and the officers of the $f Soyakaze are still analyzing data regarding the $h R&D insurrection and preparing a counterattack.  You'll be fully briefed when the time comes."

3351, "A situation is developing in $b Delta $b Serpentis.  Slipping behind our rear defenses, the $h Repulse launched a surprise attack against the diplomatic installations orbiting Delta Serpentis IV.  $f Terran and $f Vasudan forces responded quickly, but by the time they arrived, the orbital annex of the Vasudan Embassy had been wiped out.

The loss of life was less than would be expected from such an attack, but our communications with the Vasudan government have been thrown into disarray.  Needless to say, the incident has not improved Terran-Vasudan relations either."

3352, "Although the $h Repulse has since gone into hiding, the GTA isn't taking any chances.  The survivors of the attack are currently being relocated to fortified positions within the Terran-Vasudan fleet.  Diplomats, officers, and supply convoys are currently en route to a secure rendezvous point within the Delta Serpentis system, where they will be joined by the $f GTC $f Challenger and the $f PVC $f Bastet."

3353, "Unfortunately, $h R&D has access to our fleet communications network, so it is quite likely that the convoys will fall under attack.  You must defend the convoys until the Challenger and Bastet arrive.  Once the cruisers have relieved you, you may return to the $f Soyakaze.

Do not fail, pilots.  Dismissed."

3354, "Your primary objective was to defend the convoys against rebel attack, and you failed.  Hundreds of innocent lives were lost due to your incompetent performance.  Worse, Terran relations with the Vasudan government may have been damaged beyond repair.

You and your wing are grounded pending a formal inquiry into these events.  As wing leader, you will be court-martialed and charged with willful negligence of duty.  Frankly, you'll be lucky to get a dishonorable discharge."

3355, "Pay particular attention to Bragi, Roskva and Buri wings.  Be careful not to get distracted by dogfighting."

3356, "Good job, Alpha.  Thanks to you, the majority of the survivors were successfully evacuated.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3357, "Your protection of the freighters ensured that the refugees were well-supplied when they arrived at their shelter.  Well done."

3358, "Excellent work, Alpha.  Through your efforts, every single ship that was in your care made it to safe havens in Delta Serpentis.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3359, "Alpha 4 exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer of the GTA, and has been disciplined accordingly.  Let me remind you that all pilots have a responsibility to adhere to the highest standards of behavior, especially in their interactions with Vasudans.

With the repositioning of the GTA and PVE fleets in Delta Serpentis, the way is clear for our forces to begin the counterattack.  The next briefing will be at 1400 hours this afternoon.  Don't be late."

3375, "You are late, Terrans.  Our vessels have already assembled themselves."

3376, "Late?  We launched as soon as we received our orders."

3377, "We expected you to be here upon our arrival.  During our rendezvous, we were vulnerable to enemy attack."

3378, "Hey, pal, give us a break.  We know less about this than you do.  We got here as quickly as we could."

3379, "Then let us be glad the rebels were not quicker."

3380, "I think we got them all.  Alpha wing, resume escort formation."

3381, "I don't see why we have to guard the Vasudan ships too.  Don't they have their own fighters?"

3382, "Most of the fleet was caught off-guard when R&D attacked.  I'm sure the Vasudan fighters are off doing something important."

3383, "Yeah, like spying on us.  If you ask me, we should never have let them into Delta Serpentis."

3384, "I didn't ask you, and shut up.  They can hear you."

3385, "I don't care if they can.  They can't do anything on their own, that's why they came running to us as soon as the Shivans attacked.  That's why they need us to guard every single one of their stupid convoys!"

3386, "You have a loud mouth, Terran.  If you knew the truth you would not say such things."

3387, "I'll say whatever I want, fish-lover.  If if weren't for us, you wouldn't have a fleet to run home to.  You couldn't even stop the Lucifer from glassing your planet!"

3388, "Pilot, that is enough!  Your behavior is risking an interspecies incident!  Focus on your mission and maintain radio silence."

3389, "Forced Hand"

3390, "The GTA conducts a surprise attack on a secret shipyard in Delta Serpentis."

3391, "The $h Research $h and $h Development branch of GTI has now staged an all-out open rebellion against the $f GTA.  Terran Command reports that all $h R&D ships are pulling out of allied operations and regrouping in $b Delta $b Serpentis and $b Beta $b Aquilae.

We suspect that the rebels are setting up rallying points throughout these systems, but they have proven quite adept at evading our efforts to track them down."

3392, "Fortunately, the $f Intelligence branch of GTI employs the most skilled reconnaissance and espionage operatives in the entire GTA.  Scouts from the $f Soyakaze have located a major rallying point in a remote corner of $b Delta $b Serpentis, guarded by none other than the $h Repulse herself.

Command has ordered us to capture the Repulse to determine the full extent of the insurrection.  The operation will proceed as follows."

3393, "A small strike force will arrive to confront the $h Repulse directly and draw its attention.  Meanwhile, $f Alpha wing will arrive on the far side of the engagement zone and attempt to slip in undetected.  The strike force will attempt to distract the Repulse long enough for you to disable and disarm it.  Transports will then arrive to board and capture the ship."

3394, "In addition to the $h Repulse, reconnaissance reports several freighters, three cruisers, and a large drydock of unknown configuration.  The drydock is unarmed and should pose no threat, but the other ships must be destroyed.  Additional units will be deployed to neutralize these threats, but you may be required to assist them once your have completed your objectives.  Vasudan forces will blockade the jump nodes to $b Beta $b Aquilae and $b Ross $b 128 to prevent any ships from escaping."

3395, "Exercise care during this mission, pilots.  The $h Repulse is commanded by $h Admiral $h Marcus $h Glaive, the highest-ranking field officer in $h R&D.  You can be sure that he will deploy his most capable forces, including his $b Loki-class stealth fighters, to defend his position.

Although our engineers are searching for a weakness in the Loki's stealth technology, their efforts have so far proven unsuccessful.  Regardless of the situation, you must do everything in your power to ensure that this mission succeeds.  The security of the GTA may depend on it."

3396, "Excellent work, pilots.  Our forces executed a clean sweep of the battle area.  Despite heavy resistance, we managed to capture the Repulse and destroy its cruiser escort.  The Vasudans report that all ships attempting to escape the system were neutralized by the blockades.

Unfortunately, we were unable to capture Admiral Glaive himself.  While you were distracted by transport Omega, a single Hermes escape pod left the Repulse's hangar and jumped to an unknown location.  Attempts to track the pod have so far proven unsuccessful.  However, Intelligence believes the interrogation of the Repulse's crew will provide us with sufficient information to plan our next move."

3397, "At present, we have determined that the Repulse was not rendezvousing at a rallying point, as we had initially assumed, but rather guarding a shipyard in the process of being evacuated.  Freighters had been moving supplies out of the area for several days, and the drydock was being rigged to self-destruct.

The drydock itself is something of an enigma.  Although it is constructed of standard Polaris modules, no designs exist for a configuration of this size and scope.  Scans indicate that the drydock was recently occupied by a large vessel, but all maintenance and repair records have been erased.

Quite what this means at this point is unknown, but Command has urged us to continue our investigation with caution."

3398, "You and your squadron destroyed the Repulse, despite specific orders to preserve it for capture.

This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  Although we have removed the rebel leadership, guerrilla forces continue to harass our ships and attack our convoys throughout Delta Serpentis and Beta Aquilae.  Tracking down these forces will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had our operation succeeded.

Your squadron is being removed from active duty until further notice.  Dismissed."

3399, "Don't destroy the Repulse.  Use Stilettos instead of Tsunamis, and pay attention to your wingmen."

3400, "You and your squadron failed to disable the Repulse before it escaped."

3401, "You and your squadron failed to intercept Omega before it could repair the Repulse."

3402, "This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  We will have to attempt the operation a second time, but the Repulse is now fully aware of our plans and will undoubtedly have called for reinforcements.  We have no choice but to attempt a direct frontal assault, one which will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had this operation succeeded the first time.

Your squadron is being removed from active duty until further notice.  Dismissed."

3411, "You're hardly in a position to be making demands, Captain.  Do you really expect us to back down against a mere two cruisers?"

3412, "We have more backup in transit, Admiral.  You can save yourself the trouble by powering down now."

3413, "Captain, be reasonable.  The fleet has been wiped out and we've lost all contact with Earth.  Fighting against us is futile."

3414, "Surrender or be destroyed.  This is your final warning."

3415, "I don't have time for this.  All fighters, engage and destroy the allied warships."

3416, "The Lokis are breaking off to engage the cruisers.  Now's your chance, Alpha.  Disable the Repulse before they notice you."

3417, "The Lokis have detected your presence!  The Repulse is charging its subspace drive -- pilots, go to FULL BURN and take out its engines before it can jump!"

3452, "Excellent work, pilot.  Despite fierce resistance, you were able to protect the Hope long enough for us to recover it to a secure location.  It will be a long time before the destroyer is ready for service again, but your efforts saved thousands of lives and a significant portion of our war materiel.

We have no conclusive data regarding the Serkr warhead deployed in this engagement.  It seems to be between 25 and 50 percent more powerful than the Tsunami.  Your efforts prevented R&D from using this weapon to its fullest capability."

3453, "You also neutralized every enemy vessel attempting to run the blockade.  Most impressive.  This will significantly impede rebel operations in Beta Aquilae."

3454, "Unfortunately, many of the rebel ships managed to run our blockade and escape to the Beta Aquilae system.  Our efforts to track them through subspace have proven ineffective."

3455, "The survivors rescued from the Aten cruisers appear to be suffering from severe shock and post-traumatic stress and are currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation.  They are lucky to be alive, and the PVE has expressed gratitude for their safe recovery."

3456, "Many of the survivors on board the Aten cruisers were killed before they could be safely recovered.  Their loss will be keenly felt."

3457, "Protect the Aten cruisers until the survivors can be extracted."

3458, "The scans from the GTSC Hinton are highly alarming.  It appears that the damage done to the blockade was inflicted by Shivan flux cannon weaponry, similar to that observed on the Lucifer superdestroyer.  Our scientists are poring over the data, and the Repulse crew is being interrogated on the matter.  Further information on the proceedings has been classified, so I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis."

3459, "The PVD Hope and her crew of over 9,000 officers and crew were lost to the fierce rebel offensive.  This tragedy is a terrible blow to the alliance.  In the aftermath of our war with the Shivans and the advent of the R&D rebellion, the loss of yet another destroyer and the resources it held puts a tremendous strain on our remaining fleets.

The loss of the Hope and the near-complete destruction of an entire Vasudan blockade force indicates the rebellion is much more powerful than we had initially assumed.  Command has ordered the Terran fleets to withdraw to Delta Serpentis, where we will attempt to consolidate our forces."

Origin of the Rebellion

With the material and information obtained from the capture of the Repulse, our counterintelligence agents have finally determined the origin and extent of the rebellion.  The discovery is deeply troubling.  Rogue activity within the GTI is not confined to the Research and Development branch, but involves officers in the highest echelon of the intelligence directorate.

Effective immediately, the GTA has terminated all support of GTI operations and declared an open state of war against the organization.  All forces loyal to the GTA, including the Soyakaze and the remnants of the Intelligence and Special Ops fleets, have been reintegrated into the main GTA battlegroup."

3518, "The GTI

Because of the technology and sensitive information within its grasp, the GTI poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the GTA, the PVE, and all allied worlds.  GTI's assets include, in addition to the ship and weapon prototypes developed by R&D, the top military scientists and strategic planners in the GTA.  They are not to be underestimated.

Against the GTI, our most effective weapon will be the numerical superiority of the combined GTA and PVE fleets.  Our actions must be swift and decisive."

3519, "New Developments

Our tactical situation will be greatly improved by the latest discovery from the Soyakaze's personnel.  Analysis of the GTF Loki has enabled our engineers to identify a design flaw in the Loki's structural composition.  This flaw renders the Loki's stealth technology effectively useless, as a simple reconfiguration of sensor parameters allows the Loki to be targeted by any of our ships.  All sensor systems in the GTA and PVE fleets have been upgraded with this new information."

3520, "Our Mission

Command has disclosed the location of the GTI's base of operations: the Jotunheim installation in the Beta Aquilae system.  The existence and location of this installation were, until now, classified at the highest level.  Our analysts believe that the majority of the rebel leadership and infrastructure are concentrated at this base.

If we are to have any chance of stopping the GTI, Jotunheim must be destroyed.  The GTA will launch an immediate, all-out offensive to take out the installation and its surrounding defenses.  Report to your wing stations for your specific briefings."

3521, "The $f Soyakaze has been ordered to destroy the $h Jotunheim, GTI's base of operations in $b Beta $b Aquilae.  GTI conducts their most secret operations, including xenobiological research and engineering, at this facility.  We believe the GTI has been studying Shivan technology and physiology here since first contact."

3522, "This operation will be performed in conjunction with the $f GTD $f Intrepid and the $f PVD $f Vanguard.  While the Terran and Vasudan fleets engage enemy targets throughout Beta Aquilae, our pilots will conduct a strike against Jotunheim itself.  A massive, coordinated assault on several fronts should overwhelm the GTI forces in this system and significantly improve our odds against the installation."

3523, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least six full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3524, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least four full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3525, "In the second phase, $f Zeta and $f Omicron will jump in and attack the installation's cruiser fortifications.  Once the cruisers are down, they will target and destroy the Jotunheim.  Alpha and Beta will remain on station to provide cover."

3526, "Because of the shortage of bombers on board the Soyakaze, Zeta and Omicron wings will be supplied by the Intrepid and the Vanguard respectively.  These pilots are veterans of the Great War with the Shivans and the fourteen-year war between our species, and have already seen action against the GTI on several fronts.  They are more than qualified to assist you on this mission."

3527, "If you need additional fighter support during any part of the mission, $f Gamma wing will be available as reinforcement.  Command will also deploy $f Delta and $f Epsilon, at their discretion, if the need arises."

3528, "We have only a limited tactical profile of the installation, so be prepared to engage exotic prototypes with unknown capabilities.  You are authorized to destroy any GTI vessel that interferes with your mission objectives.  However, your primary objective is to eliminate the Jotunheim.  All other targets are secondary.

Good luck, pilots."

3529, "Jotunheim has been destroyed, and with it, most of the GTI's weapon prototypes and technological research.  Unfortunately, our attempt to decapitate the GTI leadership failed, as some of the officers aboard the installation were able to escape its destruction and evade capture.  Worse, the insurgents have a new superweapon at their disposal.  The vessel that retrieved the Jotunheim's escape pods is a juggernaut of incredible proportions, capable of annihilating one of our cruisers in a single shot.  Firepower of this magnitude has heretofore been seen only on the SD Lucifer.

Reconnaissance wings have already been scrambled to track and identify this new class of ship.  Admiral Tess has informed me that our squadron may be called up to attack the superdestroyer at any time.  Dismissed."

3547, "Between the war with the Vasudans and the war with the Shivans, the GTA is on its last legs.  The best intelligence forecasts only give the GTA two years before it disintegrates!  The only organization capable of restoring order is the GTI.  You need our help!"

3548, "Excellent work!  Jotunheim's defenses have been destroyed.  Target the installation and fire at will.  Watch for enemy reinforcements."

3549, "Command, listen.  We have the prototype.  It's ready to deploy.  You can end the Vasudan war within a matter of weeks -- months at the most -- but victory is assured.  You can't simply ignore that."

3550, "It's not my call.  Times have changed, Jotunheim.  We're no longer at war with the Vasudans.  We're allies, not enemies."

3551, "We're allies in name only.  You know this cease-fire is only going to last until one race recovers enough to strike the final blow against the other.  If one of our species has to be destroyed, let's make damn sure we're the ones alive at the end."

3552, "Terran pilots, surely you can see what's going on here!  Think of your friends, your loved ones, who fought and died for fourteen years to support the Terran cause!  Now your commanders want to throw away everything they stood for!"

3553, "Pilots, you will ignore the Jotunheim's transmissions and focus on your mission objectives."

3554, "I don't know, Command.  They didn't mention any of this in the briefing.  Surely--"

3555, "Complete your mission objectives, pilot!  That's an order!"

3556, "What about the orders of the past fourteen years, huh?  What about everything we fought for?  My fiancee was on the Eisenhower, damn you!"

3557, "Terran paranoia.  How typical.  Be glad that our governments have risen above such sentiments, blind one.  I would not pardon you so freely."

3558, "Go look at your own treacherous Parliament, you sand-eating Zod, and then tell us we're not paranoid.  What are our orders, Jotunheim?"

3561, "Allied forces, the cavalry has arrived.  The Gladiator, Minotaur, Mecross, and Tatenen stand ready to assist.  Bringing full turret barrage to bear on the Jotunheim."

3562, "Jotunheim assault force, this is the Soyakaze.  Be advised our code slicers report a large rebel force en route to your position.  Destroy the Jotunheim ASAP."

3563, "Acknowledged, Soyakaze.  The Jotunheim has gone critical.  Just give us a few more moments."

3564, "Sorry, Command.  We're going to win this war whether you like it or not.  It may take a generation or two, but the Terran race will emerge victorious."

3565, "The Jotunheim has jettisoned escape pods.  Do not engage the pods, pilots.  We'll send in a team of transports to capture them."

3566, "The Jotunheim has been destroyed!  All units, stand clear!"

3567, "Command, I'm picking up an enormous jump signature here!  The readings are off the scale!"

Apocalypse

The GTA and PVE have been plunged into chaos by the appearance of the GTI's latest superweapon.  The unthinkable has happened.  Somehow, Galactic Terran Intelligence has managed to acquire a vessel with the size, armor, and firepower to rival the SD Lucifer.  Preliminary scans indicate that it is a fusion of Terran and Shivan technologies unlike anything in our arsenal."

3574, "The Hades

We now know that this vessel, designated the Hades, is the attacker that crippled the PVD Hope and destroyed the Vasudan blockade at the Beta Aquilae node.  The Hades has since gone on to obliterate several allied strongholds throughout Beta Aquilae and Vega.

Terran and Vasudan forces are scrambling to develop a strategy to counter this new threat.  All pilots have been placed on ten-minute alert."

3575, "$r RED $r ALERT!  The $f PVI $f Egyptos is under attack!  Recon has sighted multiple $h GTI fighter and bomber wings converging on the station."

3576, "We are scrambling $f Alpha and $f Beta wings to reinforce the station's depleted fighter complement.  Unfortunately, we have no conclusive intelligence on the strength of $h GTI forces in this system.  If Command determines that the $h GTI have sufficient firepower to threaten our position, the station may need to be evacuated."

3577, "Most of our ships are scouring the system in search of the $h Hades, so you will have minimal logistical support.  Hold off the $h GTI until additional fighters can be deployed to assist you."

3578, "The PVI Egyptos has been destroyed.  Thousands of innocent Vasudans perished today, and the Vega node is now defenseless against the GTI onslaught."

3579, "It is unfortunate that you fell victim to the same tactic we used against the Vasudans only four years ago.  The Karnak-class installation's main weakness, as exploited by the GTA in Operation Cardinal Spear, is standard material in any League of Defense flight school curriculum.  Were you asleep in your military history class, pilot?

Whether you were caught off guard or simply failed to intercept the bomber in time is not the issue.  Command issued you a direct order, and you were unable to react with the speed and precision that the situation required.  In this present conflict, we cannot afford the risk that one of our top pilots will fail to respond at a critical moment.

I regret to inform you that Command is pulling you from active duty until we have the rebellion under control.  Dismissed."

3580, "Break off your attack as soon as you hear that the bomber is targeting the reactor.  You have enough time to get to the reactor before he does.

Why not play the FSPort conversion of Cardinal Spear to learn the background behind this mission?  Download it from the FSPort website at http://fsport.hard-light.net/."

3581, "The PVC Thebes was vaporized with all hands on board.  The station evacuees that had boarded the Thebes also perished in the Hades's ferocious assault."

3582, "It is fortunate that you were able to save the PVC Hathor and the escaping transports.  The survivors send their gratitude.

We are also impressed that you were able to defeat the GTI's surprise attack against the Egyptos's reactor.  Your quick thinking and prompt response helped buy precious time for the survivors to escape the GTI's attack.  Well done."

3583, "We are disappointed that you were unable to save the PVC Hathor from the GTI assault.  In the face of today's events, even a few hundred additional survivors would have boosted morale."

3584, "Since the GTI fighters arrive all over the place, it's a matter of luck whether or not you'll be near the Hathor when it's attacked.  Assigning your wingmen to protect it will buy you some time, but you still need to be ready to come to its defense when Roskva wing arrives."

3585, "In appreciation of your performance in our operations with allied Vasudans, you are hereby awarded the Vasudan Alliance Medal.  For your courageous defense of the PVI Egyptos, the PVD Hope, and many other Vasudan vessels, the Parliament of Vasuda sends its thanks."

3586, "Our direct losses to the Hades now include the PVI Egyptos, the PVD Vanguard, and twelve cruisers.  For all our sakes, let us hope that a weakness in its defenses can be found soon.

We have reacquired sensor lock on the juggernaut and are attempting to track it through subspace.  Our squadron will be redeployed ASAP to intercept the vessel when it arrives at its destination.  Report to the briefing room on the double."

3634, "Abandon Hope"

3635, "Our hero must scan the subsystems of the Hades in a desperate attempt to find a weakness."

3636, "Command has located the $h Hades near the jump node to $b Deneb.  The superdestroyer is travelling without escort but remains a formidable adversary on its own.  We cannot risk a direct attack until we have more information on its strengths and weaknesses."

3637, "$f Alpha $f 1, you have been selected to fly reconnaissance against the Hades.  Command has requested data regarding the $b communications, $b sensors, $b weapons, and $b navigation subsystems of the warship.  Information on the $b fighterbay and $b engine subsystems would also be valuable, but they are not as critical."

3638, "The $f GTSC $f Herschel will oversee this operation.  Your fighter's computer will be linked to the Herschel's computer, and your fighter will automatically upload your scan data as it is acquired."

3639, "To protect itself from the Hades's powerful beam weaponry, the Herschel will attempt to mask its sensor signature.  This will prevent the Hades's computers from acquiring target lock on the vessel, and the Herschel's small size should make manual targeting nearly impossible.  If we're lucky, the gunners on the Hades won't bother with her."

3640, "Choose your loadout quickly, pilot.  We won't have much time before the Hades leaves the system.  This is the best chance we have to get the intelligence we need.  Let's make the most of it."

3641, "The events we have just witnessed have dramatically underscored the necessity of defeating the GTI rebellion.  The Hades survived both the collision with and the explosion of a fully-armed Typhon-class destroyer.  The crew of the PVD Hope sacrificed their lives and their ship in a valiant attempt to bring victory to the GTA and PVE.  Though they were unsuccessful, they will be remembered with honor.

Unfortunately, Command must still deal with the consequences of the failed strike.  Although the Hope had unloaded her pilots and non-essential personnel before moving against the Hades, we have lost a well-trained and highly skilled command crew.  With our weakened fleets dispersed over several systems to contain the rebellion, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we will not be able to marshal sufficient forces quickly enough to confront the Hades.  We have no choice but to attack with what we have.  Command hopes that between the intelligence acquired from the Repulse and the scan data obtained from our reconnaissance, we should be able to find a weakness in the Hades before it reaches its destination."

3642, "However, you failed to scan the required subsystems on the Hades, forcing us to depend on the long-range sensor data transmitted by the Herschel.  Without the tactical intelligence we had hoped to obtain, our analysts will lack the information they need to plan an effective counterattack.

You were selected for this mission based on your impressive record of successful reconnaissance missions, and Command is extremely disappointed in your failure to live up to your reputation.  Perhaps your abilities are better demonstrated in standard assault and defense missions rather than situations requiring quick thinking and tactical improvisation.

Admiral Tess has approved your transfer back to the GTD Intrepid.  The containment effort will benefit greatly from someone with your piloting skill, but for our attack against the Hades we need pilots who excel in all areas of combat engagement.  The Soyakaze will jump to Deneb in six hours, so you have until then to collect your belongings.  Your transport will be waiting in the hangar."

3643, "Take out the first few fighters immediately, and then scan a subsystem or two in the interval between waves.  If you keep doing this, you should be able to get at least three subsystems.  Make sure you scan the communications, sensors, weapons, and navigation subsystems before any others."

3644, "Our reconnaissance was mostly successful, as you scanned three of the required four subsystems on the Hades.  Although we had hoped for a complete tactical profile of the juggernaut, your performance was satisfactory, considering the circumstances.  Our analysts will have a difficult time planning an effective counterattack, but the data you obtained should significantly improve our odds."

3645, "Our reconnaissance was a complete success, as you scanned all four of the required subsystems on the Hades.  Excellent work.  Our tacticians are analyzing the data you acquired as we speak, and we expect to receive a preliminary report in a few hours.  This information will significantly improve our odds in the upcoming counterattack."

3646, "Additionally, you were able to scan the Hades's fighterbay.  Intelligence has expressed great alarm at your findings, but their analysis remains classified for the time being."

3647, "You were also able to scan one of the Hades's engines.  Our engineers are incorporating your findings into their analysis as they search for a weakness in the juggernaut's defenses.  This information may explain why the Hades was temporarily disabled."

3648, "Admiral Tess has taken special note of your performance over the last few missions and has selected you to lead the attack against the Hades.  Your familiarity with the juggernaut's defenses will give us an extra edge in the upcoming battle, and your proven leadership and piloting skill are unequaled in this squadron.

Command has allowed our strategists and tacticians six hours to formulate a battle plan, after which the Soyakaze will jump to Deneb to pursue the Hades.  In the meantime, I suggest you get some rest.  Dismissed."

GTI Rebellion

The GTA, PVE, and GTI are now engaged in an all-out conflict that could determine the future of Terran-Vasudan history.  Although the bulk of the GTI fleet has been contained in Beta Aquilae and Vega, the GTI flagship Hades is still at large and must be stopped.  The Soyakaze is the only ship within range to intercept the juggernaut before she can carry out her ultimate objective.  Victory or defeat will be decided in the next few hours.

You are being informed on a need-to-know basis about the Hades project, and are hereby notified that all information regarding it is classified Level Omega.  Divulging this information, directly or indirectly, to any persons other than those specifically authorized by the Galactic Terran Alliance is a treasonous offense, punishable by death."

3694, "Project Hades

The GTD Hades was conceived and designed in 2324, when it became apparent that the Terran-Vasudan War would not be won decisively in a matter of months.  This superdestroyer would be nearly invulnerable to bomber, cruiser, and destroyer attacks, and would be able to mount full-scale planetary assaults unaided.  Construction began the following year, in the Delta Serpentis shipyards.

When the Shivans arrived in 2335, the Hades was nearing completion.  The GTI conducted extensive studies of the aliens, particularly of the Lucifer, and put the new developments to use in the Hades.  With their ultimate weapon now boasting Shivan beam weaponry and Terran-Shivan hybrid systems, GTI forces waited for the deployment order from GTA High Command.

But the order never came.  Unlike every other cease-fire over the course of the Terran-Vasudan War, this one held.  The GTA and PVE set aside their differences to counter the Shivan threat, and in the process developed a grudging respect for each other."

3695, "GTI's Objective

Galactic Terran Intelligence, however, could not easily discard the investment and momentum of ten years' worth of work on the Hades.  According to statements by captured operatives, the GTI concluded that the GTA had lost sight of its original goal and decided to take matters into its own hands.

The GTI appears to have been positioning itself to overthrow the GTA government, as soon as the Terrans had recovered enough from the Great War to stand on their own.  Once the Shivans were defeated, the GTI would dissolve the Terran-Vasudan treaty and strike the final blow against the PVE.  The Terran-Vasudan War would finally be won."

3696, "A Final Gambit

The exposure of the GTI conspiracy has prevented their plan from coming to fruition, but the GTI may yet succeed in their ultimate objective.  Our reconnaissance against the Hades has indicated that its engines are enhanced with Shivan components, which may enable the juggernaut to use jump nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels.  Command believes that, rather than pursuing a random course of destruction, the Hades is actually en route to Altair and Aldebaran via the Deneb-Altair phasing jump node.

This maneuver would effectively allow the Hades to slip behind Vasudan lines, beyond any possibility of interception by GTA or PVE forces.  The Deneb-Altair jump node is no longer stable enough for our ships to traverse, which means that any counterattack would have to go the long way around via Alpha Centauri.  By then, the Hades will have had more than enough time to devastate the Vasudan home systems unopposed."

3697, "Our Response

There are some within the GTA who favor the GTI in this conflict.  Indeed, many officers and pilots have defected to the GTI, and many others have argued that the Vasudans would behave the same as the GTI if they were in the same position.  I can only answer by saying that I believe this is the right thing to do, and I believe the Vasudans would defend us if the situation were reversed.

It may be difficult for each species to see past the horrors of the past fourteen years, but the Vasudans seem to be holding up their end of the bargain.  The PVE continued to work closely with the GTA in our campaign to track and destroy the Lucifer, even after the devastation of Vasuda Prime removed their main motivation for doing so.  And the GTA and PVE continue to share military resources and intelligence even today.  We should honor their continued support with our own.  History will determine whether we made the right choice in doing so."

3698, "The $h Hades has been tracked to an abandoned cargo depot in orbit around $b Deneb $b III.  This once-prosperous colony was utterly destroyed by the Shivans earlier this year, and the shattered remains of many warships drift nearby.  The Hades's engines are currently offline, and we believe she is repairing the damage sustained in the collision with the $f PVD $f Hope.  This may be our only chance to destroy the juggernaut before it reaches $b Altair."

3699, "The $f Soyakaze is making the subspace jump to $b Deneb as we speak.  Advance fighter wings will be launched immediately upon the Soyakaze's arrival in the system, and the Soyakaze herself will move into position to challenge the Hades directly as soon as her jump drives are recharged.  The Hades has five main beam cannons that must be destroyed for the Soyakaze to have a chance of victory."

3700, "$f Alpha wing will fly tactical assault, using $b Tsunami bombs to destroy the Hades's beam emplacements.  $f Beta wing will cover them.  When the Soyakaze arrives to confront the Hades, $f Delta and $f Epsilon wings will also be deployed."

3701, "We have a limited window of opportunity to destroy the Hades before it concludes its activity at the depot and leaves the system.  The capabilities of this warship are unthinkable, and in the hands of the GTI it is a terrible weapon.

The security of the Terran and Vasudan species is in your hands now, pilots.  You know the consequences of failure.  Good luck."

3702, "Congratulations, pilots!  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered.  Had we failed here, the GTI would be writing the history books."

3703, "Welcome to the GTD Intrepid, pilots.  The destruction of the GTD Soyakaze is a tragedy for everyone in the Alliance, especially for those of you so recently stationed on the GTD Krios.  Fortunately, the Soyakaze was not lost in vain.  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered."

3704, "Members of the provisional GTA government have already begun the process of reconstruction in cooperation with our Vasudan allies.  It is ironic that, far from tearing our two species apart, this conflict has brought them closer together than ever before.  Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group, has expressed interest in personally meeting with the pilots who flew against the Hades -- a rare gesture on the part of a Vasudan."

3705, "Debris from the Hades is still raining down on Deneb III.  Due to the sensitive nature of the technology it contained, the planet will be quarantined until the wreckage can be disposed of.  Terran Command has classified all data regarding the technology used in this engagement, though we can probably expect to see these advances in future Terran and Vasudan warship designs."

3706, "We failed to stop the Hades before it could repair its engines, and the GTI superweapon successfully made the subspace jump to Altair.  It has only been a few short hours since the battle ended, but our worst fears have been confirmed.

We have already started to receive reports on the devastation being wrought in Altair and Aldebaran.  Hundreds of thousands of Vasudans are believed dead, and many of the PVN's highest-ranking officers have committed ritual suicide, including Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group.  Most alarmingly, Hammer of Light cells in Altair have begun to change their rhetoric, claiming that the prophesied Great Destroyers are not the Shivans after all, but the Terrans."

3707, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.  In our battle against the Hades, the odds were against us, and the sentiments of fourteen years are not easily pushed aside by the events of six months.  As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis.  In the face of overwhelming opposition from our former allies, Admiral Tess and the Soyakaze have surrendered."

3708, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.  In our battle against the Hades, the odds were against us, and the sentiments of fourteen years are not easily pushed aside by the events of six months.  As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis."

3709, "Our failure has brought calamity to our ravaged systems.  Though the wars against the Vasudans and the Shivans are now over, we may have paid the price with our souls."

3730, "Well done, pilots!  The GTI insurgency has been defeated!  Return to base for a hero's welcome."

3731, "My god, we've lost the Soyakaze!"

3732, "Pilots, you must destroy the Hades at all costs!  The GTI must be stopped here and now!"

3733, "Good work, pilots.  All the beam cannons facing the Soyakaze have been destroyed.  Continue your attack."

3734, "The Hades has deployed bombers!  We are launching Theta wing to intercept."

3735, "This is Admiral Amentep of the PVD Guardian.  Allied Terran vessels, please respond."

3736, "This is Admiral Tess of the GTD Soyakaze.  Greetings, Admiral.  I was not aware that the Guardian had been repaired yet."

3737, "Regrettably, it has not.  We are still in orbit around Cygnus Prime.  But let us dispense with protocol, for the time is short.  Am I correct in assuming that you have engaged the GTI destroyer Hades?"

3738, "Affirmative, Admiral.  Our bombers are attacking the Hades near Deneb III."

3739, "And so the circle completes itself.  Remarkable.  I wish to inform you, Admiral, that one of our fighter squadrons just repelled a Hammer of Light ambush against the GTC Orff and two bomber wings."

3740, "These craft had entered the Deneb system in an attempt to engage the Hades, but were apparently provided incorrect information by a traitor sympathetic to the GTI.  If you will transmit your coordinates, I will redeploy the Orff and its wings to your location."

3741, "Transmitting now.  Admiral Amentep, you have our sincerest gratitude."

3742, "The gratitude is ours, but you may repay us by recounting the story of your victory over the GTI.  Sa Terra, vessels of the GTA.  Admiral Amentep out."

3743, "GTC Orff now on station.  We are targeting the Hades."

3744, "Holy crap, the Orff is down!  It never even had a chance!"

3745, "The Orff will be avenged today, pilot, as will every other victim of the GTI.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3746, "It's good to see you again, Orff.  I really like your new friends."

3747, "Iota 1 here.  If you can keep those fighters off us, pilots, we'll take down that juggernaut faster than you can blink."

3748, "This is Pi 1.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3749, "Oh, hell... Command, the Hades is moving!"

3750, "The Hades appears to have channelled all of its remaining power into its main engines.  Pilots, you must either disable or destroy the Hades before it can escape.  Move it!"

3751, "The Hades is jumping out!"

3752, "Damn it, pilots! ... All right, we're attempting to track the Hades through subspace.  Return to base quickly and we might be able to redeploy you to its new location."

3753, "How are we ever going to kill this thing?  It's twice as big as an Orion and probably eight times as strong!"

3754, "Just keep fighting.  This is the same as every other assault mission you've been on, it's just going to take longer.  Stay focused.  The Hades isn't going anywhere."

3755, "We're lucky the Hope managed to hit the engine array.  The more strain we can put on this ship, the better.  I'm guessing those Terran-Shivan integrated systems aren't entirely stable."

3756, "I don't believe this.  We're actually winning!"

3757, "Don't let your guard down, kid.  The battle's not over yet."

3760, "The player runs the Gauntlet against an ever-increasing rush of Terrans.  Exciting, isn't it?"

3761, "While you were able to survive the first phase of Terran enemies, you were unable to meet the challenge presented to you by the other waves.  Your performance was what we would expect from a rookie fresh from flight school."

3762, "You were able to survive two phases of Terran enemies before you evacuated the Gauntlet.  This was a marginally satisfactory performance, one that we might expect from an Alliance reserve pilot."

3763, "You conquered three phases of Terran fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

3764, "You almost ran the entire Gauntlet, Pilot.  Excellent job.  Very few pilots could ever hope to emulate your accomplishment.  We are definitely going to keep our eye on you, Pilot.  You might want to consider meeting the final challenge of the Gauntlet sometime in the future.  Dismissed."

3765, "You successfully ran the Gauntlet, Pilot!  Congratulations!  Your skill will inspire confidence in your fellow pilots and in the Alliance.  Good job."

3766, "Vasudan Gauntlet"

3767, "The player runs the Gauntlet against an ever-increasing rush of Vasudans."

3768, "There will be 5 waves of Vasudan enemies.  Each wave will be comprised of 3 to 6 groups of enemy ships.  After clearing the final wave, you will have run the Gauntlet.  Doing so will win you a certain level of honor and privilege within the League of Defense.  Good luck, Pilot."

3769, "You conquered three phases of Vasudan fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

3770, "You successfully ran the Gauntlet, Pilot!  Congratulations!  Your performance was truly amazing.  To recognize your skill as a fighter pilot, the Alliance will send you into tremendously risky and dangerous battle situations.  Your courage inspires confidence in your fellow pilots and in the Alliance.  Again, a most excellent job, Pilot."

3771, "Your hull can't take much more, Pilot.  You may exit the Gauntlet without fear of losing honor, if you wish."

3772, "For your excellent record of confirmed kills, you have achieved the status of Ace."

3773, "For your outstanding record of confirmed kills, you have achieved the status of Double Ace."

3778, "For your excellent record of service, leadership, and conduct under fire, you have attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander."

3779, "Because your achievements distinguish you as an officer of the highest caliber, you have been promoted to the rank of Commander."

3780, "For your brilliance as a pilot, tactician, and leader, the Military Directorate confers upon you the rank of Captain."

3781, "Captain, your long and illustrious record distinguishes you as a leader of integrity, courage, and wisdom.  You are duly promoted to the rank of Commodore."

3782, "On behalf of the PVE Military Directorate and the Parliament of Vasuda, it is my honor to confer upon you the prestigious rank of Rear Admiral.  Congratulations."

3783, "Your career stands as a shining example of our ideals and values, and few officers have rendered greater service to the Empire.  On behalf of the PVE Military Directorate and the Parliament of Vasuda, I hereby confer upon you the prestigious rank of Vice Admiral."

3784, "Congratulations.  You have earned your place in the highest echelon of allied leadership.  Your character, courage, and genius are an inspiration to us all.  On behalf of the PVE Military Directorate and the Parliament of Vasuda, I hereby confer upon you the prestigious rank of Admiral.  Now go read a book."

3838, "You were also able to keep the area secured until we established a stronger foothold in the system.  Well done."

3839, "You were also unable to secure the area against future Shivan attacks.  It will be very difficult to retake this sector of space."

3840, "What we are most impressed with, however, is your protection of each and every ship.  We did not lose a single freighter or transport, and the Mecross is safe from Shivan bombers.

3849, "By protecting the Beta Aquilae Communications Terminal we are able to keep in contact with our forces in the outer systems.  Losing the communication terminal would have been a severe blow.  Well done pilot.

For continued service to the Alliance, we are awarding you the Good Conduct Medal.  Keep it up."

3850, "We lost many escape pods in the battle as well.  Such a loss of life is difficult to bear.  Several key scientists were unable to evacuate the installation.  They, and their research, will be sorely missed."
