They combine solar arrays with fusion reactors to keep the ships engines and systems operating for longs periods of time.  An advanced internal computer system can totally automate all components of the ship.  The GTE Vidar class was constructed shortly after the GTVA was formed by former GTI operatives operating in the Mirfak system.  The Vidar combines all the features of a standard explorer class ship with a few modifications.  Armament consists of AAA, flak, and laser turrets and the ship is more than capable of defending itself from a light Shivan attack."

This is Admiral Richard Cole, commanding officer of the GTD Warlock, flagship of the 7th fleet.  For all you replacement pilots coming aboard, a warm welcome.

You join some of the best people in the Galactic Terran Vasudan Alliance in our crew of 10,000.  With over 120 fightercraft, the Warlock houses a total of four squadrons."

4915, "The Shivan Situation

It's been over four years since the Shivans destroyed the Capella star.  Our Great War nemesis, thought to be contained in the Gamma Draconis system, was not.  Shivan forces have been pouring into Allied systems over the last 48 hours.  We've lost the GTD Reno, the GVC Qu-eth, and the GTC Calhoun.  Command estimates losses in excess of 100,000 lives."

4916, "Allied Objectives

Allied Command has ordered the GTD Warlock and the 7th fleet to the Regulus system.  The Shivans have been executing a sustained, all out co-ordinated attack against Terran and Vasudan ships and installations.

Intelligence suspects that the Shivans are entering the Regulus system from an unknown jump node.  Both the Polaris and Sirius nodes are under close observation.  One of our objectives is to find the Shivans' point of entry."

4917, "The State of the Alliance

The Alliance, despite numerous crackdowns on pirate activity, remains unstable.  In the four years since the Second Shivan Incursion, our Alliance has been barely holding together.

We lost the majority of our fleet in Capella and have been struggling to rebuild ever since.  It is imperative that we evacuate as many civilians and military personnel as we can as quickly as possible.  We may not be able to withstand another Shivan assault."

4918, "The State of the Alliance (Continued)

The Sol Knossos project is well underway as every contractor in the Alliance contributes to its construction.  With this new threat in Regulus, Command has ordered that the activation of the Sol Knossos be suspended until the situation can be resolved.

If we fail to stop the Shivan advance, we can only hope that humanity can be safe in the Sol System."

4919, "The 332nd Black Mantas

All new pilots aboard the Warlock are being assigned to the 332nd Black Mantas.  Your squadron leader, Lt. Taine, will brief you as to your mission objectives.

All squadron leaders must attend a Quarterdeck meeting at 0930.  All squadrons are slated for duty as of 1100 hours tomorrow morning after the Warlock makes the jump to Regulus."

4921, "At 1535, the GTD Warlock received a distress call from the general vicinity of the Polaris jump node.  The ship identifies itself as the GTSC Disen.  It's a science cruiser, Faustus class.  Everything checks out in our records but its mission objectives are rather sketchy.  Command has ordered a wing to check the ship out."

4929, "Good work, pilot.  I'm impressed with your abilities.

The Disen's computer database revealed little information.  What data there was has been classified on a need-to-know basis, which does suggest that whatever it was, is important.

The Shivan presence is growing in this sector.  You and your wing are a credit to the Alliance."

4930, "Command has issued no official or unofficial explanation for the GTCv Odin and it's orders.  Commodore Russik appeared to be operating under mysterious orders from someone at High Command, but that investigation and its details are way beyond my security clearance - and yours."

4931, "Command has issued no explanation for the Commodore's highly suspicious actions.  "

4932, "You have been declared AWOL, pilot!  Jumping out before you are ordered to do so is grounds for immediate imprisonment."

I thought you were ready for this outfit.  Maybe I was wrong.  Perhaps you should go spend some more time in the training simulators.

Dismissed."

Allied forces have now taken position orbiting the planet and have repelled several initial attack waves.  The Shivan destroyer Revial continues to bombard the planet.

This mission was a lot more intense than expected and you and your wingmen performed admirably.  Well done."

The crew of the Warlock is to be commended on their excellent operations in Sirius.  Many of you have already received commendations from Fleet Headquarters and I personally have recommended many others.

You have all served the Alliance well, but we must remain vigilant.  There are still two major strongholds of Shivan influence in the Sirius system and it is our duty to root them out."

With the death toll at over 100,000 on Sirius III alone, the Alliance has suffered a deadly blow and Command has been requisitioning many medical transports to help improve the situation on the bombarded planet.

Several scout wings have been dispatched to the Regulus system.  They report that the Shivan advance has been halted and that many Shivan transports are retreating back into the Knossos portal that suddenly appeared in that system only a week ago.

This is a grim day, pilots."

5471, "Beyond the Portal

We have entered the Mintaka system beyond the Regulus Knossos portal.  What we have encountered is very much like what the 3rd fleet found beyond the original Knossos portal.

The Mintaka system is made up of no less than five stars. Terran scientists were puzzled when one of these stars went supernova 700 years ago, long before than it was expected to perish. Only its core remains intact. The rest of the star became a massive nebula."

5472, "Resemblance to Capella

If we were to return to Capella the view outside would be very much the same.  Perhaps this nebula is the result of the destruction of yet another sun by the Shivan Sathanas fleet hundreds of years ago.

We are to keep on our guard.  Should a Sathanas juggernaut be sighted we have orders to destroy the portal and return to GTVA space."

5473, "The Fleet

Command has authorized the deployment of the 7th Fleet and the 12th Vasudan Battlegroup into the Mintaka nebula system.  Our objective is to remove Shivan influence and penetrate as deep into Shivan lines as possible."

5474, "Shivan Influence

Special Operations Command will be involved in an operation to determine what happened in the Sirius and Regulus systems.

Shivan forces have been retreating from most engagements, although we still face stiff resistance.

Intelligence agents are going to be conducting high priority missions to learn as much as we can about the Shivans and this is the best opportunity we've yet had.  Do not disrupt any intelligence gathering operation."

5475, "Lt. Stavros here.  Thanks to the excellent work of the Lonestars, we have now moved the Warlock into the region beyond the portal.  Similar to the system beyond the Gamma Draconis portal, this region is a nebula that is several lightyears in size."

5476, "Because our sensors are limited, we have deployed several wings from the Warlock and Tatenen to scout ahead and give us accurate information on the capabilities and numbers of the Shivans.  EM interference is not high and we expect that all internal systems will be operating at normal levels."

5481, "Good work defending the Hawkeye.  Because of your efforts, the ship will now be available for intelligence operations within the nebula."

5482, "Although the existence of Sathanas debris, compounded by the discovery of further debris, is cause for concern, Allied Command has elected not to pull out of the nebula.

The reasoning behind this decision is unknown, although it appears that somebody at very high levels wants this exploration to continue despite the risks.

Further information on the debris has been classified way beyond my level of clearance."

5483, "You have been declared AWOL, pilot!  Jumping out before you are ordered to do so is grounds for immediate imprisonment.

You've failed your objective to patrol the area ahead of the Warlock.  Another scouting party will now be required to accomplish the same tasks.  We're wasting manpower and possibly even lives cleaning up after you, pilot."

5484, "Failure to protect the AWACS has cost us dearly.  I don't suspect that Command will find it worthwhile for you to be flying with us again.  I hear that SOC aren't happy that the Hawkeye was lost, either.  They had planned to use the vessel in some classified operations within the nebula."

A warm welcome and return to our pilots who successfully completed the officer exchange program.

The Tatenen is now returning to Terran-Vasudan space for repairs and refit."

5873, "Traitors

Admiral Russik has been deemed a traitor to the Alliance.  He wilfully fired upon GTVA craft, refused to turn over GTVA property, and may have been conspiring against the Alliance for the last 20 years.

The rest of this briefing will give all 7th Fleet personnel information previously classified which shows the true peril of the situation."

5874, "Points of Origin

The Vidar Project was the first project that the then Lieutenant Russik worked on.  It was a top secret operation being conducted by the rogue Galactic Terran Intelligence agency back in the era of the GTA.  The objective was to meld Terran and Shivan physiology into a hybrid lifeform.  The hybrids would then be used in conjunction with experimental Shivan communications technology.  We suspect several may have actually been created."

5875, "The GTE Vidar

The GTE Vidar was the only ship of its class produced.  It was designed using the hull of a Terran Explorer class ship, a very rare vessel.  The design itself is old, but we can deduce that the ship has been refitted after the defeat of the GTI.

Its exact communications capabilities are unknown.  However, it is believed that Admiral Russik integrated an ETAK device into Terran-Shivan genetic hybrids on the ship, potentially giving it an unparalleled ability to communicate with the Shivans."

5876, "Objectives

Our mission is clear.  We must hunt down Admiral Russik and capture or destroy the Vidar before it can be used.  The potential for such a technology is terrifying.

We have blockaded both jump nodes in the Kaus Borealis system and our intelligence personnel are attempting to deduce the Admiral's position.

We must accomplish our objective or we will be forced to shut down the Knossos portal in Regulus and abandon these systems.  We cannot afford the risk of allowing another rogue Admiral to collaborate with the Shivans at our doorstep."

5877, "636th Wolfpack Squadron

Due to your exemplary record and your time aboard the GVD Tatenen, Command has decided that you be promoted as the squadron commander for the elite 636th Wolfpack squadron.

You will receive all your briefings from the quarterdeck.  Because of your elite status, you will be called upon to perform the more hazardous and sensitive missions and you will have access to the most advanced technology available aboard the Warlock."

5880, "A Leviathan class cruiser, the Castigar, is the front runner for Russik's small taskforce.  The 636th will intercept the Castigar and disable its communications and engine subsystems.  Try to do as little damage as possible - Stiletto II missiles or Disruptors are recommended."

5881, "Castigar"

5882, "It is imperative that the Castigar is not destroyed.  We'd like to minimize casualties and capture Russik and his conspirators alive.  If the communications and engines are not brought down in under 3 minutes, the Castigar will be in a position to warn the Kirosi of our ambush."

5883, "Once the Kirosi and the Vidar have entered the area we will deploy the GTD Warlock to resolve the situation.  We are looking for Admiral Russik to stand down and surrender - but be prepared if the situation dictates more extreme actions.  Zeta wing's Boanerges bombers will be deployed if necessary.  You're flying this mission because you're resourceful and talented.  Do what you have to do, pilots."

5884, "Good work disabling the communication and engine systems on the Castigar.  Reports are that your team pulled off that part of the operation with exceptional skill."

5885, "The ambush went well.  The Kirosi has been destroyed and the rest of Russik's fleet has been hunted down in other parts of the system and either captured or destroyed.

Unfortunately, the Vidar and Admiral Russik slipped through our fingers and have escaped to the Gienah Cygni jump node.  We will be pursuing them into that system shortly."

5886, "You failed to eliminate the engines and communications system on the Castigar in time.  Admiral Russik learned of the ambush and avoided the situation.  This is a totally unacceptable outcome from any GTVA unit.  The fact that your elite unit performed below par creates doubts about you and your squadron's capabilities.  You are being demoted and removed from active flight status."

6020, "Well done, Alpha and Beta.  You've won a major victory.  Return to the Warlock."

6023, "A small Shivan taskforce has evaded the Warlock and is attempting to outflank us by jumping to the Kaus Borealis system."

6029, "We have surrounded the node with Mjolnir RBC sentry guns, but those sentries are going to need support if we are to prevent the Shivans from destroying our reinforcements.  You will lead the bomber strike against the various Shivan capital ships and supply transports.  In order for this operation to be a success, all of the Shivan ships must be destroyed."

6036, "All Shivan capital ships were destroyed and our reinforcements arrived.  They will now head further into the Naos system with considerably less Shivan resistance.  Once again, you and your squadron have proven their elite status, despite the overwhelming odds aligned against you."

6037, "You failed to eliminate all of the Shivan ships attacking the Kaus Borealis jump node.  Our reinforcements were attacked and sustained heavy damage.  Now we cannot begin our attack on the Naos system until GTVA Command assigns us further assets.  Admiral Russik may have just slipped through our hands."

6070, "The Ravana has been designated Nox.  All ships concentrate your firepower on that destroyer.  We must take it down!"

6071, "The Nox has gone critical!  Destruction imminent."

6072, "Nox registering critical hull failure!  Scratch another Shivan destroyer!"

6073, "Command, this is the GTCv Coventry.  We have arrived in the Gienah Cygni system."

6074, "Affirmative, Coventry.  Standby for deployment."

6075, "Mission accomplished, pilots!  You have clearance to return to base."

6076, "Mission is a failure!  Abort mission!"

6079, "Final Duel"

6080, "Destroy the comm nexus before Russik can use it."

6081, "Pieces of the Puzzle

After hours of intelligence work aboard the GTE Vidar, we have finally uncovered Russik's plan.

Russik believes that a single Terran-Shivan hybrid holds the power to control Shivan ships.  This theory is based on the idea that Shivans are controlled by a hive mind."

6082, "Russik's Plan

Russik not only contacted the Shivans, but he gained control of a small number of their forces using the hybrids in his possession.  Intelligence  believes that a central communications nexus in the Naos system may hold the key to his power over the Shivans.  With Shivan forces under his control, he could take control of the GTVA in a mere matter of months."

6083, "The Final Attack

Our objectives are simple, if difficult.  We must prevent a takeover of the GTVA by eliminating Admiral Russik and preventing the Shivans from attacking our space.  If this means destroying him and every Shivan in Naos, so be it.

All squadrons are to report to the briefing room in 10 minutes."

6084, "This is Admiral Cole.

We've discovered Admiral Russik's location.  His transport is in close proximity to the SD Daskha, a Ravana class destroyer.  Sensor scans indicate that the destroyer is emitting a high frequency subspace pulse.  The purpose of the pulse is unknown but we suspect it is connected to Admiral Russik's control of the Shivans and broader plan."

6085, "Daskha"

6086, "We have no time to spare.  We will launch an all-out attack against Admiral Russik and any Shivans that get in our way.  Remember, we want Russik alive if possible, so consider his shuttle non-combatant.  I will personally lead the Warlock into a direct confrontation with the Daskha.  The Warlock will be doing this the old-fashioned way."

6087, "Wolfpack Squadron, you will lead the way.  Eliminate all Shivan fighters, bombers, and assist the Warlock by making surgical strikes against the hostile destroyer.  Eliminate beam cannons and maneuvering subsystems."

6088, "Gamma"

6089, "Once Shivan forces have been eliminated, we will confront Admiral Russik.  Justice is served in the courts, not in front of a firing squad.  We will bring him in alive and make him pay for his crimes against the Alliance.  We'll be with you every step of the way, pilots.  Good luck!  If we can stop the Admiral here, we can preserve the safety and security of our home systems."

6090, "Gemini 1 - Admiral Russik"

6091, "The Shivan destroyer Daskha was destroyed along with most of Admiral Russik's hope of victory in this engagement.  Well done.  Without your heroic actions disabling the cannons while under heavy fighter attack, the Warlock would not have won the day.  You are to be commended for your skill and dedication."

6092, "Admiral Russik committed suicide by self-destructing his transport.  He can no longer be brought to justice and we may never learn how far his conspiracy into the GTVA extends.  For now, we can rest a little easier knowing the fact that his plan to control the Shivans failed and that we have secured the GTVA from the threat of Shivan invasion once again.  It's finally over - for now."

6093, "The Warlock survived the engagement and is returning to the Sirius system for repairs.  I personally thank you and your squadron for defending my ship from intense enemy attack.  Well done!"

6094, "We've failed in our mission to stop Admiral Russik and save the GTVA from certain attack.  We are returning to Regulus, but our sensors are already detecting a massive Shivan buildup."

6095, "Destroy the Ravana destroyer by eliminating its forward beam cannons."

6096, "The GTD Warlock was destroyed and all 10,000 on board the vessel were lost.  The is a dark day indeed for the Alliance.  You are dismissed."

6097, "Watch for the Seraphim bombers that attack the Warlock, and disable the Daskha's beam cannons.  Ensure you dispatch the comm node quickly, and assist in the destruction of the cruisers."

6148, "All units, secure the area, then return to the Warlock's fighterbay.  Well done, people."

6149, "Russik may be trying to call in more Shivans, but we have very little information about that device or its capabilities.  Destroy the Ravana - then we'll deal with the node."
