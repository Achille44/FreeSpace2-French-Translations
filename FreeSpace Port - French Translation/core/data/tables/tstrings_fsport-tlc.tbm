  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.
  The device first finds the nearest GTA communications beacon in the system. It then sends its coordinates to that station through a contained subspace portal.  All of the equipment is contained in a sensor-shielded container to prevent detection.  The SHB is simply a long-range homing device."

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.

Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

5509, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

The ruthless mercs lured a boarding party under the flag of surrender and then murdered them by self-destructing their own ship.

The vengeful message which implicated the suicide was actually transmitted from an unknown craft in the battle area!"

Further, the E.L.F radio wave sent from Lockheed during the Timberland operation was apparently a trigger which detonated the bomb on board the Timberland.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to keep those mercs quiet about their employer.  We believe this someone to be Admiral Darcy.

Under any other circumstances, I would have ordered this craft captured.  However, we don't have that luxury right now."

5669, "Although we didn't have much time to hail the Alexander Bell, it appears that our message was going through.  Unfortunately, the communications outpost was not responding.  Since we are so far away from our home system, we will need to relay our message off of the Alexander Bell."

6196, "A group of Vasudian scientists has been secretly working on a new Capital Class warhead.  Your wing will disable the Crusier housing these warhead prototypes and will cover the demolition team as they destroy the Cruiser."

6197, "Good afternoon pilots.  Before I begin, know that the following briefing is classified and may not be discussed freely outside of this room.  A group of Vasudans are violating the Treaty of Shiva by developing weapons without GTA knowledge or approval."

6198, "A group of Vasudan scientists have recently been developing a Capital Class warhead.  They have been secretly working on this project aboard a Cruiser which we have named the Manhattan.  GTA Command has ordered us to take the Manhattan down...discretely."

6199, "Manhattan"

6200, "Because high tension still exists between our species, we must make the Manhattan's destruction look like an accident.  Consequently, your wing must quickly dispatch the Cruiser's complement of fighters and await the arrival of a demolitions unit which will place a special charge on the Manhattan's hull."

6201, "Orion 3"

6202, "Demolition Unit"

6203, "It goes without saying that you will need to disarm and disable the Manhattan so that the demolitions team may work unhindered.  It will only take a moment for the team to place the charge.  The resulting explosion will make it seem as though the Manhattan was destroyed by a warhead prototype rupture rather than a Terran attack."

6204, "After the Manhattan is destroyed, see if you can find and scan any salvage.  Unfortunately, the prototypes were too unstable to attempt a capture operation, but we would like to know what the scientists were working on."

6206, "Manhattan Cargo"

6207, "Another note worthy of mention, the Manhattan has positioned itself very close to the Beta Cygni jump node and will undoubtedly make a run for it if threatened.  Make sure that the Manhattan doesn't escape.  As always, do your best to keep your team intact.  Good luck."

6208, "Alpha, you were successful in taking out the entire complement of Manhattan's fighters.  Good job."

6209, "You succeeded in knocking out the Manhattan's subsystems and clearing the way for demolitions...nicely done."

6210, "The operation went smoothly.  The demolitions team was able to plant their special charge.  Long range scans show a perfect internal explosion.  Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.  GTA command believes that the removal of the cargo was undetected."

6211, "Extra congratulations to you for bringing your team back in one piece."

6212, "You failed to destroy all of the Manhattan's fighters.  This is pathetic work Alpha 1."

6213, "Unfortunately, you weren't able to perform a scan of the Manhattan cargo.  Fortunately, it was only schematics...however, had the freighter entered subspace with an unstable warhead...many lives would have been lost."

6214, "After the Manhattan blows, scan the area for cargo.  Once you find it, close to 150 meters and scan quickly."

6215, "Sadly, alpha wing is smaller upon return.  As the possibility of war with the Vasudans grows stronger, it becomes even more imperative to protect your wingmen."

6216, "Keep an eye on damaged wingmen and send them home if necessary.  Also, make sure to keep your wing far away from the Cruiser blast."

6217, "Ultimately, this mission is a huge failure.  The Manhattan was allowed to escape and the Vasudan scientists will be able to finish their research.  Don't be surprised if we see new Cap-ship killers in our next engagement with the Vasudans."

6218, "As soon as you have the opportunity, disable the Manhattan by taking out its engine subsystem."

6219, "You were unsuccessful in protecting the survey freighter.  We lost a talented crew and vital information."

6248, "With the Shivans controlling this system, GTA forces are almost non-existant, however, we've located a loosely-guarded GTA supply depot with cargo that will help repair the $f GTC $f Weaver. We need this cargo to repair our communication systems, without it, it will be a long time before we can escape this system."

6253, "$f Alpha will fly in alone approximately ten kilometers from the cargo. As Arjuna can easily call in reinforcements if necessary, Alpha's primary objective will be to provide a distraction for $h Arjuna. It is unlikely the Shivans will consider a lone fighter much of a threat, and hopefully won't call in reinforcements."

6254, "$f Alpha's orders are to engage $h Arjuna and then lead them away from the supply depot."

6257, "Once $f Alpha has successfully led Arjuna astray, $f Omega wing will arrive to remove three of the cargo containers. $f Omega will be escorted by $f Epsilon wing. It is imperative that $f Omega wing is successful in its mission."

6258, "If any hostiles get too close to the supply depot, it is likely they will call in reinforcements. It is unlikely $f Omega would survive an all out attack by Shivan forces. You must keep $h Arjuna away from the cargo until $f Omega has left the area."

6259, "None of the Omega transports made it back to base. The Shivan reinforcements were too much for us. We're going to have to hope we can find another way to repair the GTC Weaver's communication systems."

6260, "Don't let any hostiles approach Omega once you've lead them away. While Arjuna wing does not pose a threat to the transports, the reinforcements it can call in will."

6261, "Omega was able to escape the area despite the appearance of Shivan reinforcements. Good work, pilot."

6262, "You did a fine job protecting the Omega transports, despite the fact not all the freighters escaped. While we could have used those extra supplies, what we escaped with will simply have to do."

6263, "Congradulations! Omega successfully retrieved the cargo and escaped the area undetected. The supplies in those cargo containers will allow the GTC Weaver to repair its communications systesm, and bring us one step closer to escaping enemy territory."

6264, "You were unable to draw Arjuna away from the supply depot. Omega cannot risk being detected, and thus could not approach the supply depot with Arjuna's presence."

6265, "Arjuna will likely follow you anywhere you fly once they catch sight of you."

6266, "You did a fine job distracting Arjuna from their duty. Destroying the wing and keeping them far away from the supply depot allowed Omega to complete their mission without any problems."
