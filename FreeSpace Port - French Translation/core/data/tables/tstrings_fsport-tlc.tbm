  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.

Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5529, "If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.

5530, "Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

5537, "Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5538, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5539, "The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

The Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency concluded their investigation regarding recent rebel activities.  As suspected, the TDIA tracked the transfer of billions of credits from the HARC organization to the accounts of GTA pilots who have recently gone AWOL.  Brian Giordino, president of HARC was taken into custody early this morning and has been charged with high treason.  Giordino continues to proclaim his innocence and accuses the TDIA of setting him up."

The Vasudan ambassador has alerted us that the Vasudan Empire has chosen a new homeworld, Mandala Prime in the Manda system.  This news is troubling to the GTA because Mandala Prime was their greatest hope for successful colonization in the outer rim.  Of the hundreds of charted worlds, none is as environmentally similar to Earth as Mandala Prime and is obviously better suited for Terrans.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has already begun negotiations."

5610, "Good evening pilots.  As you all know, the Mercenary force has a Leviathan Class Cruiser (The Timberland) trapped in the Manda system.  The Nepenthe has been tracking it and it appears to making a run for the Betelgeuse jump node."

It is for diplomatic reasons only that we are performing this unconventional capture operation.  But please remember, this IS a capture operation.  Do not destroy the Timberland unless it is absolutely necessary."

5622, "The events which occurred today were both unexpected and beyond our control.  Although we were successful in forcing the Timberland into submission, we ultimately  lost the craft due to an apparent self-destruct.  The pilots we have debriefed have all reported hearing conflicting transmissions from the cruiser.  GTA Command only received one transmission which implicated the suicide."

5623, "Unfortunately, this mission is a failure.  Though the Timberland put up a good fight, she was ready to quit when the GTD Nepenthe jumped in.  We lost a fine ship today, but worse, we lost the ability to interrogate the Terran rebels."

6226, "Good afternoon pilots.  Before I begin, know that the following briefing is classified and may not be discussed freely outside of this room.  A group of Vasudans are violating the Treaty of Shiva by developing weapons without GTA knowledge or approval."

6227, "A group of Vasudan scientists have recently been developing a Capital Class warhead.  They have been secretly working on this project aboard a Cruiser which we have named the Manhattan.  GTA Command has ordered us to take the Manhattan down...discretely."

6228, "Manhattan"

6229, "Because high tension still exists between our species, we must make the Manhattan's destruction look like an accident.  Consequently, your wing must quickly dispatch the Cruiser's complement of fighters and await the arrival of a demolitions unit which will place a special charge on the Manhattan's hull."

6230, "Orion 3"

6232, "It goes without saying that you will need to disarm and disable the Manhattan so that the demolitions team may work unhindered.  It will only take a moment for the team to place the charge.  The resulting explosion will make it seem as though the Manhattan was destroyed by a warhead prototype rupture rather than a Terran attack."

6238, "You succeeded in knocking out the Manhattan's subsystems and clearing the way for demolitions...nicely done."

6239, "The operation went smoothly.  The demolitions team was able to plant their special charge.  Long range scans show a perfect internal explosion.  Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.  GTA command believes that the removal of the cargo was undetected."

6240, "Extra congratulations to you for bringing your team back in one piece."

6241, "You failed to destroy all of the Manhattan's fighters.  This is pathetic work Alpha 1."

6242, "Unfortunately, you weren't able to perform a scan of the Manhattan cargo.  Fortunately, it was only schematics...however, had the freighter entered subspace with an unstable warhead...many lives would have been lost."

6243, "After the Manhattan blows, scan the area for cargo.  Once you find it, close to 150 meters and scan quickly."

6244, "Sadly, alpha wing is smaller upon return.  As the possibility of war with the Vasudans grows stronger, it becomes even more imperative to protect your wingmen."

6245, "Keep an eye on damaged wingmen and send them home if necessary.  Also, make sure to keep your wing far away from the Cruiser blast."

6291, "You did a fine job protecting the Omega transports, despite the fact not all the freighters escaped. While we could have used those extra supplies, what we escaped with will simply have to do."

6292, "Congradulations! Omega successfully retrieved the cargo and escaped the area undetected. The supplies in those cargo containers will allow the GTC Weaver to repair its communications systesm, and bring us one step closer to escaping enemy territory."

6293, "You were unable to draw Arjuna away from the supply depot. Omega cannot risk being detected, and thus could not approach the supply depot with Arjuna's presence."

6294, "Arjuna will likely follow you anywhere you fly once they catch sight of you."

6295, "You did a fine job distracting Arjuna from their duty. Destroying the wing and keeping them far away from the supply depot allowed Omega to complete their mission without any problems."

Luckily, the $f Barnett was carrying information which will help prevent this weapon from affecting us again. Good job, pilot!"

6511, "You have destroyed the unknown ship.  By doing so you have denied the Shivans the use of this weapon and bought us time to analyze the information on the $f Barnett."
