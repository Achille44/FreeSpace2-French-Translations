$b Operation $b Templar

Congratulations, pilot.  Because of your excellent service record, you have been chosen to participate in Operation Templar.  This is a joint Terran-Vasudan endeavor intended to eradicate the last remnants of the Vasudan fanatics who call themselves the Hammer of Light."

4429, "(fr)$b New $b Technologies

Since losing contact with Earth, availability of the Avenger and Prometheus cannons has been extremely limited.  A Terran-Vasudan research group has developed a retrofit of the Prometheus using synthetic gases, sacrificing damage output.

The Prometheus R is being issued to all Alliance pilots as standard-issue weaponry."

4430, "(fr)$b New $b Technologies

You are also issued the Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun.  It is highly effective against shielding and subsystems.

The Akheton is designed to function with Vasudan power grids.  You may need to allocate more energy to your weapons systems to fight effectively."

4431, "(fr)$b New $b Technologies

Finally, the Serkr anti-capital ship torpedo has been put into mass production.  Developed by the GTI during the Hades Rebellion, the highly modular design is the most powerful warhead in our arsenal.

Older weapons reserves are limited, so choose your loadouts carefully."

4432, "(fr)At 2130 hours, $h Hammer $h of $h Light operatives infiltrated Vasudan ranks in an attempt to hijack the $f GVD $f Anhur, a Typhon-class destroyer in the Vasuda system.  Security forces are now battling the rebels for control of the ship.  Your mission is to provide cover for the marine transports that will dock with the $f Anhur and insert reinforcements."

4442, "(fr)You prevented the Hammer of Light from escaping with the captured destroyer.  They will be that much weaker when we meet them again.  But that provides little comfort to those lost on the Anhur.  We must somehow eliminate this scourge once and for all!"

4443, "(fr)You did not have orders to return to base.  By deserting your unit, you have jeopardized this mission.  Consider yourself grounded until you can be court-martialed, pilot."

4636, "(fr)$b January $b 13, $b 2339

Welcome to $y Altair, pilots. Our joint efforts with the $b Parlimentary $b Vasudan $b Navy have gone very well. We've taken control of the $y Aldebaran node and we've fortified several staging points throughout the system. We'll begin the assault on the $r Sahr $r Shipyards in just a few days. For the rest of our time here, $b Vasudan $b Admiral $b Khu will have direct operational control. Under his orders we will unseat the $r Hammer $r of $r Light stronghold and cut off their supply chain all at once. Admiral?"

4637, "(fr)Thank you, $b Commander. The $b GTD $b Intrepid has been an important part of this operation. Our success can be measured by the strength of our alliance.

Pilots. The shipyards once owned and operated by $b Sahr $b Corporation have become much more than a manufacturing facility. Since the $r Hammer $r of $r Light took control, they have not only increased production to supply their fleet, but they have also turned the facility into beacon of their fanaticism. $r Sahr has become one of the most heavily fortified outposts in explored space.

The outpost now features several fortifications that deter direct assault including long-range torpedo platforms, a cloud of mines, and several fortified installations. In addition, $r Sahr is home to enough of the $r Hammer fleet to withstand even a modest assault on it's own. If we're going to take $r Sahr, we cannot rely on brute strength. We must be clever."

4638, "(fr)We have devised a two-part strategy that will end in a direct assault on the shipyards. First we cut off system-wide support and then we assault the shipyards directly. Your squad leaders will fill you in on your roles.

A victory at $r Sahr will be the biggest victory against the $r Hammer $r of $r Light since their inception. The Terran government and the Emperor have put their full support toward this operation, but the burden of success rests on your shoulders, pilots.

Report to your mission briefings at once."

4639, "(fr)Alright pilots. For those of you that are new, I'm $b Lieutenant $b Maria. Welcome to the $B 47th. The opportunity we've been waiting for has arrived. We've been assigned to destroy a staging area located out in the gamma quad of the system. This is one of multiple locations that the allied fleet will target simultaneously. Our primary object is complete destruction of all hostile targets."

4640, "(fr)HoL Fleet Staging"

4641, "(fr)Sahr Shipyards"

4642, "(fr)We've detected several wings of fighters, a sortie of $r Newet $r class $r cruisers, and at least one newer design out of Sahr, the $r Selket of which we have no data on it's capabilities. Be cautious.

Once you engage the Newets, the $g GTC $g Bunker $g Hill will lock on to your coordinates for a close proximity jump into the area, minimizing the damage it takes before it can engage the hostile fleet. The Bunker will serve to try and distract the Newet gunners while you bring your weapons to bear. However, if she takes too much damage, she'll be forced to retreat. You'll need to work quickly. Newets are thin as paper, but bite like a damn shark."

4649, "(fr)By the end of today, we'll have destroyed every known depot and staging zone we could find. Sahr is going to be well aware of what's coming. However, we will do anything we can to slow down that realization. To that end, we're sending in a localized comm jammer. It will halt long-range hostile comm traffic and prevent word of our attack reaching Sahr until it's too late."

4650, "(fr)The premise is simple. Warp in, destroy all hostile targets, warp home. However, as $b Admiral $b Po discovered a few years go, the $r HoL has proven to be far more cunning than anticipated. We know they are working towards a specific goal that has gone far beyond fanaticism but the eggheads upstairs haven't figured out what that is just yet. Chances are high that the Hammer has a contingency, so let's show them what it means to be a $B Cutthroat.

Check your loadout and be on deck in 30 minutes, pilots. Good luck."

4651, "(fr)Excellent job, pilots, making swift work of your assignment. You swept the area of hostile fighters quickly and paved the way for the $g Bunker $g Hill short-jump in range without getting slaughtered. While the cruiser took on the Newet's guns, your team was able to quickly destroy each hostile ship."

4653, "(fr)In addition, you were able to reinforce the $g Scepter's position. This quick action salvaged that particular operation and will make our assault on Sahr a little easier.

However, the day is not over yet. The second phase of this operation is about to begin. The fleet is moving in to position and your skills will be required. Your commander is gathering the last data on this phase of the operation and planning out your moves for the next. This day will mark the end of the $r Hammer $r of $r Light's control in $y Altair. Briefings are in two hours."

4654, "(fr)Pilot, you abandoned your mission and left your squad. This was an unfortunate decision on your part. The MPs are taking you into custody. You will be dealt with after the final assault."

4706, "(fr)Pilots, I need you to focus. Gamma and Delta have requested reinforcements and you're available. The coordinates should be coming through now. A cleanup crew is being sortied to grab the supplies and ejected pilots."

4719, "(fr)We don't have much time. Listen up. The first part of our operation did not go completely as planned. Only about half of the attacks were completely successful. Many of the rest were forced to retreat. There are still three operations we have not heard back from.$b Admiral $b Khu has informed me that $W Parliment $W Leader $W Amasis has ordered us to procceed to the final assault anyway, so we're going in."

4720, "(fr)HoL Staging"

4721, "(fr)Scouts report that $r Sahr has powered up their defenses and even rearranged the mine field. There never was a chance that we'd have the element of surprise, but I had hoped they'd be less prepared.

The biggest problem is the mine field. It has been arranged into a sort of shell with it's open end towards the planet. Because of this, we can't exit subspace within range. We're going to have to go around. Ourselves and the $g Nereid will take one side while the $g PVD $g Hedetet and the $g PVD $g Imhotep will take the other. The rest of the fleet has been ordered back to the Aldebaran node to form a blockade."

In order to prevent that, we're going to keep all pilots grounded until we reach the point of engagement. Once there, the torpedo turrets will be brought to bear. $r{ Sahr's $} main platform, the $r HLI $r Akhenaten, is equipped with long-range version of the Aratrum torpedo and we expect $r Sahr is already powering up their docked destroyers as well. The nearest destroyer will be the $r HLD $r Vigil. Beta wing, this is your priority. You need to quickly destroy it's torpedo turrets."

Alpha, you will stay with them the entire time. At that point, Gamma will be launched with fresh bombers. Their job is to hunt down the nearest cruisers and take them down. Alpha will fly fighter screen for Gamma as well."

4734, "(fr)The Vasudans willl be performing similar attack runs. Given that this is a highly volatile situation, expect to follow new orders as the battle progresses. We will continue the assault until the entire shipyard is brought down or the $r Hammer $r of $r Light surrenders. We will bring these terrorists to their knees so that we can finally begin to rebuild our society in a true peacetime. This would be the first real peace in almost twenty years.

We were entirely unprepared for the level of defense that the $r Hammer $r of $r Light showed. $b GTA $b Command was following $b{ Admiral Khu's $} leadership. This was his plan and some of us feel his pride clouded his judgement. We have filed complaints through official channels with $b Parliament, but there is nothing more we can do but mourn our dead.

The $r HoL leadership has taken most of the ejected pilots prisoner with a handful being offered for prisoner exchanges.

For those pilots of the $W Cutthroats previously stationed on the $g Intrepid, welcome aboard the $g Nereid. My name is $W Captain $W Varner. I wish it were under better circumstances and I offer condolences on the loss of your friends aboard the Intrepid. Unfortunately, your stay here will be short. We barely have the resources to accomodate our own squadrons, so you'll be dropped off in $y Delta $y Serpentis for reassignment.

; ships.tbl

5384, "(fr)The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Triton Dynamics designed the Hygeia class with huge cargo bays for munitions storage, plus the latest magnetic-stasis delivery system for quickly re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

5385, "(fr)When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae and gas giants. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

5386, "(fr)The Maiman is a unique class of starship designed by Luyten New Alliance engineers. Upon long-term examination of data acquired from the Hades wreckage on the surface of Deneb, LNA engineers were able to understand the basic concepts of how beam weaponry worked. The Maiman is a cutter-class ship - larger than a gunship such as the Prominence, but smaller and less well armed than a true cruiser like the Fenris or Leviathan. The Maiman's prototype photon beam cannon functions on similar, albeit different, properties than the flux cannons found on the Hades and the Lucifer, but, for a prototype weapon, it is capable of inflicting serious damage on enemy warships of cruiser size and below. Two Maimans have been created with more on the way, and the LNA prefers to keep them in reserve, allowing their beam cannons to be regularly updated as Luyten engineers further refine the design."

The PNV took these harsh lessons to heart and developed the Cairo from the outset to be able to hold its own against even heavy attack. The Cairo could be considered roughly equivalent to the Terran Arcadia, but possesses far superior armament. Analysts predict that an unsupported Cairo could narrowly defeat most currently serving vessels, and Shivan destroyers as well. Factoring in the numerous wings of fighters and bombers contained within its bays and the Cairo is rightly seen as one of the most formidable PVN assets, a focus of power among the stars."

Développé pendant la Grande Guerre, le Phénix V possède une capacité d'ogive plus importante que l'Intercepteur. Bien qu'il ne soit certainement pas aussi maniable, le Phénix V est tout de même plus que capable d'éliminer presque toutes les cibles. Une paire d'entre eux qui touche au but détruira tous les bombardiers, sauf les plus robustes."
