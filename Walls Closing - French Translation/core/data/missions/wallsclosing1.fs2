$b -Situation

Alright everyone, let's get started. A few of you have been transferred to our squadron to replace our losses, so allow me to introduce myself. My name is Lieutenant Commander Jiminez, and I welcome you to the $g 309th $g Javelins Squadron.

Formed back in 2360, our squadron undertakes important missions ranging from warship escort to executing heavy strike operations. We're a multirole unit, allowing us to fill in any emergent gaps during ongoing engagements in a dynamic theatre of battle.", 5562)

 XSTR("$b -Situation $b (Continued)

The news coming from our blockade at the $b Capella node isn't good. $f GTVA forces assigned to its defence were torn apart by the $h Sathanas shortly after it arrived, and casualties are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. The juggernaut has since made the jump to $b Capella$| , where hopefully the $f Colossus and the rest of the allied fleet can take it down. Some pilots were able to knock out a few of its turrets, so it'll give our side a much needed edge in that battle. The Alliance has since retaken both the $b Capella node and the new one formed on the old site of the Knossos leading back to the nebula.

We don't know how long we'll be able to hold these positions. The $h Shivan offensive is strong, but we must hold them back to give the $f Colossus a fighting chance.", 5563)

 XSTR("$b -Defensive $b Operations

As you know, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine has been holding its position away from the nodes, launching squadrons to shore up our defences. The $f GTCv $f Warspite is currently overseeing our forces at the new node, while the $f GVCv $f Thebes stands guard at the one leading to $b Capella$| . The $f Psamtik is remaining in reserve, ready to counter any large Shivan attacks on our lines. The battle for $b Gamma $b Draconis is reaching its peak, and I expect all of you to do your part in showing everyone why the $g 309th is one of the best squadrons in the fleet.

Get down to the flight deck for your individual assignments, pilots. We're launching in ten minutes.", 5564)

Your mission was a success. Against overwhelming numbers your wing managed to contain the Shivan offensive in Gamma Draconis. Our forces were stretched thin, and communications were largely spent dealing with the situation at the nebula node. The battle in Capella was fierce, and the last thing the Alliance needed were for the Shivans to reinforce the Sathanas. 

At 03:45 hours, the GTVA Colossus successfully destroyed the Sathanas juggernaut. Rear-Admiral Kamak of the GVCv Arensnuphis informed us that the Sathanas' explosion released some sort of subspace-based energy that briefly blanketed the area around the node and hampered communications. This interference has since ceased and contact with Command has been reestablished, but you can bet allied scientists will be interested in this. I've also received a communique from Captain Edjet of the GVCv Thebes thanking your wing for protecting his ship. The Thebes is now on its way to Vega for repairs. Excellent work pilots.

Additionally, the GVC Cusae survived this engagement and is now enroute to Vega as well. The cruiser was forced to withdraw from the area around the former Knossos as the Shivan offensive intensified. Thanks to your cover, that cruiser will continue to serve the Alliance well.

However, there is a matter of pressing concern, so you've got fifteen minutes before you're needed in the ready room. Do whatever you need to do quickly. No rest for the weary huh?", 5579)
