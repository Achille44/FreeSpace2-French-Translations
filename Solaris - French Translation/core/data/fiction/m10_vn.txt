MSGXSTR "McKearney" 2783 "I just wanted to message and apologise for not telling you about my involvement with ANI. I understand if you're still upset at me." 5055 "10a-10"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 2783 "You told me it's like you can't trust me anymore, but everything I've told you, where I'm from, my family back home, it's all real." 5056 "10a-11"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 2783 "I was an intel agent a long time ago. Two years ago I left ANI and joined up with the regular fleet." 5057 "10a-12"

MSGXSTR "McKearney" 2783 "ANI are bastards. All of them. But now I realise I can't just leave. I have to see this through. Is it just me or do you feel the same, Stuart?" 5062 "10a-17"
