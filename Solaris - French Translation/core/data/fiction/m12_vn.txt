MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Welcome aboard, newcomer! Please take a moment to read through this orientation guide to familiarise yourself with the Hoshikuzu and her crew." 5836 "12a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "The Hoshikuzu is a one-of-a-kind corvette that started life as a Rasputin-class transport before being sold for scrap." 5837 "12a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "She was salvaged and converted into an armed corvette by Katherine Lau, her current captain." 5838 "12a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Her reactor and impeller was replaced with a military-grade unit, and her engines operate at more than two hundred percent efficiency. She is a hare with a lion's heart." 5839 "12a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Along with her new 40mm chaingun PDCs, she carries two gunships and several repair drones for support." 5840 "12a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Katherine Lau is the ship's captain. She decides who joins and leaves the ship. All who work hard are welcome. Those who misbehave are asked to leave." 5841 "12a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Derek Kaur is the ship's engineer and keeps the power running. He's a Great War veteran, and he loves only vodka more than machines." 5842 "12a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Verma Erikson runs tactical and weapons. She's a mystery but no one knows guns better than her. If you manage to find out anything about her past, share it with me." 5843 "12a-08"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Dodo Meiks is one half of the gunship pilot team. He's a Caledonian through and through and is the only one that can match Kaur drink for drink." 5844 "12a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Finally there's Stuart Ross, the other gunship jockey. He's a bit of a lone wolf, but you can depend on him for anything." 5845 "12a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "I hope your time aboard the Hoshikuzu is a positive experience. If you have any questions about this orientation guide, just send over a comms." 5846 "12a-12"

SHOWICON kaur file="portrait_kaur" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "Hello Ross. You're probably wondering how I fit into this family. A few weeks ago I helped Lau outfit the Hoshikuzu with the new reactor, and I figured I might as well stay for the ride." 5849 "12a-13"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "Lau's rewarded me with the jobs she doesn't want to do herself, so I'm running double duty on reactor and gunship maintenance. I'll be the one maintaining your craft." 5850 "12a-14"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "I don't know if Lau told you yet, but I think you should know ahead of time. I'm Combine, of old Sol vintage. I remember when we used to rule the galaxy, back before the Great War." 5851 "12a-15"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "These Sinarussians, they do things a little differently but I don't follow most of it myself. I leave the politics to the politicians. You live long enough, you make peace with the things you can't control." 5852 "12a-16"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "So, your gunships. They're versatile little machines that can mount most weapon systems out there. Right now we're limited to basic equipment, but things will change when Lau gets us some more advanced weapons." 5853 "12a-17"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "Unfortunately I can't do much about their agility. Having said that, the engines are powerful enough and can get you to a decent speed, so long as you fly in a straight line." 5854 "12a-18"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5848 "Anyway, it's good to meet you Ross. If you need anything for your gunship, or just want advice from someone who's seen it all, come find me. Welcome aboard." 5855 "12a-19"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Our client is Trinity Holdings, a major trade cartel headquartered here at Azar station. They've posted out a contract to investigate a distress call from one of their freighters." 5857 "12a-21"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "No details on what to expect, but the Hoshikuzu and your gunships should have more than enough firepower to deal with any raiders we're likely to encounter. Your gunships are fully stocked with kinetic rounds and missiles." 5860 "12a-24"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Our mission is to safeguard the Compass Rose and her cargo while rendering assistance to her crew." 5861 "12a-25"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Since this is going to be your first outing with us, I'll go through the game plan once more before we head out." 5862 "12a-26"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Your gunships are too small to have their own hyperspace impeller, so you two will ride docked on the Hoshikuzu's fighter rails when we enter hyperspace." 5863 "12a-27"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Once we enter the area, undock your gunships from the Hoshikuzu to initiate flight operations." 5864 "12a-28"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "You'll be weapons free after that. Watch your fire though, the Hoshikuzu may be armoured but I don't want her to take any more damage than she needs to." 5865 "12a-29"
