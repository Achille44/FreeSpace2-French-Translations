 XSTR("For the attention of Sublieutenant Laporte,

Welcome to your new home, Sublieutenant Laporte. I'm Captain Sorensen, and I'm proud to call the $g Indus mine. I'm glad that you made the decision to join up with my ship and crew. I'm also aware that you come with high commendations from Captain Telfer, so I know that you will serve this ship with distinction and valour.

In the wake of Steele's massive raid against $f Earth, $r GTVA forces have largely withdrawn to $r Jupiter sector to resupply and regroup. Raids against Earth Sector continue, but for the most part, $f Second $f Fleet is under only limited strategic pressure. $f Fleet $f Admiral $f Netreba is in conference with $f Fleet $f Admiral $f Calder of the $f Jovian $f Rim $f Fleet survivors, and by all indications it looks like some major operation is about to commence.

I'll leave you under the care of your squadron leader. I believe you two have met.

 XSTR("For the attention of Sublieutenant Laporte,

Simms here. We've been introduced before. Welcome to the Indus.  I'm sorry I wasn't on deck to see you in. I read over your jacket. You're clearly a skilled pilot, if still a little green. I need that talent to rebuild this squadron.

I want to make it clear that things operate differently here in Two Fleet. The Martian military has a reputation for rowdiness and 'vivacious behavior'. This reputation is well-earned, but it doesn't mean you can be insubordinate without consequence. It's esprit de corps, not poor discipline, that keeps Two Fleet running.

There are only a few veteran pilots left on the Indus, so don't worry if we don't go crazy over the arrival of you and your fellow replacements. We're at the front lines. We've seen a lot of faces come and go. Don't expect a shiny badge or a badass squadron name$semicolon we're out here to do our jobs, not to fly air shows.

Welcome aboard.

Hey Laporte. I just got word of your transfer to the Indus. You may remember me from the Nauticus incident. I'm de facto squadron leader aboard the Yangtze, since our CAG is a psychological casualty. Lorna Simms and I go way back.

Admiral Netreba is about to select forces for a big joint operation against the GTVA. Two months ago the Indus was the best frigate in Two Fleet, and Lorna Simms was a rising star. She got that job because five officers before her couldn't hack it.

But the last few weeks have really wrecked her. The Indus air wing has been running a 400% casualty rate. Simms and Flight Lieutenant Levi are about the only two left from the original squadron. Replacements show up and die almost daily.

Word has it that Lorna doesn't give her pilots callsigns any more, just numbers. The crew chief says that she's banned the flight deck from painting names on their ships. I think all the new pilots have turned into one long red blur for her. Worse, I think she prefers it that way. And all those rooks can tell. It's killing morale.", 9340)

Ultra-high performance interceptor and precision strike craft. Massively variable hull geometry. High afterburner velocity with good sustainability. Capable of reverse thrust.

Mounts Rapier cannon for anti-fighter attack and precision Paveway bombs on external racks for strikes against heavily defended targets at long range.

Survivability inside beam and flak envelopes is low.

Pilots transitioning to the Kentauroi from the Uhlan space superiority fighter are advised to practise with simulator modules and attain hands-on experience before combat.

I hear you and the other new transfers have been bitching about the lack of training sorties. I get that. I mean, if I didn't know this ship flew a couple dozen sorties a day off a slot deck, overworking a deck crew that gets four-hour sleep shifts and hasn't had a leave day in almost nine weeks, I'd be bitching for more flight time too. And I just assume you don't know all that.

Anyway, today's your lucky day, Laporte. I'm taking you out for some hands-on time with your Kentauroi. Get used to the cockpit, the new avionics, all that. Sound good?", 9343)

Your goal is to jolt Captain Simms out of her guilt-fueled death spiral.

In my experience, Simms responds well to confidence and plain talk, but if you're too by-the-book she'll just ignore you. If you can demonstrate intelligence or experience, she'll listen. But failing that, she does some of her best thinking when angry. 

Just don't patronize or disrespect her or her abilities. And while she responds to honest emotion, don't get too empathic. She hates that. If you criticize her, criticize her professionally, not personally.

The worst thing you can do is convince her you're an idiot. She'll tolerate a surprising amount of insurbordination as long as it's going somewhere.

Once you've raised the topic, don't back down. ", 9347)

Yeah, okay. I'm not gonna close down our briefing closet for a two-pilot debrief. Lieutenant Levi's in there showing off his ACM footage anyway.

Get that zipper for me? ...thanks. Okay, we did good out there. Didn't lose anyone. Burnt some fuel, rattled some Tev raiders, good for morale. You can fly. I like that. Need good fliers for our next big op.

Look, uh. I appreciate the pointers about my command attitude. You're getting the hang of the Martian style, and what's more, you're probably right. I'm sick of making new friends and then losing them, but these new guys need a leader.

But keep in mind - rank matters, even in Two Fleet. One more outburst like that, whether Karen's behind it or not, and you'll be in the brig for insubordination. Granted, it'll only last ten minutes because I'll need you to fill out the roster, but...yeah, okay, you get it.

You like the Kentauroi? Hahah, yeah, thought so. That afterburner - wham! Beautiful kick.

Beta wing chased off an Aurora shadowing us. He must've traced our jump out and passed it to those Nyx. Steele puts the pressure on every damn inch of the Fleet, and we're not even his primary goal.

Right. Look. One more thing. I'm, uh, I'm pretty flattered by your attentions, but we've got to sort something out. Don't get me wrong, I'll tumble a pilot off another ship fast as the next woman, but in the same squadron, that's a no-go. So I'm afraid you're getting shot down at least once today, Laporte. No more schoolgirl flirt after missions.
