4003, "Après le succès du Myrmidon, RNI Systems a immédiatement commencé à travailler sur la conception d'un autre vaisseau, cette fois beaucoup plus lourd. Le résultat fut le chasseur d'assaut lourd Azaes. Conçu pour maximiser son mélange de technologies terriennes et vasudiennes, l'Azaes est un bombardier d'assaut, doté d'un bon bouclier, d'un blindage épais et d'une grande capacité de missiles. Toutefois, comme c'est le cas pour les hybrides vasudo-terriens, le vaisseau conserve une vitesse et une maniabilité modérément bonnes. La principale caractéristique de l'Azaes est le Canon automatique $quoteMaul$quote monté le long des flancs du vaisseau. Ces canons massifs, d'une longueur totale de près de 15 mètres, avec des tubes de 5 mètres de long, sont capables de mettre en pièces des coques dépourvues de bouclier. Associé à une bonne capacité de tir de missiles et à une arme à énergie primaire à quatre canons, l'Azaes est une force à craindre pour les petits vaisseaux capitaux."

Combinant les capacités antichasseurs et la vitesse de l'Éole surclassé et le blindage du Léviathan, l'Hypérion est une cible redoutable pour les vaisseaux d'attaque. En outre, il a été équipé de deux canons à photons avancés, qui tirent leur puissance directement des moteurs principaux. Un cran au-dessus de l'armement standard d'un croiseur, l'Hypérion est aussi puissant qu'un Déimos avec un équipage beaucoup plus réduit. L'Hypérion remplit rapidement les rangs de la GTVA, éliminant progressivement les modèles de croiseurs précédents."

La conséquence en est un blindage et une vitesse légèrement réduits par rapport à l'Iceni, mais le Saphah reste un vaisseau puissant. Les rumeurs selon lesquelles les principales failles de sécurité qui ont conduit à l'évasion de l'Iceni au cours du conflit du NTF ont été orchestrées afin de recueillir des données sur le vaisseau pour le projet Saphah ont été vigoureusement démenties par les dirigeants de la GTVI."

4585, "On vous a proposé et vous avez accepté une invitation à rejoindre la GTAII ou Renseignements Anti-Insurrectionnel Terriens Galactiques, officieusement appelée NeoIntel par ses membres. Vous avez passé avec brio nos rigoureuses évaluations psychologiques et physiques. Nous vous souhaitons la bienvenue à NeoIntel, agent."

4586, "NeoIntel a été formé peu après la Rébellion de l'Hadès perpétrée par les membres d'élite de l'ancienne GTI, ou Renseignements Terriens Galactiques. Nous avons été formés par le Conseil de Sécurité Terrien Galactique et sommes en activité depuis lors. Notre mission principale est de rechercher et d'éliminer les insurrections politiques ou militaires, de préférence lorsqu'elles sont encore embryonnaires. C'est un agent de NeoIntel qui a alerté la GTVA de la menace du NTF et ce sont les pilotes de NeoIntel qui ont éliminé les derniers vestiges du Marteau de Lumière. Avec NeoIntel, vous rejoignez un long et fier héritage."

4587, "Nous opérons dans le plus grand secret ici à NeoIntel. La GTVA, la GTVI et l'Imperium Vasudien n'ont pas connaissance de notre existence. Nous ne répondons qu'au Conseil de Sécurité Terrien Galactique. Ce secret est de la plus haute importance. L'une des principales tâches de NeoIntel est de surveiller l'utilisation et les éventuels abus de pouvoir de la GTVI. Comme l'a montré la Rébellion de l'Hadès, le pouvoir concentré de la GTI et de l'actuelle GTVI peut être une puissante force corruptrice."

4588, "Au cours de vos missions, agent, on peut vous demander de réaliser des objectifs inhabituels, voire contraires à l'éthique. Comprenez que tout ce que nous faisons est pour le plus grand bien de la race humaine. Agissez sur ordre en mission sans poser de questions. Les réponses vous seront toujours données une fois la mission terminée ou lorsqu'il y a une accalmie dans l'action. Pour voler pour NeoIntel, vous devez agir rapidement et de manière décisive. Les secondes comptent dans ce domaine."

4589, "Pour faciliter le secret de NeoIntel, nous utilisons souvent des chasseurs vasudiens ou même des chasseurs shiviens capturés afin de cacher notre identité. Notre efficacité en tant qu'organisation dépend de l'absence totale de connaissance concernant notre existence."

4590, "Vous avez été affecté au destroyer de commandement de NeoIntel, l'Achille. Comme vous le savez peut-être, l'Achille a disparu il y a plusieurs années de façon inexplicable. Beaucoup de vaisseaux de notre flotte sont des vaisseaux fantômes sous une forme ou une autre. L'Achille, ainsi que la 5ème Flotte d'Exploration Terrienne Galactique, ont aidé à éliminer une récente insurrection vasudienne impliquant un second destroyer Hadès, nom de code Dante. Pour autant que l'on sache, il n'y a pas eu d'insurrection et l'Achille est toujours porté disparu."

4591, "Au sein de NeoIntel, votre désignation est Agent 750. Je suis l'Agent 33. Je suis sure que vous aimeriez avoir l'opportunité de vous installer, mais nous avons un besoin urgent de ces compétences de chasseur. Vous serez déployé dans l'heure. Rendez-vous à votre briefing, agent."

4592, "Très bien, agents, passons aux choses sérieuses. Comme il y a quelques nouveaux visages ici, je vais essayer de vous mettre au courant. Nous avons observé un certain Amiral Misraïm de très près ces six derniers mois. Misraïm est un Vasudien aussi xénophobe que possible, exposant publiquement sa conviction que l'interaction avec les Terriens finira par miner la société vasudienne. Malheureusement, en raison de son pouvoir et de son influence, ces opinions ont de bonnes chances de devenir une politique."

Nous avons décidé que c'est le moment opportun pour éliminer cet élément perturbateur avant qu'il ne puisse transformer ses opinions en politique gouvernementale vasudienne, et peut-être même miner la BETAC."

4603, "Pour cacher le fait que des Terriens participent à cette opération, vous piloterez des chasseurs vasudiens. Un AWACS vasudien, appelé Tartare, assurera la couverture de brouillage pour cette mission. Nous espérons qu'une faction vasudienne opposée à Misraïm sera impliquée dans sa mort."

4604, "Cependant, Misraïm, bien que méfiant envers les humains, est un brillant tacticien. Avec un certain degré de... conditionnement... nous pensons que nous pouvons faire de Misraïm un atout précieux pour NeoIntel. Par conséquent, c'est une opération de capture. Bêta engagera les chasseurs pendant qu'Alpha désactive et désarme l'Anqet."

4605, "Une fois que toute opposition a été éliminée, un transport commando, désignation Panzer, sera amené pour monter à bord de l'Anqet et appréhender Misraïm. Une fois Misraïm capturé, le commando posera des explosifs et détruira l'Anqet ainsi que toute preuve de la disparition de Misraïm."

4606, "Nous avons programmé cette opération pour qu'elle coïncide avec un trafic minimal de nœuds. Cependant, il est possible que certains vaisseaux émergent. Si cela se produit, vous êtes autorisé et tenu d'éliminer tous les vaisseaux. Nous devons nous assurer que personne n'est témoin de cette opération. L'escadrille Gamma se tiendra prête à fournir une assistance supplémentaire, si nécessaire."

4607, "Excellent travail, Agent 750. Votre première mission avec NeoIntel a été un succès complet et total. Misraïm est sous notre garde et nos spécialistes en psychologie vont commencer à le reconditionner pour nos besoins. Une fois cela terminé, je n'ai aucun doute que Misraïm aura beaucoup à apporter à NeoIntel.

Vous avez aussi assuré le secret de cette opération. Bien que désagréable, l'élimination de tous les vaisseaux entrant dans la zone était nécessaire pour le plus grand bien de la GTVA. Les vies perdues aujourd'hui auraient été dérisoires en comparaison des vies perdues dans une autre guerre civile éventuelle. Vous devez être félicité pour votre rigueur.

Cependant, nous avons encore du travail à faire. Les rapports indiquent qu'alors que l'identité de NeoIntel était protégée, un groupe au sein de l'armée vasudienne a été impliqué dans la mort de Misraïm. Une situation très tendue entre deux groupements tactiques vasudiens est en train de se former. Si elle devient incontrôlable, nous enverrons une équipe pour stabiliser la situation.

C'est tout, agent. Encore une fois, excellent travail."

4608, "Personnellement, je ne supporte pas les Taourets, agent. Je préfère les Érinyes ou les Arès. En plus, cette odeur... les Vasudiens n'ont jamais entendu parler des douches ?"

4609, "Vous avez foiré la mission, agent. Nous attendions plus de vous, beaucoup plus que ça. Vos ailes sont suspendues jusqu'à nouvel ordre, en attendant une audience formelle de NeoIntel sur cette gaffe.

Rompez, pilote."

"

4712, "(fr)Our last operation has had unexpected consequences. Misraïm's followers, serving primarily within the 4th Vasudan Battlegroup, have accused the 9th Vasudan Battlegroup of assassinating their admiral. Apparently, the officers that comprise these two battlegroups are part of two Vasudan clans that regularly oppose one another. These clans have a violent and bloody history dating back thousands of years. "

4720, "(fr)Peace between the clans is driven by necessity, such as the need to fight the Shivans and defend their worlds. Without an overriding drive to cooperate, our abduction has resulted in the feud's reawakening. The 9th Vasudan Battlegroup decided to react to the accusations by attacking one of Misraïm's destroyers. Two corvettes, the Thebes and the Khnemu, comprise the bulk of the attack force."

4721, "(fr)The destroyer under attack is the Heliopolis, a Typhon-class vessel that is currently undergoing beam-weapon calibration in the Delta Serpentis system. In other words, the 9th is hitting the 4th while its down. If left alone, the Typhon destroyer will be lost."

4722, "(fr)NeoIntel will dispatch twelve fighters to pacify the situation, under the guise of GTVA squadrons. Alpha and Gamma will fly Erinyes and perform a sweep of the area, eliminating all Vasudan fighters and bombers. They're easy enough to replace. Beta will fly beam weapon suppression against the corvettes."

4723, "(fr)We will have to act quickly. Though the fighter engagement will likely be a draw, the Typhon will not last long against the beams of two corvettes."

4724, "(fr)Agent 750, we've heard your something of a hotshot when it comes to anti-beam work. If necessary, we will divert you from fighter/bomber suppression to anti-beam duty. Remember that Sobeks have two main beam cannons, their forward-most weapons. Target them by cycling or by using the V key on their cannon flares. Your load of Trebuchets should allow you to engage the Sobeks outside of their weapons range, though we do not expect any capital ships to target your fighters."

4725, "(fr)Hopefully, this will be enough to allow cooler heads to prevail. Without bombers or beam weapons on both sides, the engagement will end in a draw. Remember, we don't care about fighter or bomber losses. Corvettes and destroyers, however, are another matter. See to it that all three capital ships survive."

4726, "(fr)Excellent work, agent. Despite unforeseen intervention, all three capital ships survived the encounter. GTVA forces have arrived on scene and we expect the Heliopolis will be back in general service within two months."

4727, "(fr)This is truly impressive, agent. You performed above and beyond the call of duty."

4728, "(fr)Though we did lose the Heliopolis, there was little you could have done to save it against a beam weapon of that magnitude. We can take consolation in the fact that two corvettes were saved and no further hostilities seem to be occurring."

4729, "(fr)Don't worry about it. Crap like this happens."

4730, "(fr)Which brings us to that Terran attack on the Vasudans. We do not know who or why the attack took place. A capital ship of some kind, presumably Terran design, fired a beam weapon that registered like a Sathanas cannon. The fighters, while Great War era Lokis, were equipped with a new stealth technology our instruments could not penetrate.

As you know, the Loki was originally designed as a GTI stealth fighter and played a prominent role in both the Hades Rebellion and the recent NTF Civil War. While an aging design, we expect its features would be easily adaptable to more modern stealth technology. Therefore, we suspect you were up against a technological testbed of some kind.

Our final conclusion is this: someone decided to utilize the confusion of the battle to test two new systems on live targets. This group has access to advanced technology and precise intelligence. The list of suspects is very short."

4732, "(fr)You failed, agent. You were sent in to protect ALL capital ships and that is what we expected from you. Your wings are hereby suspended until further notice, pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into this blunder.

Dismissed, pilot."

4733, "(fr)Use your Trebuchets immediately against the corvettes.   One Trebuchet is enough for each beam cannon. Once that is done, finish off the fighters, then engage all successive waves, focusing on bombers. Take out the Heliopolis's main gun when ordered to. Watch out for the stealth fighters at the end. They carry Kayser weaponry."

Despite NeoIntel's extensive intelligence network, we knew nothing of Zohar's existence until recently.

Your primary objective is to find evidence related to the attack. Scan any ships I order you to. NeoIntel alone does not have the numbers for large-scale attacks. Therefore we need evidence to back up our assumptions in order to mobilize GTVA forces."

4816, "(fr)Garrison forces around Zohar are a complete unknown. If there are any ships of interest, I will order you to investigate. Remember, this is a stealth mission. Keep moving and do not fire your weapons unless necessary. This is the kind of base where they shoot first and don't bother with questions."

4817, "(fr)Your secondary objective is to scan any vessels entering the area. We may catch another operation returning to their base or perhaps incoming supplies. Any and all data is desired by our analysts. Good luck, agent. Keep your head down out there."

4818, "(fr)Thanks to your diligent efforts, we now have incontrovertible proof that the attack originated from Zohar. The beam was fired from the Proteus, one of the two science vessels you scanned, and the Loki configurations were identical to those you encountered earlier.

However, we do not know who was behind the attack. Was it the Antietam's commanding officer, Admiral Hossel? Or was it a subordinate? More importantly, why did the attack take place? We will continue to watch Zohar and the Antietam closely, acting only when we have undeniable proof of guilt.

You also assisted in gathering data on Zohar's Ganymede Cannon, the Saphah frigates, the uncharted node, and the Antietam itself. All of this data will be poured over by NeoIntel analysts, allowing us to gain a better picture of what the GTVI and Admiral Hossel are doing at Zohar."

4819, "(fr)Well, at least you got to blow up SOMETHING . . . even if it was a radar dish."

4820, "(fr)You also were able to scan the two vessels heading for the node. The presence of a gas miner and an AWACS indicates that the uncharted system MAY have nebular areas, though this is purely guesswork without actually passing through the node."

Unfortunately, it would seem our suspicions were correct. The Vulcain testbed was piloted straight back to Zohar. Crewmen from Admiral Hossel's command ship, the Antietam, then boarded the vessel and stripped it of its experimental systems.

Admiral Hossel, an officer of profound stature and professionalism, has been plotting against the GTVA. It is a sad day indeed when such an officer AND his subordinates turn against all that we hold dear.

We now have more than enough proof to warrant a large scale operation against the Zohar installation. Whatever Admiral Hossel's designs are, we will crush them utterly in one swift stroke.

5002, "(fr)Alpha wing, you will immediately go to full burners and destroy all stealth Lokis. Our latest intelligence indicates that there are eighteen fighters parked outside Zohar. From evidence we have gathered elsewhere, we believe these fighters to be pilotless drones. Therefore, they may take some time to activate. Use that time to kill them."

5003, "(fr)With the station's primary defenses down, we may then move in and engage the renegade GTVI forces at close range. However, keep in mind that our primary objective is to destroy Zohar. Eliminate Hossel's base of operations and it is only a matter of time before his remaining forces are routed. If the Antietam or any other ship escapes, we will follow."

Our scouting forces are now pursuing Admiral Hossel's fleet, consisting of the GTD Antietam, GTF Shiloh, GTF Pharsalus, and GTCv Longret. Also, the Ganymede Cannon, which we thought was a fixed installation, has jumped to an unknown location. The fleet has now retreated to another GTVI base under Admiral Hossel's direction.

However, though the mission was a success, we are disturbed by Admiral Hossel's knowledge of us. How he acquired such information is puzzling indeed. To route out any possible leaks, I have initiated multiple internal investigations. Anyone found divulging information to the enemy will be summarily executed.

Prepare for your next mission, pilot. It's time to finish off Admiral Hossel's fleet."

"

5075, "(fr)Agents, given the seriousness of the situation with Hossel, I have granted you clearance level Epsilon. You are now authorized to receive a briefing on the Orpheus Project. Q, NeoIntel's Director of Technology will deliver this briefing."

5076, "(fr)Greetings agents.
During the second Shivan incursion, advanced fighters like the Erynies proved very effective against this terrible enemy. But the Erynies was also a rushed design: very expensive, difficult to maintain, and with several design flaws. Two other fighters were in competition with the Erynies at that time. However, the urgency of the situation demanded that the Erynies be put into service as it was the only craft to have completed flight testing. As the war reached its end, the GTVA decided to restart the Orpheus project. The two other prototypes, had undergone extensive refinement such that they came up to the required standards for the Orpheus Multi role Fighter Project:"

5077, "(fr)The Ézéchiel is the first try at spacecraft for Sénécal Hydrospace, a company specialized in submarines and surface ships. Sénécal already had experience in the spaceship industry, however, as they have been the manufacturers for most subspace drives for light spaceships to date. Furthermore they have the proud heritage of being the ones who built the subspace reading device that helped track the Lucifer on the famous mission which dealt the final blow to the Shivan war machine during the Great War."

5078, "(fr)The Ézéchiel is an surprising mix of old and new technology. Based on a rather conventional frame, it features a couple of intriguing systems to meet the Orpheus Project directives.
The ship is a rather stocky and heavy fighter. Survivability is improved by very thick armor and strong shields. If its secondary payload can be considered light, it still packs an awesome punch thanks to eight gun mounts located on the two side rails of the ship.
These rails also serve to meet the speed requirements of the OP. While four high impulse deuterium engines are used in cruise, the ship can reach a tremendous speed for a short period of time thanks to the two side rails. These rails use Subspace Gliding Rail technology, or SGR, to open localized rifts between space and subspace."

5079, "(fr)We have tracked down Admiral Hossel's fleet to yet another installation situated near the unrecorded jump node in Ross 128. However, Hossel's forces appear to be entering the node en masse. The only ships that can reach the base in time are four Ézéchiels."

5083, "(fr)The Achille and additional fighter support are en route, but are still a jump away from Hossel's base. Alpha wing, we're going to depend heavily on you for this mission's success."

5084, "(fr)Our intelligence of Hossel's operations near this node indicates that he is abandoning the base and heading through the node. Therefore, your objective will be to destroy as many of the departing craft as possible. You won't be a match for any of Hossel's warships, so restrict your engagements to transports and freighters. Don't let a single transport reach the node."

5085, "(fr)Though most of the known Hossel forces, including the GTF Shiloh, GTF Pharsalus, and GTCv Longret, are proceeding into the node, we have no intelligence on the location of the Antietam. However, we expect it to arrive at the base before you do."

5086, "(fr)Panther"

5087, "(fr)Remember, Hossel's forces may deploy advanced technologies such as Shivan weaponry and the new stealth system. Hossel has had access to all the resources of the GTVI for a substantial period of time and could have a few more surprises up his sleeves. Be prepared for anything, agents."

5088, "(fr)Once Hossel's fleet has abandoned the base, we may choose to capture what remains. If so, we have one Elysium-class transport crewed with engineers and marines standing by. If deployed, defend Panther and the Alcides installation until we have captured any desirable materials. Good luck, agents. Time to show Hossel just how horrible a mistake he's made."

5089, "(fr)I have good news and I have bad news, Agent 750.

First, we did destroy a great quantity of Admiral Hossel's war material departing the Alcides base. Cursory analysis of the wreckage using your flight recorder indicates the convoy was carrying examples of Shivan technology and warship construction materials. Excellent work depriving our enemy of those supplies.

We also captured the SCv Metatron, a corvette that Hossel had probably captured during the recent Shivan incursion that ended in the destruction of the Capella star. We believe Hossel's engineers have reverse engineered many of the Metatron's systems, allowing them insight into Shivan technologies.

Our analysis of the battle indicates that those Lokis were cheaply constructed automated bombs, perhaps leftover stealth testbeds. Also, I'm sure you noticed that the Antietam's beam weaponry was not operational during the fight. Our analysts believe the Antietam may be hastily upgrading its beam weaponry to Shivan standards using materials from Zohar.

Now the really bad news. Admiral Hossel has convinced GTVA Command that NeoIntel is plotting an open rebellion against the Alliance. Command responded by dispatching the 2nd Fleet to hunt us down.

I have attempted to contact the Terran Security Council in order to explain the situation, with no success. The government we served for so long believes we are the traitors Hossel claims us to be and . . . have abandoned us. We are on our own.

We must act quickly, agents. We not only must continue to hunt Hossel down, as is our duty as agents of NeoIntel, but we must avoid confrontation with the 2nd Fleet."

We have let our prey, the true rebel Admiral Hossel, slip from our grasp, and are now hunted by those we sought to defend."

5172, "(fr)The 2nd Fleet, lead by Admiral Brennin of the GTD Agamemnon, has been placed in charge of bringing us to justice. Since we will not surrender, we can expect 2nd Fleet forces to shoot on sight. Though it may become necessary to openly engage GTVA forces, we MUST keep their casualties to a minimum."

5173, "(fr)Meanwhile, Admiral Hossel's forces have disappeared from Alliance space. Though we have suspected for some time that his ultimate goal is rebellion, we do not know how he plans to carry out such an act. The forces we have engaged would not last long against the Alliance, even battered as it is from the war against the Shivans."

5174, "(fr)The only way we can survive this is by finding concrete evidence of Hossel's true goals and the means he intends to use. To do this, we will have to follow him into uncharted space while outpacing the 2nd Fleet. To do this, we have planned a series of operations to keep us alive long enough to achieve victory."

Because of your diligent defense of the late NeoIntel Headquarters, the Achille, and transport Omaha, we were able to evacuate all command personnel. I have personally transferred over to the Achille, which will serve as our Command and Control until this crisis is resolved.

However, in the confusion of the battle, Former Vasudan Admiral Misraïm managed to escape. It would appear that our conditioning was not completely successful, and our blunder resulted in his aid to Hossel. I fear we will meet that creature again, and all too soon."

5260, "(fr)Agents, we are going to hit and destroy that science vessel convoy, and we're going to do it with Shivan craft. The Metatron, formerly in Admiral Hossel's inventory, was almost completely stripped down. We have refitted it with Shivan weaponry and consider it stable enough to risk in combat. Alpha wing will fly Maras while Epsilon flies captured Dragons."

5261, "(fr)Hopefully, the unexpected presence of Shivans near the node will lure at least some of Admiral Brennin's fleet toward us. The Metatron will engage in a prolonged offensive, destroying all vessels that enter the area until 2nd Fleet warships arrive."

5262, "(fr)If enemy corvettes or cruisers are deployed against the Metatron, we will deploy Delta wing's captured Nahemas. Remember, agents, we cannot afford to lose even a single warship at this stage. The Metatron MUST survive!"

5263, "(fr)Excellent work, Agent 750! Two out of three destroyers from the 2nd Fleet have been drawn off. With only the GTD Ajax still in a position to pursue us, our chances of survival have greatly increased. Hopefully, we will be able to make a run for the uncharted nodes without the Ajax detecting us.

Our scouting wings have already made a cursory analysis of the systems beyond the two nodes. Surprisingly, it would seem the nodes both lead to nebular systems. Gaseous analysis indicates that the two nodes may lead to the same system, which is likely considering the fact that we have viewed Hossel's forces entering both nodes.

I have ordered the Achille and nearly all of our remaining fleet into the nodes. The hunt for Admiral Hossel has resumed."

Agent 750, you will have authorization to call in Delta wing, should you require additional support. Remember, your shields won't work out there, but the Ézéchiel's heavy armor should keep you alive long enough to reach Kappa 2."

5326, "(fr)This is grave indeed, Agent 750. Somehow, Admiral Hossel has managed to construct a massive juggernaut: designation Titan.   This rebellion of his must have been years in the works.

The Titan's modular design appears partly to explain how Hossel could construct so large a ship without being detected. The Titan is made up of a large number of modules connected to a massive frame. We have traced the registration numbers of the cargo containers discovered in the nebula. Analysis of cargo manifests associated with them indicate that Hossel had these modules constructed in a number of shipyards in the guise of components needed for new GTVI installations. These modules were then spirited away to the nebula where they were assembled and armed with Shivan derived weaponry.   We must now deal with the problem of destroying such an incredible vessel and of warning the Alliance about the true threat.

Imagine this, agent: a juggernaut-class vessel, armed to the teeth with recreated Shivan weaponry, its hangar full of Terran and Shivan fighters. THAT, I fear, is what we are about to face."

5387, "(fr)Since beam system targeting is iffy in this nebula, we've had to improvise. What we've come up with is a combination AWACS-TAG system. Agent 750, you will tag incoming capital ships while the Seer masks our ship's locations and provides additional targeting data. Once a ship is tagged, all beam cannons will be brought to bear. One tag hit should be enough per ship."

5388, "(fr)Due to the dangerous nature of flying unshielded fighters against enemy capital ships, we will deploy only one fighter, YOU, piloting a Pegasus stealth fighter. Remember, keep moving and enemy ships shouldn't be able to target you."

5389, "(fr)We suspect that the AWACS will come under attack during the mission. We've linked our anti-fighter beams to the TAG system as well, so your missiles will be equally effective against fighters. Just remember, you NEED your tags for capital ships. Use your guns against fighters if you can."

5390, "(fr)The objective is to eliminate ALL vessels heading for the node. If we achieve this, then the Alliance will only have to deal with rebellion on a single front.

5453, "(fr)The Titan is quite possibly the most powerful vessel ever constructed, surpassing both the Colossus and even Sathanas-class juggernauts.

The Ganymede Cannon is capable of accelerating explosive projectiles to extreme sublight speeds, effectively giving the base no defense to the attack."

5462, "(fr)With two 2nd Fleet destroyers, the Ajax and the Messana, taking on supplies and numerous smaller vessels receiving repairs, Hossel will be able to crush almost the entire 2nd Fleet in one fell swoop. We will not allow this to happen."

5463, "(fr)Before the attack takes place, we will sortie the Achille and launch a half-hearted attack against 2nd Fleet Headquarters. Since the Alliance still believes that NeoIntel forces are hostile towards them, we can expect severe retaliation. Alpha and Beta wings will provide close-in support against any bombers launched against the Achille."

5464, "(fr)With some luck, we will be able to draw the attention of both the Ajax and the Messana. Using the Achille as bait, we will jump out in the hopes that both destroyers will pursue us."

5465, "(fr)With the main warships gone, only the 2nd Fleet Headquarters and the numerous minor vessels undergoing repairs will be lost. These are acceptable losses."

5466, "(fr)Also, be advised that an opportunity may arise to destroy the Ganymede Cannon. If so, we will deploy the Minsk and additional craft to destroy the cannon. Defend the Minsk if she is deployed. Good luck, pilots. Let's see if we can make the 2nd Fleet angry."

5467, "(fr)Excellent work, Agent 750. The Ajax, Messana, Minsk, and Achille all survived the battle. Unfortunately, 2nd Fleet Headquarters was lost along with two corvettes and five cruisers. We can take some consolation in the fact that the Ganymede Cannon was also destroyed.

The appearance of former-Admiral Misraïm on one of Hossel's frigates is disturbing. Though we knew he was assisting Admiral Hossel with information during his tenure at NeoIntel, we did not expect Misraïm to be placed in command of one of Hossel's warships! Fortunately, this seems to be a double-edge sword for Hossel, as Misraïm demonstrated that he has his own agenda in all of this.

Now, agents, there is no time to rest. You will be dispatch immediately on another mission. The fires of revolution are spreading and I fear we are the only ones who can stop it."

Control of the station shifts between Terrans and Vasudans according to each fleet's training requirement. Presently, a Vasudan training command occupies the station."

5551, "(fr)Admiral Hossel has deployed two Hypérion cruisers refitted with the Vulcain anti-fighter system. Though we knew Hossel had acquired the technology from the GTVI testbed, we are indeed surprised by the speed with which the technology has been implemented."

5552, "(fr)The Hypaspists and the Phalanx utilize advanced beam targeting, allowing them to strike fighters at nearly 4000 meters. This, coupled with a heavy screen of flak cannons, makes these cruisers true terrors for fighters to attack."

5553, "(fr)Since NeoIntel is engaged in numerous battles against both Alliance and Renegade forces, we will deploy only three of our Vasudan craft to the area. Alpha 1, your task will be to destroy both the Hypaspists and the Phalanx. Epsilon will cover you. Destroy turrets at long range with your Trebuchets or Maxim cannons, then close in with your torpedoes."

5554, "(fr)You will be flying the GVB Ouadjet, a prototype stealth bomber. This craft features the same weapons capacity of the GVB Sekhmet but is invisible to normal sensors. This, hopefully, will prevent the beams from locking onto you at extreme range. We don't know how close you can get before they lock on, so keep your distance until you've taken down enough turrets."

5555, "(fr)Once the two Vulcain-class cruisers have been destroyed, you will join in the defense of Aquilae Station."

5556, "(fr)We believe that additional forces will strike at Aquilae Station. The Vulcain cruisers, while supremely adept at anti-fighter work, probably have had their anti-capital ship beams removed. If an overwhelming force arrives, your objective will be to record their exit vectors so that we may track Hossel's fleet through subspace."

5557, "(fr)We anticipated the destruction of Aquilae Station. Even though its protection was not a priority, it is troubling to lose yet another installation to Hossel's fleet. However, even as the Alliance takes these losses, we are whittling away at Hossel's fleet.

To your credit, the Hypaspists, the Phalanx, and the Europa were all successfully destroyed. The attack by those three ships seemed to be designed to clear away any potential threat from fighter craft, opening up Aquilae Station for the Shiloh and Antietam.

This was also the first large-scale use by Hossel of his Shivan weaponry, giving his capital ships a distinct advantage over our own in both anti-fighter and anti-ship arenas.

NeoIntel is doing all it can to stem the flow of history, but our forces have been continually hindered by the Alliance's idiocy in blaming us for the attacks. Fortunately, the mounting evidence of Hossel's treachery and of our own assistance is easing NeoIntel-Alliance relations. We hope to reach an accord with the GTVA soon.

Get some rest while you can, agent. You'll be launching in a few hours once again."

Even though the location of these negotiations are a secret, consider an attack to be a strong possibility. Hossel's intelligence-gathering abilities have surprised us before. Good luck, agents."

5597, "(fr)Good work, Agent 750. Though Admiral Brennin and the GTD Agamemnon have been lost, we were able to secure a ceasefire with Alliance forces, a critical step in our campaign against Admiral Hossel.

However, today we witnessed firsthand what a truly awesome weapon the Titan is. A frontal assault using capital ships is simply not feasible. And given the impressive array of flak guns, AAA beams, and turrets the Titan has, a fighter/bomber assault is equally daunting.

NeoIntel and Alliance forces are now working in full cooperation. With our pooled resources and intelligence, we plan to isolate and destroy the spread-out ships comprising Hossel's fleet. It is finally time to end our defensive engagements and to take the fight to Hossel himself."

5799, "(fr)Titan�s End "

5800, "(fr)Agents, I received word some hours ago, GTVA command has finally decided that taking out the Titan is our top priority.
Since Hossel�s movements indicate that he is planning to attack Vasudan controlled space first, we have moved the Achille to Vasuda and are gathering with the 9th and 4th Fleet.
Additionally, any other ship stationed here in Vasuda, including the personal ship of the Emperor and the whole 1st Vasudan Fleet, will join us in this battle."

5801, "(fr)Furthermore, Emperor Khonsu III of Vasuda himself will be present on his ship, as he sees the need to raise the morale of his soldiers. He is going to deliver a speech momentarily, Agents. You are to attend."

5802, "(fr)Soldiers,
Many of thee hath lost brethren when the traitor Hossel had some of the best vessels of 9th and 4th Fleet destroyed, or when he slew some of our youngest pilots at Aquilae Station.

Be not dismayed though, my kin, because today thou shalt avenge those of thy bretheren, that have been slain by the enemy. Thou shalt return victorious, and in the glory of thy fortitude thou shalt be immersed.

On thy valor resteth the hopes of thy kin today$semicolon and what surer grounds can they rest upon? Oppression now attempteth to bend thee down to servility$semicolon wilt thou burst its chains and rise to the independence of true Vasudan warriors? Thy cause is one approved by Heaven."

5803, "(fr)Thou seeketh not the oppression of others$semicolon Thou fightest for thy kindred and sacred altars. It is a cause that claimeth heavenly protection. In this day�s battle the intervention of that God who can give victory will be singly manifested in thy favor. Let every heart, then, be the throne of confidence and courage. Thou knowest, that the enemy are strangers to religion and kindness$semicolon they are inflamed with the desire of violating the fairest sons of this land of beauty, and enriching themselves with the spoils of sacrilege and plunder. The barbarians have impiously fixed, for their struggle, to enslave us, upon the very day on which they rebelled.

Victory they shall not have! From such brave soldiers as thee, they can never wrest it. For thou fightest in defense of honor, liberty and religion - in defense of the sacred temples of the true Gods, and of thy sisters, wives and daughters. Such a holy cause must be the cause of the Gods, who will deliver thine enemies this day into thy hands. Onward, then, for thy nation and thy sacred altars!"

5804, "(fr)The Emperor has decided that he will not bear the risk of letting any of Hossel�s ships into Vasuda, so a quick decision has been made to intercept the enemy, while he is gathering his forces in Antares, and to try to take him out there.
The time of scheming and subtlety has ended, Agents. The battle of Antares is just about to begin.
Attend your briefing now, Agents."

5805, "(fr)Agents, listen carefully, there is no time to repeat anything.
This may very well become the most deciding battle since Capella.
Our main reason for fighting, is to take out the Titan.
The enemy has already assumed formation near the Beta Aquilae Node, so our initial plan of striking while they are still forming up did not work out."

5806, "(fr)Your job in this battle is to keep the Achille alive, and should the need arise, the Pharaon. Don't let yourself get distracted by the battle around you, watch out for your teammates, and get the job done.
Let me make one thing very clear, Agents: While the Achille may be our last major vessel, in this mission, the Emperors safety comes first. If the Pharaon needs assistance, you are to defend it rather than the Achille."

5807, "(fr)Pharaon"

5808, "(fr)Vasuda Jump Node"

5809, "(fr)We will hold back Beta and Gamma wing of Artemis bombers as a reserve. Should any capital ships head directly for the Achille or the Pharaon, we will launch those bombers.
Be prepared to defend them.
Good luck, Agents, if you can pull this off, you will be heroes."

5810, "(fr)Soldiers, we art pleased with thee!

Thou hast, on this day of Battle, justified all that we looked for from thy fearlessness. Thou hast adorned thy banners with an everlasting glory. The safety of Vasudan space, our own life, and a tremendous victory are the results of this day for all time renowned.

Those which escaped thy weapons are floating in emptiness. One of the most impressive ships ever built, accompanied by several major vessels, under the command of a war proven veteran, hast been, within less than half an hour, cut to pieces. This enemy, so vaunted, and in fanatism superior, could not resist thee, and henceforth thou hast no rivals from which to fear. Thus, in so short time, this rebellion has been vanquished and disbanded. Peace is now upon us. And as we promised our people before leaving Vasuda, we made only that peace, that would not see the traitor Hossel dicdating its terms!

Soldiers, when the Vasudan people placed the imperial crown upon our head, we entrusted ourself to thee to keep it forever in those rays of glory which alone make it worthy in our eyes. But at that same moment, our enemies thought to destroy and dishonor it! And this crown of iron, defended with the blood of so many Vasudans, Hossel wanted to compel us, to place it upon his filthy head!

Rash and senseless endeavor, which, upon the very anniversary of the crowning of thine Emperor, thou hast dashed and confounded. Thou hast taught further generations that it is easier to defy and to threaten us, than to defeat us!

Soldiers, now that all that is necessary to assure the happiness and prosperity of thy people hast been accomplished, we shalt bring thee back to Vasuda. There, thou wilt be the object of our most tender care. Our people shall greet thy return with joy, and it shall be enough for thee to say $quote I was at the Battle of Antares,$quote that the reply shall be, $quoteHere is a brave man$quote."

5811, "(fr)Well done
Did you notice? This victory speech is a changed version of Napoleons speech at Austerlitz $semicolon)"

5812, "(fr)You deserted, agent. You are hereby stripped of your wings pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into your desertion.

Dismissed."

5813, "(fr)Emperor Khonsu is dead. Vasuda is lost. The entire Galaxy is engaged in a civil war worse than the NTF rebellion! That was not a very impressive performance, Pilot.
Oh and did I mention that there is no longer an organization such as NeoIntel since you managed to screw up?"

5814, "(fr)Keeping your wingmates alive is the key really in this mission! You will have a very hard time defending the Pharaon alone, or taking down the Ombre for that matter."

5815, "(fr)Too bad you could not take out the Ombre fast enough to save the Achille, Agent 750. There really would have been a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel. However, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? At least you can ensure peace in some way then, pilot."

5816, "(fr)My commendation for keeping the Achille alive and kicking during the whole battle Agent 750. Thankfully you took out the Ombre fast enough to save those men. There really is a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel in times to come, and with the Achille intact, we have a power base from which we can rebuild. 
Furthermore, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? I don't think I need to tell you, how much an improvement in Terran Vasudan relations this is, do I? I wish Misraïm could see this. I bet he would vomit over it, and that alone is worth the trouble, isn't it?
Congratulations on a job well done Agent."

5935, "(fr)That sucker! He is holding back some of the best pilots in the Vasudan fleet!"

5936, "(fr)No time to argue! We are launching Beta and Gamma wings of Bombers to take on the Ombre. Alpha, waste anything in their way!"

5937, "(fr)Alpha, beware of Taurus wing, they are on an intercept course for Beta and Gamma!"

5938, "(fr)Hurry up, lads, the Ombre is heading to a position near the Titan. There will be no bringing down that ship once it gets close to the Juggernaut."

5939, "(fr)The Titan is returning to sensors at last. First Fleet�s remaining ships are launching bombers now to take out the Titan. All beams will open fire. Pharaon out."

5944, "(fr)The Pharaon has been destroyed, this is one of the darkest days in GTVA history, Pilots. Return to Vasuda."

5945, "(fr)We are losing health. Fleet, protect the Emperor."

5946, "(fr)Pharaon has lost half of its hull integrity. The Titan and its fleet must not be allowed to defeat the Emperor."

5947, "(fr)We are going critical. Saving the Emperor is our top priority!"

5948, "(fr)We have launched the Emperors personal guard now to protect us from the stealth ships, Terrans. Help them to defeat the rest of the fighters."

5949, "(fr)Leo wing is down, the Achille is safe for now. Good work."

5950, "(fr)The Hellspawn is exploding. Good work 9th Fleet. Now for the Titan�s destruction."

5951, "(fr)The Antagonist is no more. 9th Fleet, press the attack, you are to annihilate the enemy."

5952, "(fr)The Shivan Corvettes are down, we are winning on the right."

5953, "(fr)The Ikhnaton is blowing up. I repeat, 4th fleet has lost its Flagship."

5954, "(fr)NO! The Horus has been destroyed by the enemy. Revenge our kindred, brethren!"

5955, "(fr)This day has seen the Nefertiti's last deeds. Let the enemy feel your wrath my brothers!"

5956, "(fr)The Dust lives up to its name now. Bring down the rest of Hossel�s terran vessels 4th fleet!"

5957, "(fr)Slasher wing of Deimos corvettes no longer guards the Titan�s right flank!"

5958, "(fr)The Titan hath destroyed the Scion. It is our wish that they art revenged."

5959, "(fr)We have lost the Ramses. This is a dark day."

5960, "(fr)The Traitor has taken out the Gizeh. We will not forget the deaths of those martyrs."

5961, "(fr)There goes the Achille. NeoIntel just ceased to exist pilots. This was our last capital ship. I hope we at least can make their deaths count."

5962, "(fr)The bulk of 4th fleets corvettes are down."

5964, "(fr)All the Sobeks guarding the Ramses are down"

5976, "(fr)We are doing damage in penny numbers, but the Titan is starting to feel the pressure."

5977, "(fr)The Titan is heavily damaged now. Keep firing, fleet!"

5978, "(fr)Thou art winning my kindred. Blast away the Titan, for the traitor is standing at death's edge! End that petty rebellion here and now! FOR THE EMPIRE!"

5979, "(fr)The shade is disabled. Bombers waste that ship!"

5980, "(fr)Alpha, a new group of stealth fighters is heading for the Emperor�s Ship. Pharaon, Alpha needs help!"

5981, "(fr)And so it ends. The Titan is no more, we have won. Yet, another such victory and we are undone. Let us hope that this victory stops any further attempts to overthrow GTVA rule for some time!"

5982, "(fr)Alpha, you are authorized to dock in Fighterbay1. The Emperor wants to commend you and his guard on your achievements today. Not least of all: saving his life! Pharaon out."
