"

4589, "January 10th, 2371 -  Welcome Aboard

This is Admiral Richard Cole, commanding officer of the GTD Warlock, flagship of the 7th fleet.  For all you replacement pilots coming aboard, a warm welcome.

You join some of the best people in the Galactic Terran Vasudan Alliance in our crew of 10,000.  With over 120 fightercraft, the Warlock houses a total of four squadrons."

4590, "The Shivan Situation

It's been over four years since the Shivans destroyed the Capella star.  Our Great War nemesis, thought to be contained in the Gamma Draconis system, was not.  Shivan forces have been pouring into Allied systems over the last 48 hours.  We've lost the GTD Reno, the GVC Qu-eth, and the GTC Calhoun.  Command estimates losses in excess of 100,000 lives."

4591, "Allied Objectives

Allied Command has ordered the GTD Warlock and the 7th fleet to the Regulus system.  The Shivans have been executing a sustained, all out co-ordinated attack against Terran and Vasudan ships and installations.

Intelligence suspects that the Shivans are entering the Regulus system from an unknown jump node.  Both the Polaris and Sirius nodes are under close observation.  One of our objectives is to find the Shivans' point of entry."

4592, "The State of the Alliance

The Alliance, despite numerous crackdowns on pirate activity, remains unstable.  In the four years since the Second Shivan Incursion, our Alliance has been barely holding together.

We lost the majority of our fleet in Capella and have been struggling to rebuild ever since.  It is imperative that we evacuate as many civilians and military personnel as we can as quickly as possible.  We may not be able to withstand another Shivan assault."

4593, "The State of the Alliance (Continued)

The Sol Knossos project is well underway as every contractor in the Alliance contributes to its construction.  With this new threat in Regulus, Command has ordered that the activation of the Sol Knossos be suspended until the situation can be resolved.

If we fail to stop the Shivan advance, we can only hope that humanity can be safe in the Sol System."

4594, "The 332nd Black Mantas

All new pilots aboard the Warlock are being assigned to the 332nd Black Mantas.  Your squadron leader, Lt. Taine, will brief you as to your mission objectives.

All squadron leaders must attend a Quarterdeck meeting at 0930.  All squadrons are slated for duty as of 1100 hours tomorrow morning after the Warlock makes the jump to Regulus."

4595, "Welcome to the 322nd Black Mantas tactical fighter wing.  Our squadron specializes in fighter combat tactics.  We have a long history of success with our pilots and based on your current record, I think you have some great potential.  Let's move onto the briefing, shall we?"

4596, "At 1535, the GTD Warlock received a distress call from the general vicinity of the Polaris jump node.  The ship identifies itself as the GTSC Disen.  It's a science cruiser, Faustus class.  Everything checks out in our records but its mission objectives are rather sketchy.  Command has ordered a wing to check the ship out."

4604, "Good work, pilot.  I'm impressed with your abilities.

The Disen's computer database revealed little information.  What data there was has been classified on a need-to-know basis, which does suggest that whatever it was, is important.

The Shivan presence is growing in this sector.  You and your wing are a credit to the Alliance."

4605, "Command has issued no official or unofficial explanation for the GTCv Odin and it's orders.  Commodore Russik appeared to be operating under mysterious orders from someone at High Command, but that investigation and its details are way beyond my security clearance - and yours."

4606, "Command has issued no explanation for the Commodore's highly suspicious actions.  "

4607, "You have been declared AWOL, pilot!  Jumping out before you are ordered to do so is grounds for immediate imprisonment."

4609, "It is unfortunate that you were unable to accomplish your goals.  We were unable to recover any information from the GTSC Disen.  It looks like this particular mystery will remain unsolved.

I thought you were ready for this outfit.  Maybe I was wrong.  Perhaps you should go spend some more time in the training simulators.

Dismissed."

4776, "First, the last wave of transports and cruisers requires an escort.  You will cover these forces until they have jumped through the node to safety."

4777, "Second, the GTD Warlock needs escort out of the system.  The Warlock is our base and is the last remaining Allied warship in the system.  We cannot afford to lose this vessel."

4778, "We've pulled off escorts like this before, but be prepared - the Shivans will throw every last bomber they have at you and keep coming.  Keep your wits about you and make the 332nd proud!  Good luck to you all."

4779, "Well done pilots.  Admiral Cole expresses his thanks for getting the Warlock through the jump node.

We have lost Regulus to the Shivans.  Allied Command is devising a counter-offensive operation, but it appears that even holding Sirius against the Shivans may be more than we're capable of.

I've recommended your transfer to the 108th Wraiths, one of the tactical bombing squadrons onboard the Warlock.  I'm sure you'll serve them well."

4780, "Getting those last transports out was great work and certainly above and beyond the call of duty.  The people on those transports owe you their lives."

4781, "With the loss of the GTD Warlock and most of her crew, the Alliance mourns at the loss of one of its greatest capital ships.

Admiral Cole went down with the ship giving some of his fellow officers precious time to escape.  We've effectively lost the fight for our home systems.  Once the Shivans' offensive mounts, there will be no stopping them.

You are dismissed."

After a successful delaying action in Regulus, the majority of the Shivan force has only entered Sirius in the last 8 hours.  Since then, they have engaged all Allied warships in the system.

If we fail to stop the Shivans here, they will have access to most of the core Allied worlds.  Billions call Sirius home and we don't have the time to evacuate them all, despite our best efforts.

The GTVA 6th Fleet is en route to the Regulus system to reinforce Allied lines, but both the 12th Vasudan Battlegroup and the 7th Fleet have sustained heavy casualties.

Allied forces have now taken position orbiting the planet and have repelled several initial attack waves.  The Shivan destroyer Revial continues to bombard the planet.

This mission was a lot more intense than expected and you and your wingmen performed admirably.  Well done."

In addition, the crew of the GTC Nicolas extends their thanks.  While your mission objective was to protect the convoy, it is a testament to the skill and resourcefulness of you and your wing that you were able to preserve the convoy intact and come to the aid of a warship in distress.  Well done!

Tomorrow's briefing will cover the details of this new system and our objectives in it.  Until then, get some rest."

5092, "Protecting the GTC Nicolas was above and beyond the call of duty.  Well done!"

It is unfortunate that the GTC Nicolas was destroyed, but you were correct to defend the convoy and leave the Shivan corvette to our capital ships.

5146, "Beyond the Portal

We have entered the Mintaka system beyond the Regulus Knossos portal.  What we have encountered is very much like what the 3rd fleet found beyond the original Knossos portal.

The Mintaka system is made up of no less than five stars. Terran scientists were puzzled when one of these stars went supernova 700 years ago, long before than it was expected to perish. Only its core remains intact. The rest of the star became a massive nebula."

5147, "Resemblance to Capella

If we were to return to Capella the view outside would be very much the same.  Perhaps this nebula is the result of the destruction of yet another sun by the Shivan Sathanas fleet hundreds of years ago.

We are to keep on our guard.  Should a Sathanas juggernaut be sighted we have orders to destroy the portal and return to GTVA space."

5148, "The Fleet

Command has authorized the deployment of the 7th Fleet and the 12th Vasudan Battlegroup into the Mintaka nebula system.  Our objective is to remove Shivan influence and penetrate as deep into Shivan lines as possible."

5149, "Shivan Influence

Special Operations Command will be involved in an operation to determine what happened in the Sirius and Regulus systems.

Shivan forces have been retreating from most engagements, although we still face stiff resistance.

Intelligence agents are going to be conducting high priority missions to learn as much as we can about the Shivans and this is the best opportunity we've yet had.  Do not disrupt any intelligence gathering operation."

5150, "Lt. Stavros here.  Thanks to the excellent work of the Lonestars, we have now moved the Warlock into the region beyond the portal.  Similar to the system beyond the Gamma Draconis portal, this region is a nebula that is several lightyears in size."

5151, "Because our sensors are limited, we have deployed several wings from the Warlock and Tatenen to scout ahead and give us accurate information on the capabilities and numbers of the Shivans.  EM interference is not high and we expect that all internal systems will be operating at normal levels."

5156, "Good work defending the Hawkeye.  Because of your efforts, the ship will now be available for intelligence operations within the nebula."

5157, "Although the existence of Sathanas debris, compounded by the discovery of further debris, is cause for concern, Allied Command has elected not to pull out of the nebula.

The reasoning behind this decision is unknown, although it appears that somebody at very high levels wants this exploration to continue despite the risks.

Further information on the debris has been classified way beyond my level of clearance."

5158, "You have been declared AWOL, pilot!  Jumping out before you are ordered to do so is grounds for immediate imprisonment.

You've failed your objective to patrol the area ahead of the Warlock.  Another scouting party will now be required to accomplish the same tasks.  We're wasting manpower and possibly even lives cleaning up after you, pilot."

5159, "Failure to protect the AWACS has cost us dearly.  I don't suspect that Command will find it worthwhile for you to be flying with us again.  I hear that SOC aren't happy that the Hawkeye was lost, either.  They had planned to use the vessel in some classified operations within the nebula."

Admiral Russik has been deemed a traitor to the Alliance.  He wilfully fired upon GTVA craft, refused to turn over GTVA property, and may have been conspiring against the Alliance for the last 20 years.

The rest of this briefing will give all 7th Fleet personnel information previously classified which shows the true peril of the situation."

5549, "Points of Origin

The Vidar Project was the first project that the then Lieutenant Russik worked on.  It was a top secret operation being conducted by the rogue Galactic Terran Intelligence agency back in the era of the GTA.  The objective was to meld Terran and Shivan physiology into a hybrid lifeform.  The hybrids would then be used in conjunction with experimental Shivan communications technology.  We suspect several may have actually been created."

5550, "The GTE Vidar

The GTE Vidar was the only ship of its class produced.  It was designed using the hull of a Terran Explorer class ship, a very rare vessel.  The design itself is old, but we can deduce that the ship has been refitted after the defeat of the GTI.

Its exact communications capabilities are unknown.  However, it is believed that Admiral Russik integrated an ETAK device into Terran-Shivan genetic hybrids on the ship, potentially giving it an unparalleled ability to communicate with the Shivans."

5551, "Objectives

Our mission is clear.  We must hunt down Admiral Russik and capture or destroy the Vidar before it can be used.  The potential for such a technology is terrifying.

We have blockaded both jump nodes in the Kaus Borealis system and our intelligence personnel are attempting to deduce the Admiral's position.

We must accomplish our objective or we will be forced to shut down the Knossos portal in Regulus and abandon these systems.  We cannot afford the risk of allowing another rogue Admiral to collaborate with the Shivans at our doorstep."

Due to your exemplary record and your time aboard the GVD Tatenen, Command has decided that you be promoted as the squadron commander for the elite 636th Wolfpack squadron.

5557, "It is imperative that the Castigar is not destroyed.  We'd like to minimize casualties and capture Russik and his conspirators alive.  If the communications and engines are not brought down in under 3 minutes, the Castigar will be in a position to warn the Kirosi of our ambush."

5617, "Lt. Commander Niven will also be in the area and will direct your actions.  Intelligence speculates that Admiral Russik may attempt to communicate with the Shivans.  The Vidar and its Terran-Shivan hybrids coupled with integrated ETAK technology may well bridge the communications gap that Admiral Bosch sought to jump.  Monitor the situation and record everything."

5618, "Commander Niven will lead the operation.  He has orders regarding every contingency and since you'll be out of communications range until the jamming source is destroyed, you will not have direct contact with Command or a support ship.  Good luck, pilots."

5619, "Excellent work.  You and your team successfully completed an operation where most pilots would have perished.  You have more than earned your elite squadron status.  Be proud of your accomplishments."

5620, "I'm happy to report that all Shivan forces in the area were destroyed on this sortie.  This is a victory well worth noting."

5621, "You failed to destroy the Shivan communications and jamming device.

It is noted that you did find the location of the jamming device but an elite squadron such as yours is generally expected to perform better under the circumstances."

5622, "Destroy the jamming station at all costs, but avoid the blast.  Stay out of the line of sight of the Shivans to avoid being hit."

5623, "You failed to destroy all of the Shivan forces you encountered.  Your orders included the destruction of targets of opportunity.  Pilots such as yourselves should know of the serious breach in our security that has been created now that the Shivans are aware of our capabilities and presence in the system."

5756, "Pieces of the Puzzle

After hours of intelligence work aboard the GTE Vidar, we have finally uncovered Russik's plan.

Russik believes that a single Terran-Shivan hybrid holds the power to control Shivan ships.  This theory is based on the idea that Shivans are controlled by a hive mind."

5757, "Russik's Plan

Russik not only contacted the Shivans, but he gained control of a small number of their forces using the hybrids in his possession.  Intelligence  believes that a central communications nexus in the Naos system may hold the key to his power over the Shivans.  With Shivan forces under his control, he could take control of the GTVA in a mere matter of months."

5758, "The Final Attack

Our objectives are simple, if difficult.  We must prevent a takeover of the GTVA by eliminating Admiral Russik and preventing the Shivans from attacking our space.  If this means destroying him and every Shivan in Naos, so be it.

All squadrons are to report to the briefing room in 10 minutes."

5759, "This is Admiral Cole.

We've discovered Admiral Russik's location.  His transport is in close proximity to the SD Daskha, a Ravana class destroyer.  Sensor scans indicate that the destroyer is emitting a high frequency subspace pulse.  The purpose of the pulse is unknown but we suspect it is connected to Admiral Russik's control of the Shivans and broader plan."

5760, "Daskha"

5761, "We have no time to spare.  We will launch an all-out attack against Admiral Russik and any Shivans that get in our way.  Remember, we want Russik alive if possible, so consider his shuttle non-combatant.  I will personally lead the Warlock into a direct confrontation with the Daskha.  The Warlock will be doing this the old-fashioned way."

5762, "Wolfpack Squadron, you will lead the way.  Eliminate all Shivan fighters, bombers, and assist the Warlock by making surgical strikes against the hostile destroyer.  Eliminate beam cannons and maneuvering subsystems."

5763, "Gamma"

5764, "Once Shivan forces have been eliminated, we will confront Admiral Russik.  Justice is served in the courts, not in front of a firing squad.  We will bring him in alive and make him pay for his crimes against the Alliance.  We'll be with you every step of the way, pilots.  Good luck!  If we can stop the Admiral here, we can preserve the safety and security of our home systems."

5765, "Gemini 1 - Admiral Russik"

5766, "The Shivan destroyer Daskha was destroyed along with most of Admiral Russik's hope of victory in this engagement.  Well done.  Without your heroic actions disabling the cannons while under heavy fighter attack, the Warlock would not have won the day.  You are to be commended for your skill and dedication."

5767, "Admiral Russik committed suicide by self-destructing his transport.  He can no longer be brought to justice and we may never learn how far his conspiracy into the GTVA extends.  For now, we can rest a little easier knowing the fact that his plan to control the Shivans failed and that we have secured the GTVA from the threat of Shivan invasion once again.  It's finally over - for now."

5768, "The Warlock survived the engagement and is returning to the Sirius system for repairs.  I personally thank you and your squadron for defending my ship from intense enemy attack.  Well done!"

5769, "We've failed in our mission to stop Admiral Russik and save the GTVA from certain attack.  We are returning to Regulus, but our sensors are already detecting a massive Shivan buildup."

5770, "Destroy the Ravana destroyer by eliminating its forward beam cannons."

5771, "The GTD Warlock was destroyed and all 10,000 on board the vessel were lost.  The is a dark day indeed for the Alliance.  You are dismissed."

5772, "Watch for the Seraphim bombers that attack the Warlock, and disable the Daskha's beam cannons.  Ensure you dispatch the comm node quickly, and assist in the destruction of the cruisers."
