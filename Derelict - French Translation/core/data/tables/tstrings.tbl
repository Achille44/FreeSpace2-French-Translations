46, "Special Operations Command

You have volunteered for a covert assignment with Special Operations Command (SOC), in conjunction with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence (GTVI). 

Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA."

47, "Your Assignment

Missions with the Special Operations Command are carried out deep in enemy territory, with minimal logistical support. Our behind-the-lines activities include infiltration, sabotage, surgical strikes, and intelligence gathering. 

You will be working undercover within the Neo-Terran Front, leading Alpha wing of the 185th fighter squadron."

48, "Lt. Commander Snipes

Your contact in this mission is Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes, an allied officer who staged his defection to the NTF six months ago. As squadron leader of the 185th, Snipes will advise you of your mission objectives both as an NTF pilot and as an allied operative.

You will be equipped with a device that will enable you and Snipes to communicate over a secure frequency in battle. NTF ships will interpret your transmissions as targeting data."

49, "The ETAK Project

The focus of this covert operation is the NTF's ETAK project. Because access to information is restricted to the highest echelon, our knowledge here is limited. ETAK involves the development of a new, cutting-edge technology, possibly a weapon of mass destruction. 

Admiral Bosch oversees the project directly, and the rebels are constructing a prototype on the Iceni command ship. We need to get a closer look. Even a scan of the Iceni would be valuable."

50, "A Final Warning

We are working with the full cooperation of Vasudan Tactical Command and the Terran 6th Fleet. The probability that you will engage allied fighters will be minimal. However, should you come under allied attack, you have limited authorization to return fire in self-defense or to complete your mission objectives as defined by Lieutenant Commander Snipes. 

Show restraint, and use your judgement."

51, "This is Lieutenant Commander Snipes. For all you replacement pilots, welcome to the 185th. As you know, Admiral Koth's defeat in Epsilon Pegasi has opened the Polaris system to allied attack. At 1425 hours, GTVA expeditionary forces crossed our jump node blockade. The Colossus won't be far behind."

52, "Bosch isn't taking chances. We're moving the Iceni command ship to the Regulus system, where Bosch will install his provisional government. We've practiced this drill before, pilots. Alpha and Beta wing will escort the Iceni to the jump node. Delta, you're on standby."

53, "The Regulus node is located within a small asteroid field. Our job is to clear a path. Asteroids on a collision course with the Iceni will be indicated in white brackets on your HUD. That's how you know which asteroids to shoot. The gunners on the Iceni will help us out, so we shouldn't have too much trouble."

54, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is we got the Iceni and the Hinton to Regulus. The scan data you collected has been transmitted to the GTVI, and our operation to uncover the secret of ETAK continues as planned.

The bad news is we're in a lot more danger than I think you realize. The Vasudan warships were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our activities. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure has made the rebels just a little suspicious.

As usual, the GTVA is overplaying its hand. Ahmose and his subordinates now face a court martial for insubordination. The rebs are all over that one. Not only did the Admiral know the position of the Iceni, he wasn't authorized to act on that information. Our squadron will be high on the NTF's list of suspects. 

One more thing. The pilots under Ahmose's command had been informed of his renegade status before they launched their attack. Under these circumstances, we had little choice but to return fire or blow the entire operation.

Watch your back, pilot.  This ain't gonna get any easier. "

55, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is the Iceni has been destroyed along with Admiral Bosch and the ETAK project, whatever that was. 

The bad news is the allied warships that attacked the Iceni were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our operation. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure to Regulus has made the rebels just a little suspicious. Counterintel double-checked the dossiers of all new pilots and found some discrepancies in your file.

As your superior officer, it is my duty to inform you that you will be executed at 2100 hours for crimes of espionage and high treason. Sorry it had to end this way, pilot."

56, "You did not have authorization to return to base. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the NTF's objectives in this theatre. Unless Command decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Neo-Terran Front.

You will be confined to the brig pending your execution at 2100."

81, "<secure channel> That's strange. I don't know what any of this means. We'll see what our analysts come up with back home."

82, "<secure channel> Something's wrong here. Command said the Vasudans wouldn't attack until the Iceni left Polaris!"

83, "<secure channel> All right. Here are the rules. Neutralize anything that attacks the Iceni. Take out beam turrets and shoot down bombs."

84, "The Vasudans have destroyed the Hinton! Pilots, redouble your efforts! The Iceni must reach the Regulus system!"

85, "<secure channel> Either we've been double-crossed, or these Vasudans are not following orders! It's an us-or-them situation, pilot."

86, "<secure channel> If they fire on you, fire right back. If you don't defend yourself, you'll die out here, Alpha 1. These Vasudans are renegades!"

87, "Damn it, pilots! We lost the Iceni! Abort mission and return to base!"

88, "Love the Treason..."

89, "Snipes and Alpha 1 must hijack the NTT Sunder.
"

90, "As you have no doubt already heard, the GVD Psamtik has destroyed the NTD Cyrene, flagship of the Sirius fleet. As bad as things look in Polaris, the situation in Sirius is even worse. Bosch has redeployed our battle group to reinforce NTF positions in that system."

91, "We arrive in Sirius in six hours. The 185th will be deployed immediately to rendezvous with the NTT Sunder. Our mission will be to escort the transport back to the Regulus jump node. The cargo on board the Sunder has been classified well beyond my level of clearance. Let's just say if the Sunder goes down, so do we."

92, "The Alliance is fighting to secure the Alpha Centauri and Deneb jump nodes, so intelligence believes the risk of engagement will be low. Of course, that's what they told us in Polaris, where we got jumped by half the Vasudan armada. Expect the unexpected, kids, and report to the flight deck at 1310 sharp. Dismissed."

93, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The C.O. of the Sevrin has taken the brunt of Bosch's wrath for the Sunder's alleged destruction. The captain and his lieutenants have faced a summary court martial and will be executed at 0700. When you sign up for the wrong outfit, you get what you deserve.

This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. The rebs are nuts, but they're not slow. It won't take them long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence. If it looks like they're on to you, your duty as an operative of the GTVI is to escape and report everything you know to allied forces. Understood?"

94, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The destruction of the Hamaka forced our hand. The rebs are now fully aware that we're card-carrying members of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, we achieved the objectives of this covert operation. It wouldn't have taken the rebs long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence.

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. It's been an honor working with you, pilot. Good luck!"

95, "You may proceed to the next GTVI mission only if the Hamako and Sunder survive."

96, "With the destruction of the Sunder, our heist failed. With only our scan of the Iceni to go on, unraveling the secret of Bosch's ETAK project will be nearly impossible. We invested six months into this operation and came away empty-handed. 

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. Sorry your tour with the GTVI wasn't more successful, pilot. You had potential."

112, "The jamming devices should've blocked their transmissions to rebel command. But with the luck we're having, the NTF armada will arrive any second now."

113, "Mayday! Mayday! Reactor core breach on all fighters! Half the squad is down!"

114, "Command, do you copy? We've been set up! Alpha 1 and Beta 1 are traitors! We've been sabotaged!"

115, "Stand easy, pilots. We received a partial transmission reporting a reactor core breach. What happened to your squad?"

116, "We were ambushed by an allied heavy recon unit, flying some new kind of fighter. They splashed my squad and jumped before we could take them down."

117, "New kind of fighter, huh? You can tell us all about it at your debriefing. Why don't you rearm and repair, and we'll help you finish your escort."

118, "<secure channel>  Some of that transmission got through. I can't tell if they're on to us or not. Let's play their game for now. I've got some friends coming, so don't panic."

119, "Our mission, Alpha 1, is to highjack the NTT Sunder. The transport pilot is one of us, so he'll follow course. We need to make the rebels think the Sunder has been destroyed. A decoy transport will arrive in a few minutes."

120, "We've got more backup in transit, Alpha and Beta. We just need to hold down the fort a few minutes."

121, "Alpha 1, engage rebel fighters! Break to attack! Go! Go! Go!"

122, "Alpha 1, meet the 99th Skulls, Special Operations Command. The elite of the elite. Those fighters they're flying are the Erinyes class. As far anyone else knows, they don't even exist."

123, "We'll now scuttle this decoy transport. If the rebs think we destroyed the Sunder, they won't know how much we know. We'll also be able to continue our covert operation."

124, "Of course, that's if they don't hang us for failing the mission. We might be pushing our luck here, but what the hell."

125, "This is the NTCv Sevrin, 2nd Battle Group, Regulus. What is your status, pilots? We were instructed to rendezvous with a transport."

126, "Sevrin, you're late! Vasudans blasted my entire squad and two cruisers out here! You want a rendezvous? Scan that debris field! That's the Sunder right there! You're a disgrace to the NTF, Sevrin! I'm filing a report!"

127, "Stand down, Beta 1. We followed our orders to the letter. Now get back to base before the Vasudans return. There's nothing more we can do out here."

128, "You see the Hamako? That's the new AWACS ship. We're using it to block all enemy transmissions. As long as that ship remains operational, no one on the outside will know what we're up to. As far as the NTF is concerned, we're still loyal and devoted rebel pilots."

129, "So watch the Hamako, all right? If we lose the AWACS, our cover's blown for good."

130, "Keep your eye on the ball, kids. We're almost there. But if that decoy doesn't get here real soon, we'll have to bail."

131, "The Sunder is going down! All units, return to base. We blew this one big time."

132, "The NTC Mylae has jumped in. Watch the flak!"

133, "Nice shooting. The Mylae has been neutralized."

134, "Here comes the Hellespont, Aeolus-class."

135, "We've taken out the Hellespont. Well done, people."

136, "Okay, we've got the Naxos jumping in with the decoy! About time you guys made it.  Let's secure the area, and bring it on home."

137, "All right, Alpha 1. All we need to do is wait for the NTF. Hold your position."

138, "...But Hate the Traitor"

139, "Alpha 1 and the 185th attack a GTVA cargo depot.
"

140, "I'm Lieutenant Commander Jack Niven, your new squadron leader. Commander Snipes has been reassigned, so until further notice, you'll get your orders from me. With the 13th and 11th Vasudan battle groups advancing, we have a hard fight ahead of us. If we lose Sirius, our backs will be against the wall. The NTF has fought too hard to surrender now."

141, "The 4th Fleet, based in Vega, is providing the Vasudans with logistical support. They've established a cargo depot near the Alpha Centauri jump node. Recon reports a perimeter defense of 16 sentry guns, and fighter patrols inspect the depot at regular intervals. The 185th has been called in to sever that supply line. All targets are of Terran construction."

142, "Our attack will be timed between fighter patrols. Our objective is to destroy all cargo and sentry guns. Once we secure the area, we'll be in a position to ambush allied targets. The attack should lure the enemy to the depot and improve our odds in more critical engagements deeper in the system."

143, "We are lucky to get you back alive, pilot. Our deep-cover operatives stashed vital schematic data in your fighter's on board computer. With this information, GTVI analysts will be able to unravel the enigma of Bosch's ETAK project. 

These operatives also advised us of your impending execution. Unfortunately, we have no information concerning the whereabouts or status of Lieutenant Commander Snipes. We fear the odds of his survival are not favorable.

In recognition of your outstanding service to the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence and Special Operations Command, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross. With this honor, you are now one of an elite few. 

We will bring you as far as Vega, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine and continue with your next squadron assignment. Congratulations on a successful tour with the GTVI."

144, "You willfully fired upon and destroyed a civilian transport. Allied Command has expressed its shock and dismay that an allied officer would indulge in the slaughter of innocent people. 

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. "

You have been selected for a covert assignment with Special Operations Command (SOC), in conjunction with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence (GTVI). Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA."

171, "Lieutenant Commander Snipes

At 0437 reconnaissance units received a coded transmission from Lieutenant Commander Snipes. The Commander's vessel, the NTT Grall, is now adrift in a Shivan-infested region of the nebula and will not survive much longer. The Grall was docked to the NTC Alexandria when the cruiser ran our blockade of the Knossos portal in Gamma Draconis."

172, "S.O.S.

Here is part of the actual transmission.  We processed the message to enable better comprehension:

Granite Mountain, this is Black Dove requesting immediate extraction.  Engines and jump drives are inoperative.  Location, Delta 429 by 372.  Deployed Pharos beacons to assist search.  Heavy Shivan presence. Severe nebula storms.  Probability of survival not good."

173, "Allied Retreat

As you know, Allied forces are in full retreat to Gamma Draconis, so logistical support will be virtually non-existent. We have no available reinforcements and only one recovery ship. We're operating in a Shivan-infested area, so expect a fierce enemy offensive. The odds are against you on this one, pilot."

174, "You know why you're here, pilot, so let's get down to work. Recon located a Pharos navigation buoy not far from where Snipes's transmission was received. Your wing will be inserted at that position to find the Grall and make contact with Snipes. His transport has been incapacitated, and there's a high probability he's already a goner."

175, "This sector of the nebula is extremely volatile. Recon reports heavy EM interference, scrambling sensors and communications. These buoys are the only chance we have of finding Snipes and the Grall. The EM storm will make aspect lock difficult to acquire and maintain, so we recommend you loadout with Tempests and Rockeyes."

176, "Once you locate Snipes, call in Lambda 1. This is critical. Do not deploy the recovery craft until you are ready. Our transport will dock with the Grall and extract the survivors. You'll need to buy them some time as they complete this procedure. Good hunting. "

177, "Congratulations, pilot. You saved my life, and I owe you big. If I had more clout with the brass, I'd have them give you a Service Medallion, but they don't just hand those out. You didn't have to volunteer for this assignment, but I'm damn glad you did.

Now here's an important lesson. SOC didn't mount a rescue op because they liked me. They did it because I had information they needed, and information is what keeps you alive out here. Now I'm heading up the 99th for another mission, and I think we're going need you on this one. I already cleared it with Command, so it's your call, pilot. Hope you do the right thing."

178, "Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes distinguished himself as one of the best operatives ever to serve in the SOC. His courage, resourcefulness, and determination helped us defeat Admiral Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front. Snipes worked deep-cover for over six months, advising the GTVI of the enemy's movements, strategies, and capabilities. His career will stand as a shining example of service and sacrifice to the GTVA and the ideals for which the Alliance stands.

Lieutenant Commander Snipes is hereby posthumously awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the GTVA Special Operations Command. I know of no officer more worthy of such recognition."

179, "Protect the Grall as its passengers are being transferred to the recovery craft."

180, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the GTVA's objectives in this theatre. Desertion is grounds for a court martial, and you are confined to quarters pending your preliminary hearing. Until a military court decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance."

196, "Roger that, SOC. Snipes here. Much obliged. Hope you brought a transport."

197, "Call in the transport when you are ready, Alpha 1."

198, "I say again. Call in the transport when ready. We must initiate the recovery procedure ASAP."

199, "Survivors are on board, sir. Release docking point now."

200, "Extraction complete. Return to base."

201, "All units, return to base pronto!"

202, "NTT Grall, this is GTVA Special Operations Command. We are here to recover your craft. Do you copy?"

203, "You're lucky we found you, Snipes. What happened out here?"

204, "The Shivans swarmed us near Gamma Drac, so we made an emergency jump. The rest is history."

205, "How many survivors?"

206, "17 of us made it to the transport. The shockwave banged us up pretty bad. Comm and life support were all we had to work with out here."

207, "What about the nav buoys?"

208, "The Alexandria deployed them. We couldn't rely on navigation or sensors, so that was our best option."

209, "You have any information for us?"

210, "Yeah, but I classified that on a need-to-know basis. And until you get us outta here, you don't need to know. "

211, "Into the Lion's Den"

212, "Snipes leads Alpha wing of the 99th Skulls on a mission through the second Knossos portal.
"

213, "Here's the situation. Allied Command has ordered the full retreat of all GTVA forces. They've written off Gamma Draconis, so they're moving the armada into Capella to hold down the system. Meanwhile, SOC needs a unit to fly suicide to check out a second Knossos device the Vasudans found deep in the nebula."

214, "To give us a fighting chance, our unit will fly a wing of Shivan fighters SOC forces captured early in the nebula campaign. Our engineers have modified and optimized these craft. They'll handle even better than the Shivan original, and if you play it right, you might even avoid enemy detection. "

215, "We're going in with a handpicked squad. You'll fly Alpha 1. I've got Alpha 2. Two of our top pilots, Xinny and Zero, will cover Alphas 3 and 4, respectively. Our Maras will be equipped with intersystem jump drives so we can use the node."

216, "The timetable for this mission is 15 minutes. We'll jump in, gather data, hold down the fort, then jump out. Your drives will be inoperative inside a window of exactly 15 seconds. If we miss our jump, the recovery ship will leave us behind. There's no room for error."

217, "Here's something else to think about. By the time we launch, we'll be the only allied operatives left in the nebula. There'll be no reinforcement, no support, and no base to run to. That's why this mission has to be carried out by the numbers. We have fifteen minutes. No more. No less."

218, "Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. GTVA analysts are now reviewing our flight data.

Unfortunately, we failed to destroy a single one of those Shivan devices. The Alliance demands top-notch flying from its elite squads, and our performance out there was a little disappointing. At least we were able to warn the Alliance.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

219, "It is possible to destroy the Shivan device that you discovered."

220, "Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. I've advised the GTVI that multiple Juggernaut-class warships are now en route to the Capella system. We'll have our hands full getting everyone out of there alive.

By the way, nice work destroying that Shivan technology. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

For helping to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA, you are hereby awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by Special Operations Command. Congratulations.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

Great work neutralizing those Shivan devices. You delivered a top-notch performance. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

"

253, "Reconnaissance has located a Moloch-class Shivan corvette, designation $h Nosferatu, in the Gamma Draconis system. Allied forces have tangled with the $h Nosferatu before in this theater of operations, and we've lost many good pilots in the struggle."

254, "Intelligence believes the corvette was en route to reinforce the Shivan fleet near the Capella jump node. However, the vessel aborted its subspace jump before it could reach its destination, perhaps because of an engine or navigation subsystem failure."

255, "With the corvette isolated from the main Shivan force, we now have an opportunity to take it out of circulation. Your mission is to destroy the $h Nosferatu and its fighter complement. Command will commit no more than one wing for this sortie, and we have just one chance. Given your exemplary combat record, we are confident you are up to the challenge."

256, "Well done, Alpha wing. Outnumbered and outgunned, you destroyed the Nosferatu and its fighters before they could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Command will be very pleased with this outcome."

257, "Good work, Alpha. You destroyed the Nosferatu before it could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Regrettably, some of the Dragon fighters survived the assault. As you know, Dragons are among the most formidable fighters in the Shivan arsenal, and reducing their numbers is always a high priority. Nevertheless, you achieved your primary objective."

258, "Although you neutralized the Nosferatu's fighter complement, you failed to achieve your primary objective. Consequently, the Nosferatu remains a formidable threat to our forces in the Gamma Draconis system. Needless to say, Command will be disappointed with this outcome."

259, "Be sure to take along at least two bombers to destroy the Nosferatu."

260, "Command will not be pleased with your failure to destroy the Nosferatu or its fighters. You were selected for this mission because the Allied leadership had faith in your ability to perform under pressure. Unfortunately, our assessment of your skills is significantly off the mark.

Shivan battle groups continually try to gain control of this node and enter the system beyond. We cannot let them. The $f 32nd $f Battle $f Group is engaged with the Shivans on the other side of the node. Our patrol begins in 15 minutes. That is all, pilots."

275, "The Shivans have broken through to the Epsilon Pegasi system. You could have prevented this, if you had performed better. The 32nd has failed to report in.

are for every $f NTF battle group to send half its strength to the Deneb system immediately. There's an offensive planned and Bosch wants to gather forces before striking. Our group will send the three warships you helped us capture in your previous mission."

283, "The ships have been repaired and re-commissioned as the $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and the $f Vindication. I've called you here today because there's a problem. The $h GTVA has apparently gotten wind of Bosch's plans and has moved to prevent him from gathering more force."

284, "A $h GTVA battle group is now blocking our path to the Deneb jump node. Our scouts confirmed the presence of a strong force, but could not penetrate the screening cover of fighters to get an accurate ship count. "

285, "We have to go in to clear the way for our warships to reach the jump node. Since we're not sure what we'll encounter, individual assignments will be made by me once we arrive. We need to do our job no matter what's out there. The $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and $f Vindication must make it through the blockade.  Everything else is secondary."

286, "The cargo we acquired from the $h GTVA held the parts we needed to repair a few Erinyes-class fighters. You'll find them on the flight deck
when you're selecting your ships. Be ready to fly in 15 minutes."

287, "That was excellent flying, pilots! It was a tough assignment, but you came through with a great performance. Getting our warships past the GTVA blockade is a tremendous boost to NTF morale and can't help but further your career. Stand down, pilots. You've earned a good rest."

288, "No recommendation available."

289, "This mission was a complete disaster. Though it was a tough assignment, you should have done much better. Thousands of lives were lost today, and you're at least partly to blame. I'll decide later whether you'll ever fly for us again. Dismissed."

290, "Try the mission again. If you can't complete it, perhaps the difficulty setting is too high."

291, "This mission was a partial success, but we should have done much better. We should eradicate every Vasudan target that presents itself. By letting the Murakami escape, we ensured that it'll make our lives miserable another day. Next time, let's have a clean mission with no loose ends. Dismissed."

This is Admiral Petrarch, commanding officer of the GTD Aquitaine. For those squadrons joining us here in Vega, welcome aboard. 

With a complement of 150 combat spacecraft, the Aquitaine serves as flagship of the GTVA 3rd Fleet, based in the Capella system. You join an elite crew of 10,000, the finest officers and enlisted personnel serving the Alliance today."

508, "The Neo-Terran Front

After 18 months of fighting, Admiral Bosch's Neo-Terran Front has become the most significant threat to regional security since the Great War ended 32 years ago. 

The NTF demands the independence of their systems and the revocation of the Beta Aquilae Convention, or BETAC. The BETAC treaty centralized power in the GTVA as the supreme authority in Terran-Vasudan space."

509, "The Ideology of Neo-Terra

Integral to NTF ideology is Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra, a utopian society where the lost grandeur of Earth will be restored. Bosch and his followers oppose any alliance with the Vasudans as a threat to the future of the human race.

The rebels are entrenched in Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius. But before we hit these strongholds, we must secure Epsilon Pegasi, Alpha Centauri, and Deneb. These contested systems are now the focal point of allied operations."

510, "The Battle of Deneb

Allied Command has ordered the Aquitaine into the Deneb system. There we will reinforce the 13th Vasudan Battle Group, led by the GVD Psamtik. 

Both the NTF and the GTVA have sustained heavy casualties in the battle for Deneb. In the past seventy-two hours, we have lost the GVC Andromeda, the GTC Trafalgar, and over 15 fighter wings. Command anticipates the arrival of the Aquitaine and the Psamtik will shift the battle for Deneb in our favor and force the NTF to withdraw to Sirius."

511, "This is Captain Loukakis, squadron leader of the 53rd Hammerheads. At 0320 hours, the $f Aquitaine entered the Deneb system. Admiral Petrarch launched fighter and bomber wings as part of an all-out attack against $h NTF positions throughout the system. He has kept the Hammerheads on standby, until now."

512, "A situation is developing near the inhabited planet of Cygnus Prime. We have over 100,000 Vasudan refugees fleeing their colonies in transports. Allied ships are rescuing the Vasudans as quickly as possible, though the logistics of this operation leave many refugees still vulnerable to rebel attack."

513, "At 0545, we received a distress signal from a refugee convoy 900 clicks, or kilometers, from the outer orbit of Cygnus Prime. The Vasudans responded with a wing of Serapis fighters, designated Epsilon, which have just called in for reinforcements. Alpha wing, you're going in."

514, "Because these transports do not have jump drives, you must protect the convoy until a recovery ship arrives. With all warships engaged and other convoys in dire need of protection, we do not know when a craft will become available. Command will keep you updated and send in reinforcements as needed."

515, "Good work, pilot. You held off the rebel attack and saved both Vasudan transports from destruction. Your squadmates and I all agree: you'll make a fine addition to the 53rd Hammerheads. Command reports that 75 percent of the refugees have been recovered with few casualties. The remaining 25 percent are under allied protection and will be rescued shortly. We have also won major victories against the NTF.  The NTD Jacobus and the NTC Hengst have been destroyed, and our blockades of the Alpha Centauri and Sirius jump nodes has isolated the rebel fleet. Furthermore, 600,000 ground troops will soon land on the surface of Cygnus Prime in our effort to retake the planet. Prepare for your next mission, pilot. The battle for Deneb is not over yet."

516, "As officers of the GTVA, we have sworn to protect all citizens of the Alliance. The destruction of the Iota transport is unfortunate, pilot. If this were not your first sortie, I would recommend your immediate transfer out of the fighter corps. We'll give you another chance.

Command reports heavy casualties among the Vasudan refugee convoys. Only 50 percent have been recovered, and the survivors remain at great risk. 

Our efforts to drive the rebels out of Deneb have stalled. Though we destroyed the NTC Hengst, we have lost the GTC Coriolanus and the GVC Mirage. Blockade runners continue to supply the rebel fleet, and the operation to liberate Cygnus Prime has been delayed.

The Alliance remains committed to this counter-insurgency effort, though the battle for Deneb will not be won without sacrifice."

517, "Engage the rebel fighters before they reach the transports. Use your missiles to take them down quickly, and stay close to the convoy."

518, "As officers of the GTVA, we have sworn to protect all citizens of the Alliance. The destruction of both Iota transports is a travesty, pilot. You have disgraced the 53rd Hammerheads, and I will recommend your immediate discharge from the fighter corps.

The Alliance's offensive is now in shambles. Only 25 percent of the Vasudan refugees have been recovered, while the NTF continues to massacre thousands without mercy. 

Command reports we have lost the GTD Aeneas, the GTC Coriolanus, and the GVC Mirage. Our efforts to blockade the Alpha Centauri and Sirius jump nodes have failed. The Security Council will order the fleet to withdraw from Deneb and negotiate terms with the NTF."

566, "Alpha 1, your mission is to seek and destroy all targets of opportunity, including freighters, cargo, and sentry guns. $f Beta wing will scan the cargo. Recon sighted a wing of $h Lokis guarding the depot, so prioritize these bandits."

567, "Do not underestimate the importance of this mission, pilot. A depot raid won't win you any medals, but it can be just as vital as taking down a cruiser or corvette.  We must sever rebel supply lines if we want to achieve a decisive victory."

568, "Command has issued no official explanation for Admiral Bosch's presence in the Deneb system. The hidden base and the shielded cargo units only compound the mystery of the admiral's agenda. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to stop the escape of Bosch's command frigate, designated the NTF Iceni."

620, "Admiral Bosch's command frigate reached the Sirius jump node. I have received no explanation, neither on nor off the record, for what happened out there. I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis.

Good job neutralizing those fighters and freighters. You've served the 53rd Hammerheads well. Your performance in this last mission proves you have what it takes to be an ace pilot. I have recommended your transfer to the 107th Ravens. They lost many good officers in Deneb, and they could use someone with your talents. They're a top-notch unit. I know you'll make us proud.  

Good luck with your new assignment, pilot. Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will address the crew at 0630."

621, "You have successfully completed this mission."

622, "Admiral Bosch's command frigate reached the Sirius jump node. I have received no explanation, neither on nor off the record, for what happened out there. I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis.

Though you performed well under difficult circumstances, we should have destroyed that rebel freighter before it departed the system. 

You will no longer be flying with the 53rd Hammerheads. I have recommended your transfer to the 107th Ravens. Eighty percent of their unit was wiped out in Deneb, so they're desperate for new pilots.

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will address the crew at 0630."

666, "After the Shivans attack an allied warship in Capella, the 107th Ravens are deployed to secure a mysterious subspace portal in the Gamma Draconis system."

667, "Shivan Attack

To the officers and crew of the GTD Aquitaine, this is Admiral Petrarch. At 0115 hours, we received a transmission from 3rd Fleet Headquarters. A Shivan cruiser and three fighter wings ambushed and destroyed the GTC Vigilant as it patrolled the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. 

Command deployed the GTD Carthage and GVCv Dahshor. Though these vessels neutralized the immediate threat, all allied units are now in a state of enhanced vigilance."

668, "Gamma Draconis

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to spearhead the operation in Gamma Draconis as we investigate the origin and extent of this incursion.

Gamma Draconis is a remote, uninhabited system discovered shortly before the outbreak of the Great War. The system has no planets and no viable resources. The GTSC Erikson visited the system 15 years ago and reported nothing out of the ordinary."

669, "A Subspace Portal?

Recon flights in Gamma Draconis detected activity near an uncharted jump node. Closer examination has revealed this node is not a natural phenomenon but a massive subspace portal of unknown origin.  

We do not know why the Erikson failed to detect the portal when it last visited the system. This device may have been inactive and therefore invisible to long-range sensors, or it may be of recent construction."

670, "The Shivans

The Shivan vessels that destroyed the Vigilant were not of any class encountered in the Great War. The light cruiser, designated Rakshasa, and the fighters, designated Mara, have been added to your on-board database.

This is our first contact with this species in over three decades. Our objectives are clear. We must secure Gamma Draconis or face annihilation a second time."

671, "This is Lieutenant Samsa, squadron leader of the 107th Ravens. Here's the situation. The $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered Gamma Draconis at 1640. The flagship will defend the Capella node as we advance to secure the system. Recon discovered a Shivan supply depot near the subspace portal, and this will be our target."

672, "Command believes the Shivans are preparing for a more aggressive attack on Capella. The $h SC $h Behemoth, a Rakshasa-class cruiser, guards the depot with a wing of Mara fighters. Enemy freighters are entering the system, dropping their cargo, and departing through the portal. Your mission, pilot, is to execute a clean sweep of the area."

673, "Your primary target will be the Mara fighters. Once the escorts are down, destroy the $h Behemoth and any freighters in the vicinity. You'll need to hold down the fort until we deploy the $f Carthage and $f Dahshor. After you secure the area, we'll send wings Delta and Epsilon to relieve you."

674, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. The C.O.s of both the Carthage and Dahshor commend our squadron for the outstanding cover we provided. The Shivan Cain cruiser and its complement of fighters might have destroyed these vessels had we not intervened. Well done, pilot.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

675, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. Tragically, the 10,000 men and women on board the Carthage were not so lucky. As a unit, we must accept the blame for this catastrophe. Had we fought harder, we could have saved that destroyer. A service for the dead will be held at 0100 hours on Deck 36.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

676, "Stay focused on the Shivan bombers."

677, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. Tragically, the 6,000 Vasudan officers and crew on board the Dahshor were not so lucky. As a unit, we must accept the blame for this catastrophe. Had we fought harder, we could have saved that cruiser. A Vasudan service for the dead will be held at 0100 hours on Deck 36.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

678, "Over 16,000 Terrans and Vasudans perished in this engagement. That our squadron failed to stop this massacre is a disgrace. As officers and pilots of the 107th Ravens, our honor will be stained with the blood of our comrades. Had we fought harder, we could have saved the Carthage and the Dahshor."

721, "The 107th patrols the nebula beyond the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis."

722, "Research Task Force

With the Gamma Draconis system secure, a task force of Terran and Vasudan scientists is now examining the subspace portal. At this point, the scientists have ruled out the possibility the device is of Shivan origin. 

Dr. Mina Hargrove, leader of the research team, has issued a report of its preliminary findings. An excerpt of this report follows."

723, "Dr. Hargrove, Task Force Preliminary Findings (Excerpt)

The subspace portal is unlike any Shivan construction we have yet encountered. Though Shivans demonstrate considerable diversity as a species, all Shivan technology possesses certain distinctive properties. None is present in the subspace device, which means we must look elsewhere for the portal's origin. We do know that the device is very, very old, on the order of several thousand years."

724, "Subspace Vortices

The field generated by the interlocking movement of the portal's components creates a subspace vortex, connecting one part of the universe to another.  Dr. Hargrove theorizes that whoever built this device may have used it to stabilize a jump node on the verge of collapse. 

If Dr. Hargrove is correct, this technology is a tremendous discovery."

725, "A Way Home?

By constructing our own portal, we might be able to reopen the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis. Since the destruction of the Lucifer caused the node to collapse thirty-two years ago, Earth has remained isolated from the GTVA. 

We might also be able to stabilize subspace nodes that are currently too volatile for travel, thus creating routes to systems previously unexplored."

726, "Beyond the Portal

Our military operation will focus on what lies on the other side of the subspace portal. We must determine where the node leads and the extent of the Shivan presence there. Above all, we must prevent the Shivans from returning to Gamma Draconis. 

Because the portal will remain active while the research team studies the technology, our systems are vulnerable to attack.  Allied Command has deemed this an acceptable risk given the potential benefits."

727, "At 1540 hours, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis and jumped to our current position. We have entered a nebula, a vast and dense ionized field, and possibly the remnant of a supernova. We have travelled farther than any Terrans in the history of subspace travel. "

728, "The nebula has severely limited the Aquitaine's long-range sensors. We are deploying our fighter wings to explore the immediate vicinity and determine the extent of the enemy presence. Each fighter squadron will deploy a flight of four wings. "

729, "Alpha, Zeta, Iota, and Kappa will patrol a series of four waypoints. Zeta wing will lead this sortie, so follow Zeta 1 and do not stray. Be advised the nebula could interfere with your on-board systems. The ionized field will compromise your sensors, even within combat range. "

730, "You confronted an overwhelming Shivan force in a hostile environment. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you or anyone else could have done to save the Trinity and our boarding party. You were lucky to survive this sortie, pilot. 

We have heard nothing from Kappa wing since they vanished from our sensors. Unfortunately, we must presume the worst. They will be listed MIA unless we find evidence to the contrary. Our search parties have found no trace of these fighters. 

The presence of the Trinity deepens the enigma of the NTF's secret agenda. What was the Trinity doing out here, and what does Bosch know about the subspace portal? 

All patrols have uncovered an extensive Shivan force in the nebula. Command will deploy more warships through the subspace portal to assist with our mission of exploration and containment. Iota and Epsilon wings encountered two Shivan cruisers near our current location. When our reinforcements arrive, we will move against them."

744, "Hostile targets confirmed! A wing of Manticores closing fast!"

745, "I'm picking up something on sensors. I can't get a lock!"

746, "Hold on. I've got a visual on something big. A cruiser or corvette."

747, "Do you recognize the configuration? Is it a Rakshasa or a Cain?"

759, "Alpha 1, return to base."

760, "Alpha, you have your orders."

761, "Alpha, we are preparing to vacate the recovery point. Jump out now, or we'll leave you behind!"

764, "Kappa wing, this is Allied Command. Please respond."

765, "Iota wing, investigate Kappa's last waypoint. The ionized field is interfering with our transmission."

766, "Good luck, pilots. Keep a tight formation, and look out for each other. Let's all get home alive."

767, "This is Zeta 1. All clear. "

768, "Pilots, destroy those fighters, and stay alert. Watch for a flanking maneuver."

769, "No problem, Command. We'll take 'em down."

770, "Resume your patrol, pilots."

771, "There's got to be a base or destroyer in this nebula somewhere. Those fighters couldn't survive out here on their own."

772, "This nebula could be ten or twenty light years in diameter. Finding a single ship would be impossible."

773, "Unless the Shivans find us first."

774, "Do we have a status update on Kappa wing?"

775, "Negative. No word from Kappa yet. We'll find out in debriefing. "

776, "How are we supposed to get a visual confirmation? I can't see a thing in this mess!"

777, "Rather be fighting the NTF if you ask me. I never signed on for hunting Shivans."

778, "Don't kid yourself. We're the ones being hunted, pilot. "

779, "Command should shut down that portal and send the Aquitaine back to Deneb. We've got no business being out here."

780, "If Command needs your opinion, they'll promote you to admiral. Now shut up and focus."

781, "Hostile indicators on radar!"

782, "Detecting at least one wing of Manticores. Let's make this quick."

783, "There's no allied ship authorized in your vicinity. Hail them, pilot."

784, "This is Zeta wing of the 107th Ravens, GTD Aquitaine. Please identify yourself."

785, "This is Captain Arthur Roemig of the GTC Trinity. We have sustained heavy damage, and our jump drive is inoperative. We need immediate assistance."

786, "Your designation is incorrect, Roemig. Your ship defected to the NTF ten days ago. You have been stripped of your rank and citizenship in the GTVA. Surrender the Trinity or be destroyed."

787, "As captain of the NTC Trinity, I surrender on the condition you get us the hell out of here."

788, "What's your status?"

789, "We repelled a Shivan attack but engines sustained critical damage. I powered down non-essential systems so the Shivans wouldn't detect us. We've been drifting ever since."

790, "What's your assessment of the damage?"

791, "Some components were destroyed in the attack, but my chief engineer thinks a field repair is possible."

792, "We will send a damage control team with the necessary components. Transmit your diagnostics."

793, "Transmitting now."

794, "What were you doing out here, Roemig?"

795, "As a prisoner of war, my rights are protected under the Beta Aquilae Convention. I will answer no questions, Command."

796, "I thought rebels didn't recognize BETAC."

797, "No, but we do, pilot. Damage control has been deployed. They should be arriving momentarily."

798, "Trinity standing by."

799, "More hostiles incoming!"

800, "Keep the Shivans away from the Trinity, pilots. That ship won't survive another attack. Give us a time estimate, Discovery."

801, "We can jury-rig a solution in 15 minutes, Command. "

802, "Can you bring the anti-fighter turrets on line?"

803, "Negative. We need all power on engines. "

804, "We can't hold them back forever, Trinity! Hurry up with those repairs!"

805, "You need to buy us more time, pilots!"

806, "Check your distance, Alpha."

807, "Alpha 1, you're falling behind. We can't wait for stragglers."

808, "Don't stray too far, Alpha 1, or you might lose me in this soup."

809, "Use your burners to keep up, Alpha."

810, "Alpha 1, divert extra power to your engines if you need more speed."

811, "Check your formation, Alpha 1."

816, "The 107th assists the GTCv Lysander and GTCv Actium on a search-and-destroy mission in the nebula."

817, "With recent victories on the civil war front, the GTVA Security Council has authorized the deployment of two Deimos-class corvettes into the nebular theatre of operations. The $f Lysander and the $f Actium crossed the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis at 2335 hours and joined up with the $f Aquitaine's battle group."

818, "On their last sortie, $f Epsilon and $f Iota wings encountered two Shivan warships: a Rakshasa-class cruiser designated the $r Iblis and a Lilith-class cruiser designated the $r Asuras. Admiral Petrarch has instructed our corvettes to hunt down and destroy these vessels. The 107th will provide fighter cover."

819, "Alpha wing, your mission is to escort the Lysander and the Actium as they carry out this assault. Your first priority will be to eliminate all hostile fighters and bombers. Only then will you assist the corvettes with their strike against the Shivan warships.  If we lose either corvette, you will abort the mission and withdraw from the field immediately."

820, "Our primary objective was to defend those corvettes, and we as a unit failed. Our blunders resulted in thousands of casualties and the destruction of an allied corvette. This is no simulator, pilot. When we make mistakes, lives are lost. Command will have no choice but to re-evaluate our objectives in the nebula. Regardless of whether this debacle was our fault or the result of Command's miscalculation, our squadron will play the scapegoat."

821, "Monitor the hull integrity of the ships you are assigned to protect, and destroy the Shivan bombers first. Do not let the enemy lure you away from the corvettes."

822, "The Shivan warship we encountered has been designated the SD Ravana. Allied forces have been deployed to engage this vessel. 

Given the number of Shivan fighters our wings have encountered, we knew an enemy destroyer had to be lurking somewhere within the nebula. Our impaired visibility and diminished sensor range made locating their base of operations difficult. Command hoped our offensive against the two Shivan cruisers would lure the destroyer from its hiding place. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to save the corvettes from destruction. 

Admiral Petrarch has informed me that the 107th may be called in to reinforce the vessels attacking the Ravana. Suit up for your next sortie, pilot."

823, "Our primary objective was to defend those corvettes, and we as a unit failed. Our blunders resulted in thousands of casualties and the destruction of the Lysander and the Actium.

848, "No shields. No flak guns. No beam cannons."

849, "Hey, Command. You gonna tell us what the rebels are doing out here?"

Petrarch is scrambling the 107th to assist. Command will also sortie the $f GVC $f Somtus and the $f GTC $f Yakiba. Once they cross the subspace portal, we will move them into position."

869, "For this mission, we'll fly the GTB Boanerges, the Alliance's new attack bomber. The Boanerges maximizes shielding and payload, while offering enough manueverability to make it a viable tactical unit. The bomber won't handle as well as the Herc II, so stay on the move. Bombers make easy targets."

870, "With our Cyclops torpedoes, we'll have the firepower to take out the $h Ravana. If you're too far from the target, the flak guns will neutralize your bomb, so get as close as possible. Once you fire your salvo, hit your burners to get clear of the blast. The Cyclops has an extensive lock time and countdown."

871, "If we succeed, we will have secured the jump node between the nebula and Gamma Draconis. If we fail, we pave the way for a Shivan invasion of our systems. Good luck, pilot. We know you can do it."

872, "The destruction of the Ravana is the most significant victory over the Shivans since the end of the Great War. We have secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis, and we have demonstrated our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. We have proven without a doubt that we have the firepower to neutralize any Shivan threat. 

A new class of intercept fighter will be stationed on board the Aquitaine. I have recommended that you be transferred to this unit. Interceptors are fast, high-performance fighters requiring pilots with good reflexes. You've got the talent for it, and you'll represent the Ravens well.  

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will brief the crew about our upcoming operation."

873, "In the aftermath of this debacle, we are faced with the prospect of fighting an all-out war on multiple fronts. Somebody will have to take the fall for this, and it's going to be the 107th. Command has disbanded our unit and will reassign its survivors to new posts in the allied fleet. Frankly, I think we'll be lucky if they let us fly support ships. Dismissed."

874, "Monitor the hull integrity of your allied ships. It helps to disarm the Ravana early in the mission."

875, "We destroyed the Ravana and secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis. However, with our losses, this victory is Pyrrhic at best. The Delacroix, the Champion, the Khenmu, the Heisenberg, the Yakiba, and the Somtus all perished in this engagement.  

With the heavy casualties we have suffered, Admiral Petrarch will reorganize the Aquitaine's fighter squadrons. As captain of the 107th Ravens, it is my sad duty to report that after forty years of service, our unit will be disbanded. 

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system, and there we will receive our new assignments."

895, "Enif Massacre

36 hours ago, the NTF launched a full-scale offensive in Epsilon Pegasi, taking the GTVA 6th Fleet by surprise. Commanding his forces from the NTD Repulse, Rear Admiral Koth leads the rebel advance. With 75 percent of our forces in this system decimated, the regional death toll since the incursion now exceeds 80,000.
 
Unless we act quickly, a decisive rebel victory is imminent."

896, "Stalemate in Sirius

The GTD Aquitaine will lead the allied counterstrike against Koth and his warships. We will resupply in Capella before shipping out to the front. 

We have also learned our campaign in Sirius has failed. A two-pronged offensive launched from Alpha Centauri and Deneb encountered fierce resistance. Unless we can devise a military solution for dealing with the rebels, the GTVA will be forced to recognize the NTF's authority in Sirius, Regulus, and Polaris."

897, "On the Vanguard

Allied engineers in the meantime are developing and adapting technologies that will enable us to fight more effectively in the nebula. Dr. Hargrove and her research team continue to study the subspace portal. Their findings have been classified level Phi.

Until the situation in Epsilon Pegasi has been normalized, the GTVA will suspend its operations in the nebula."

898, "This is Lieutenant Commander Cordova, leader of the 242nd Suicide Kings. Welcome to Epsilon Pegasi, pilots. $f Enif $f Station, the Alliance's base of operations in this system, is now under attack. Though we have destroyed the $h NTC $h Outrage, the $h Cato continues to bombard the installation with heavy beam fire."

899, "Evacuation of civilian personnel on board $f Enif $f Station is now in progress. As you know, civilians are protected under the Beta Aquilae Convention, but the $h NTF has rejected that treaty and its provisions. Fortunately, most of the civilian convoy has jumped safely to the Capella jump node."

900, "Your mission is to defend $f Enif $f Station. As leader of Alpha wing, you will command your squadmates to destroy the fighters and warships besieging our installation. If the rebels sortie their Zeus bombers, intercept the warheads before they impact the base. "

901, "Allied forces are engaging the rebels throughout the system. As resources become available, they will be deployed to assist you. Until we get these reinforcements, however, holding down the fort is all up to you. This sortie will be the first combat field test of the Perseus intercept fighter, so let's put on a good show."

902, "When you were selected for the 242nd Suicide Kings, you were singled out as a promising candidate for a command position. The officers who recommended you had faith in your potential to make an outstanding leader. Unfortunately, this assessment seems premature, at the very least.

I am disappointed in you, pilot. Though you probably fought well as an individual, you did not use your squadmates to the best advantage in this scenario. We lost Enif Station because you were placed in a situation you were ill-equipped to handle. That's not your fault. However, if you want to fly with a top-notch unit, you must learn the difference between doing an adequate job and going above and beyond the call of duty."

903, "Destroy beam turrets on hostile warships, and intercept enemy bombers. Order your squadmates to attack or protect targets you cannot cover."

904, "In your courageous defense of Enif Station, you were eyewitness to an historic moment: the first combat deployment of the GTVA Colossus. 

You and your wing also showed us what the Perseus intercept fighter can do. Against overwhelming odds, you repelled an attack against a facility of the utmost strategic importance for the Alliance. 

The commander of Enif Station personally extends his gratitude, pilot. I can see you'll make a fine addition to the Suicide Kings.

The Alliance has won battle after battle throughout the system, crushing the NTC Rapier, the NTC Explorer, and the NTD Normandy. These victories have stalled the rebel advance, and now with the help of the Colossus, we will push them back into the Polaris system, securing Epsilon Pegasi once and for all."

937, "Verify IFF status, Command!"

938, "IFF status is friendly. Meet the Colossus, the largest space-faring warship ever constructed."

939, "This is the GTVA Colossus. Fighters stand clear of hostile warships. All batteries, fire at will."

940, "Colossus, maintain your current position. You will defend Enif Station until relieved."

941, "Into the Maelstrom "

942, "The 242nd escorts a supply convoy through a rebel-infested asteroid field as they rendezvous with the Colossus."

943, "The 242nd will escort a supply convoy as it makes its rendezvous with the $f GTVA $f Colossus. As we prepare the $f Colossus for the allied counterattack, we must handle the logistics of supplying and maintaining this warship. Convoys of transports, gas miners, and freighters have been deployed for this purpose."

944, "The $f Colossus will jump in and rendezvous with your convoy at the Capella jump node, located on the far side of an asteroid field. The area has been the site of intense fighting and rebel activity. Intelligence believes the rebels might attempt to attack our supply convoys rather than challenge the $f Colossus directly."

945, "You will be leading Alpha wing, the main escort component. Your mission is to defend the $f GTFr $f Parracombe, the $f GTG $f Avila, and the $f GVG $f Jooyun. The $f Avila and $f Jooyun are mining vessels designed to collect fuel from gas giants for the reactors that power the $f Colossus."

946, "The Vasudans have dispatched a wing of Serapis fighters to guard the $f Jooyun. You do not have command over this unit. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings are responsible for the $f Jooyun's safety. Eighteen months of civil war are beginning to strain Terran-Vasudan relations, especially in contested systems. See to it the $f Jooyun survives."

947, "Excellent job, pilot. The convoy made its rendezvous with the Colossus without losing a single ship. As the other freighters and gas miners transfer their payload to the Colossus, the Alliance is making final preparations for our attack against Admiral Koth and the NTD Repulse. A demonstration of our ultimate weapon should force the rebel leadership to reconsider their territorial ambitions.  

GTVA units throughout the system report a successful, coordinated strike against NTF targets. Command is confident the long stalemate in Epsilon Pegasi will soon come to a favorable resolution. "

948, "Admiral Petrarch and the 242nd have issued a formal apology to the Vasudans for the loss of the Jooyun. Be thankful, pilot, that we no longer live in an era in which an incident such as this could ignite an all-out war between our species. The GTVA is strong, and we have moved beyond the misunderstandings of the past. However, the destruction of an allied ship under our protection is an embarrassment to the squadron. That this happened under your leadership should give you pause. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

949, "Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you.  The bombers must be your first priority. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters.  Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

950, "Though our mission was overall a success, we lost the Parracombe. The destruction of a single freighter will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

The destruction of a single gas miner will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

952, "The NTF decimated our supply convoys, forcing Command to withdraw the Colossus and postpone our offensive against Admiral Koth and the Repulse. Your convoy lost all three vessels, a dismal failure by any measure. 

The news from the captial in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

953, "Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you. Prioritize bombers, then fighters, then turrets.  When the Maelstrom appears, you have a limited amount of time before it is within beam range of the convoy.  Use the 'K' key to target turrets. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters. Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

954, "The NTF decimated our supply convoys, with only a handful of freighters and gas miners surviving the well-orchestrated attack. Your convoy lost two out of three vessels, a failed outcome by any measure. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous.
"

955, "The survival of the Jooyun may be good news for our Vasudan allies, but the loss of the Parracombe and the Avila are nothing less than catastrophic. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

956, "By clearing out the rebel sentry guns in the asteroid field, you have significantly reduced the danger posed to future convoys on this route. Your initiative may save many lives."

957, "You destroyed the Maelstrom but failed to neutralize its forward beam turret first. Had you followed orders, you would have reduced the damage inflicted upon the convoy vessels. Though you have been granted responsibility as a wing leader, this does not privilege you to ignore Command's directives. This incident will be noted in your record."

981, "That's wishful thinking, pilot. Proceed with caution, and stay close to the convoy."

982, "Command, a rebel sentry gun has activated one thousand meters from the convoy!"

983, "Destroy it, but be careful, Alpha. The NTF seem to have an ambush in the works. Keep an eye out for hostile fighters."

991, "Feint! Parry! Riposte!"

992, "The 242nd attacks two rebel cruisers and their escorts in an attempt to lure the NTD Repulse into position.
"

993, "The Alliance will now take the $f Colossus on the offensive. We intend to break the back of the rebel fleet in Epsilon Pegasi, and the 242nd will play a pivotal role. Rear Admiral Koth is somewhere in this system. He will not commit the $h Repulse unless it's absolutely necessary. Your job is to create that necessity. "

994, "To lure Koth into our trap, the first phase of the mission will involve an attack against the rebel cruisers $h Majestic and $h Refute. They are defended by a complement of twelve Hercules-class fighters. With the speed and agility of the Perseus, you should be able to outmaneuver the Hercs and take them down."

995, "Your primary objective will be to eliminate the fighter escort. This will pave the way for the $f GTC $f Rampart and our bomber wings, which will deliver the main thrust of the strike. Our plan is to damage the rebel cruisers while presenting the smallest credible threat. "

996, "If the rebels think our force consists of nothing more than a Leviathan and a few errant bombers, they may capitalize on this advantage and sortie their fleet. For this reason, the cruisers must not be destroyed before their reinforcements enter the field of engagement. "

997, "If Koth sends in the $h Repulse to finish the job, Command will deploy the $f Colossus to strike the final blow. Your secondary objective will be to defend the $f Rampart during this phase of the battle. The cruiser will probably sustain damage from the earlier exchange. Good luck, Alpha."

998, "The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. In recognition of your contributions to the allied victory, you are hereby awarded the Epsilon Pegasi Liberation Medal. The GTVA Security Council and General Assembly extend their gratitude for your service.

Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for the 134th Barracuda squadron, a combat evaluation unit. I have forwarded your name as an outstanding candidate. The primary role of the 134th is the field testing of new technologies. In my estimation, you will excel in this challenging position.

However, I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for an extremely dangerous operation. If you choose to pursue this course, your assignment with the 134th will be waiting for you upon your return. The decision is yours, pilot."

999, "The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings have little cause to celebrate. 

The destruction of the Rampart reflects poorly on our unit and on your leadership. Command relies on our intercept squadrons to defend our warships. As a wing leader, you must learn how to take initiative, how to evaluate a crisis, and how to manage your squadmates. 

I have recommended your immediate transfer to the 134th Barracudas, a combat evaluation unit. At least the consequences of failure in such a squadron are not so grim. I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for a suicide mission. Of course, that decision is entirely up to you. "

At 2150, the Colossus entered the Polaris system and neutralized the NTD Andronicus and the NTC Camisard, securing the jump node from Epsilon Pegasi. Meanwhile, the 13th Vasudan Battle Group has destroyed the NTD Cyrene and gained foothold in Sirius. Intelligence reports that Admiral Bosch and his elite guard have withdrawn to the rebel enclave of Regulus. 

Command anticipates a total allied victory in less than 30 days."

1035, "The Subspace Portal

Dr. Hargrove's task force has determined that the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis was constructed by the Ancients, an extinct civilization discovered near the end of the Great War. Artifacts excavated in the Altair system contained data that enabled the GTA and PVN to destroy the SD Lucifer. Many Terran and Vasudan systems once belonged to the Ancients' empire, which the Shivans obliterated eight thousand years ago. The portal has been renamed Knossos, after the Earth's Minoan civilization."

1036, "The Deneb Connection

Intelligence has learned that Bosch acquired Ancient materials from an excavation site in the Deneb system. These artifacts somehow enabled Bosch to locate and activate the Knossos portal. This explains the presence of the admiral's command ship in the Deneb asteroid belt. Bosch then sent the NTC Trinity into Gamma Draconis to activate the portal, which lured the Shivans into that system. 

We do not know Bosch's motives or what the Shivans are doing in the nebula."

1037, "Nostos

Allied scientists studying the portal remain optimistic about the potential for this technology. In five to ten years, we might be able to restore contact with Earth or create new jump nodes to unexplored regions of the galaxy. For this reason, the portal must remain open for as long as possible. 

Command has issued a standing order to destroy the device should a full-scale invasion be imminent."

1038, "Our Objectives

The destruction of the Ravana has intensified Shivan activity in the nebula. The Shivan fleet appears to be smaller than the armada we defeated three decades ago, and our improved technology gives us a tactical advantage. However, with the possibility of uncharted jump nodes leading to more Shivan-infested systems, we cannot know with any certainty the full extent of the enemy force. 

A miscalculation on our part could unleash the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1039, "New Technologies

The Aquitaine will spearhead the next phase of our exploration and containment operation in the nebula. To help us achieve our objectives, the Alliance has developed new technologies, including Advanced Warning And Control Systems, or AWACS, and gas mining vessels to gather deuterium for our fusion reactors. 

Prototypes of these new tactical weapons and fighters will be deployed pending successful completion of field tests. The 134th Barracudas will be conducting these combat exercises near the Gamma Draconis jump node."

1040, "GTW ML-70 Morning Star

Two next-generation weapons are now available: the Morning Star and the EMP missile. The GTW ML-70 Morning Star improves upon the Flail gun developed during the Great War. Recent advances in high-temperature optics enable the primary focusing chamber of the Morning Star to produce a more coherent charge. Though an energy weapon, the Morning Star has a powerful kinetic effect on its target."

1041, "EMP Missile

The EMP missile interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within the blast radius of the warhead. The detonation scrambles targeting data and jams communications. Tactically, the EMP is an effective anti-bomber weapon. It prevents these craft from acquiring aspect lock and temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight."

1042, "Welcome to the 134th Barracudas, pilot. I'm Commander Vincey, your squadron leader. The 134th is a combat evaluation unit, or CEU, which means we're among the first to test new ships and weapons in the field. While we carry out our missions, engineers will gather data on the systems we've been assigned to test."

1043, "In this mission, our primary objective is to escort two Triton-class freighters, the $f Erinpura and the $f Vauban. They will enter the nebula at the Gamma Draconis node and travel to their waypoint, where they will rendezvous with the $f GTCv $f Warspite. Their cargo is the new Target Acquisition and Guidance missile system. "

1044, "The $f GTA $f Lucidity will provide AWACS support for this mission. With its powerful sensor array, the $f Lucidity will transmit targeting data to your fighter, effectively increasing your sensor range. The 134th will be the first to test the system in the nebula."

1045, "Now keep in mind that the C in CEU stands for Combat. These aren't controlled laboratory experiments. Shivan activity has intensified, so you can expect to engage some $h Maras and $h Cains out there. If the action gets too intense, call in reinforcements at your discretion. Good luck, pilot."

1046, "Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation. As we speak, analysts are reviewing the data from our flight recorders. The entire squadron has been grounded pending the conclusion of this inquiry.

Command considers this deployment of the AWACS to be a total failure."

1047, "It is essential that you concentrate your efforts on enemy bombers. You also have reinforcements at your disposal. You would be well advised to make efficient use of them."

1048, "Though we lost a freighter in this engagement, the combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios. On the other hand, your unit's failure to protect the AWACS indicates that more effective leadership may be required here."

1049, "Both the Erinpura and the Vauban survived the Shivan attack. The combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise.

Command rates the initial deployment of the AWACS a complete success. Our improved sensor capability gave us the tactical advantage we required to respond quickly and decisively to the Shivan attack. 

Prepare your wing for your next sortie, pilot. The TAG missile combat field test begins at 0315."

1051, "You have flown an excellent mission."

1052, "Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation.

The Warspite will supervise this combined arms exercise."

1084, "The 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile. This will be the first deployment of this system in an actual combat exercise. Our laboratory simulations indicate it has significant potential as a tactical weapon. "

1085, "When you hit a target with the TAG warhead, the missile's beacon will illuminate the target for allied capital ships within range. All available firepower will be brought to bear for a quick resolution. This technology could be a decisive advantage for the $f GTVA. In this exercise, we will test the prototype TAG-A."

1086, "Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your TAGs. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness. The $f Lucidity will provide AWACS coverage.  "

1089, "Though this exercise did not proceed as planned, the 134th met the challenge head-on and defended our warships admirably. 

Overall, this field deployment of the TAG missile exceeded our expectations. Research and Development is now working on improvements to the TAG-A prototype, including an aspect-seeking warhead and a more maneuverable projectile. These enhancements should make the TAG a versatile weapon for our tactical wings."

1090, "The destruction of the Warspite was a senseless tragedy. The lives of Captain Forsythe and his crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise. The 134th was called upon to get our warships out of a difficult situation, and we failed. As leader of Alpha wing, re-evaluate this scenario carefully. What could you have done to save the Warspite?"

1091, "You must make careful use of every TAG missile you are alotted.  Since they are unguided missiles you are advised to get as close to your target as possible.  Once an enemy is TAG'ed move clear quickly so you don't take friendly fire."

1108, "We are fully aware of your situation, Alpha.  We are also aware that thousands of lives on board the Warspite and Lucidity are counting on you."

1109, "Roger that, Command. We'll get the job done."

1110, "All clear. Mission complete. Alpha, you may return to base. "

1111, "A wing of five Taurvis now closing in! Intercept those bombers, Alpha!"

1112, "Iota wing here. Ready to assist."

1113, "We are fully aware of your situation, Alpha.  We are also aware of thousands of lives on board the Warspite that are counting on you."

1114, "This is the Warspite! We're under heavy fire! Alpha, unless you TAG those hostiles, we are completely defenseless!"

1115, "The Shivans have destroyed the Warspite!"

1116, "We need fighter cover on the Lucidity! We must not lose the AWACS!"

1117, "The Lucidity has been destroyed!"

1118, "Alpha, return to base on the double. This mission is over."

1119, "Mayday! Mayday! This is Kappa 3 of the 107th Ravens, GTD Aquitaine! Command, do you copy?"

1120, "Affirmative, Kappa 3! What's your status?"

1121, "Command, get the fleet out of the nebula! Shut down the portal now! There's no time to lose!"

1122, "I am transmitting the coordinates of the Aquitaine's current position. Return to base immediately. You are badly damaged."

1123, "Listen to me! There's no way we can stop them this time! Shut down the portal before it's too late! There's something out there, Command! Please! "

1124, "Kappa 3, do you copy? Please respond. I repeat. Do you copy?"

1125, "All units, you will disregard Kappa 3's transmission. The communication record of this sortie has been classified level Phi.  "

1127, "The 134th participates in a field exercise with the new Pegasus stealth fighter.
"

1128, "In this mission, the 134th will participate in a test of the new Pegasus-class stealth fighter, developed for allied operations in the nebula. The unusual design of the Pegasus minimizes the EM signature emitted by the fighter, making it all but impossible to detect with sensors. This exercise will be the first simulation of the Pegasus under combat conditions in the nebula environment."

1129, "Alpha wing, your objective is to defend the $f GTC $f Oberon, a decommissioned Fenris cruiser. The $f Oberon has served the Alliance since the Great War, and most of its systems have been stripped down to repair other cruisers in circulation. Flying the Pegasus prototypes, $h Delta wing will attack the $f Oberon. Your job is to repel their offensive."

1130, "Your weapons will be neutralized for the duration of the test. Though you may fire your lasers and missiles, they will inflict only superficial damage against $h Delta wing. Engineers on board the $f GTD $f Aquitaine will monitor the progress of the exercise and gather data to verify the stealth capability and combat potential of the Pegasus."

1131, "The Shivans destroyed the Aquitaine. Without this ship, our operations in the nebula are in jeopardy. Though we were outnumbered and outgunned, the Aquitaine went down on our watch. The 10,000 officers and crew who perished were our friends and comrades. The 134th is the disgrace of the allied fleet. 

Because we serve on the front lines, the brass think it's our duty to take the fall for their mistakes. As your squadron leader, I will testify on your behalf. More wings should have been deployed to cover the Aquitaine's retreat. However, until Command completes its inquiry, you will be stripped of your wings and held in custody. You are dismissed, pilot."

1132, "Bombers should be your highest priority when protecting the Aquitaine."

1133, "Well done, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node.  The Moloch and its fighters inflicted severe damage, and repair crews are now working to get the destroyer back on line. Nevertheless, your actions saved thousands of lives.

The 64th Raptors are in need of bomber pilots. I've recommended that you be transferred. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1134, "Excellent work, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node. For saving a capital ship of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance from imminent destruction, you are hereby awarded the Order of Galatea. Congratulations.

The 64th Raptors need a wing leader, and I think you are just the pilot for the job. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1135, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot. Your actions compromized our combat evaluation of the Pegasus stealth fighter. You have been grounded until further notice."

1136, "In order to destroy the Moloch-class corvette, you must keep it within sensor range. You are providing sensor support for the Aquitaine."

1145, "This exercise will begin in 5...4...3...2...1. Delta wing, engage stealth mode."

1146, "Aquitaine, set course for the Gamma Draconis jump node. We're pulling you out of there."

1147, "Alpha has been deployed. Delta wing, are you ready?"

1148, "Affirmative, Command. Those Alpha scrubs won't even know what hit 'em."

1149, "Alpha, we are switching your weapons to training mode. Your guns and missiles will inflict superficial damage."

1150, "With all due respect, I recommend we use live ammo for this exercise, sir."

1151, "The Oberon has jumped in and is standing by. Your objective, Alpha, is to defend this cruiser against Delta wing's attack."

1152, "Let's take these flyboys out of circulation, Delta."

1153, "Gathering test data now. All systems are functioning normally."

1154, "Here they come!"

1155, "Stay on them Alpha. Don't lose visual contact!"

1156, "Target profile is razor thin. Hard to hit at medium range."

1157, "Alpha, can you target Delta wing?"

1158, "Negative, Command. Even at point blank range my sensors pick up nothing."

1159, "Good. How are you holding up, Delta?"

1160, "Shielding and armor have a low damage threshold."

1161, "Speed and maneuverability are well above average."

1162, "Limited offensive capability. An excellent reconnaissance fighter in my estimation."

1163, "Delta wing has inflicted moderate damage against the Oberon. Stay on them, Alpha. Don't lose them in the fog."

1164, "The Oberon has sustained heavy damage. The stealth fighters are getting the best of you, Alpha."

1165, "The Oberon's hull integrity has fallen below critical. Looks like a victory for Delta wing."

1166, "That's enough for the first test, pilots. Our engineers have gathered important data. Good work attacking the Fenris, Delta. You caught Alpha wing off guard."

1167, "Excellent work, pilots. Our engineers have gathered valuable data. Good work defending the Fenris, Alpha wing."

1168, "We will now begin the second test."

1169, "Abort the exercise! Repeat! Abort the exercise! Sensors are reading incoming hostiles! Delta wing, return to the Aquitaine on the double."

1170, "Alpha wing, your primary and secondary weapons have been rearmed. Hold off the Shivans as the Aquitaine withdraws."

1171, "Roger that, Command. Engaging fusion drives. Distance from the node is 4500 meters. We will reach our jump point in 6 minutes."

1172, "This is the Aquitaine. Shivan warheads have impacted our hull. We are sustaining heavy damage from the Moloch's main gun."

1173, "This is the Aquitaine. All hands prepare to abandon ship! Probability of hull failure is high!"

1174, "The Aquitaine has been destroyed! Abort mission, pilots! Get out of there now!"

1175, "The Aquitaine has reached the Gamma Draconis jump node! Secure the area and return to base, pilots. Well done."

1179, "The 64th Raptors lead a bombing action against NTF ships running the blockade of the Capella jump node.
"

1180, "Bosch's Gambit

We have received news of an alarming development on the civil war front. Massing his forces in the Regulus system, Admiral Bosch outmaneuvered the Colossus and its battle group. The rebel armada is now en route for the Gamma Draconis system, via Polaris, Epsilon Pegasi, and Capella. 

Their final destination: the Knossos subspace portal."

1181, "Running the Gauntlet

Allied forces destroyed a number of NTF warships as they ran our gauntlet of jump node blockades. However, the rebels have sufficient firepower to threaten our positions in Gamma Draconis. 

The Colossus and its battle group are in close pursuit, neutralizing enemy stragglers. We must hold Gamma Draconis until these reinforcements arrive."

1182, "On the Barricades

Our squadrons will assist with the blockade of the Capella node. As the rebels begin their incursion, our objective will be to inflict as much damage as possible. The second phase will involve a counterstrike against enemy rallying positions, where the rebels will gather to coordinate their final attack. 

We must diminish the NTF's offensive capability before our confrontation at the node."

1183, "Rebellion's End

This campaign may prove to be the admiral's final gambit. Whether or not Bosch reaches the portal, the NTF regime and its domination of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are effectively over. Command has disclosed neither the motives behind Bosch's actions nor the consequences should the admiral succeed. 

We do know that 18 months of carnage and terror will soon come to an end."

1184, "Artemis Bomber

The Aquitaine has just received four wings of the new GTB Artemis, the Alliance's next-generation light bomber. The most agile ship of its class, the Artemis will carry the Cyclops torpedo, our modified anti-cruiser warhead. I have reassigned pilots to the 64th Raptors. This squadron will play a bomber and heavy assault role in the upcoming operation."

1185, "Prometheus S

The Artemis will be armed with the new Prometheus cannon. Our nebula gas miners have gathered sufficient resources to resume production of the GTW-5 Prometheus S. The S-type is based on the original design of the Prometheus cannon. With high marks for shield and hull damage, the Prometheus was our weapon of choice in the Great War."

1186, "This is Commander Beckett, leader of the 64th Raptors Bomber Squadron. At 0457, NTF warships entered the Gamma Draconis system and engaged our blockade. So far we've taken down the NTC Absalon, the NTC Cunaxa, and several troop transports.  Admiral Petrarch has called in the 64th to assist."

1187, "The Vasudans are leading the blockade with the $f GVD $f Hedetet, a Typhon-class destroyer. The Alliance has also set up a network of five $f Mjolnir RBCs, or Remote Beam Cannons. These unmanned experimental weapon platforms discharge anti-warship beams to complement the defense of a strategic target."

1188, "The $h NTF fleet will enter through the Capella jump node. Each warship will then jump to a rallying point within the Gamma Draconis system. In the interval between jumps, they will re-energize their subspace drives. Your role will be to neutralize the warships with your Cyclops torpedoes."

1189, "The $h Iceni has already slipped through our defenses, but we will make every effort to track Bosch down before the rebels rally their forces and attack. According to Intelligence, the $h NTD $h Uhuru, the $h NTC $h Pax, the $h NTC $h Liberty, and the $h NTC $h Undaunted have entered the subspace node and are heading for the blockade."

1190, "The 64th Raptors are the disgrace of the Aquitaine and the GTVA. Every warship that ran our blockade threatens our positions in the Gamma Draconis system. Though we have the strength to crush the rebellion, our failure here will cost lives and resources we should not have to sacrifice.  

Admiral Petrarch has grounded the 64th until further notice. Our bombers will be reassigned to the 107th Ravens. Dismissed, pilot."

1191, "Coordinate your squadmates to attack the critical targets."

1192, "Excellent work, pilot. With our blockade of the Capella jump node, the Alliance has achieved a major victory. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th negated a significant component of the rebel fleet. The Raptors neutralized all hostile warships that crossed our lines. No other squadron can make that claim.

Our unit will be redeployed ASAP. Report to the ready room on the double."

1193, "Good work, pilot. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th reduced the offensive capability of the NTF fleet. Our chances of minimizing allied casualties in Gamma Draconis have improved significantly.

1203, "Good work, pilots! Don't smoke 'em yet. We've got more trouble on the way."

1204, "The NTD Uhuru has jumped! Now en route to rallying position."

1205, "Alpha 1, a Deimos-class corvette, the NTCv Pax, has entered the system."

1206, "The Pax is going down!"

1207, "The Pax has escaped! This is a blockade, pilots! We've got to shut the rebels down!"

1208, "The NTC Liberty now entering the system. Aeolus-class cruiser. Evade the Loki escort, Alpha!"

1209, "That's a confirmed kill! We've got more hostiles jumping in!"

1210, "Heads up, Alpha! The NTC Undaunted, a Leviathan-class cruiser, has entered the fray."

1211, "Stay focused, Alpha. The battle's not over yet."

1212, "The Undaunted has jumped out. Every ship that gets away means trouble later, pilots!"

1215, "Inspiration objective neutralized! Stand clear of the blast!"

1216, "The Inspiration has run the blockade!"

1217, "The NTCv Perseverance has cleared the node!"

1218, "The Perseverance is no more! That's what you flyboys get paid for!"

1219, "The Perseverance has made the jump. That's gonna cost us big, pilots."

"

1223, "Reconnaissance has located one of the $h NTF's rallying points within the Gamma Draconis system. The rebels are preparing to execute a coordinated strike to acquire control of the Knossos subspace portal. Intelligence believes the $h NTF has sufficient firepower to mount a credible offensive."

1224, "Your primary target is the $h Iceni, Bosch's command ship. The 64th Raptors will lead the strike. The Vasudans will sortie the $f GVC $f Hyksos and a wing of Serapis fighters to assist. We will deploy additional forces as they become available."

1225, "You are now authorized to carry the GTM-10 Piranhas. A third-generation version of the Synaptic bomb, the Piranha provides a high-explosive anti-fighter screen. Trigger the Piranha's detonation by pressing your launch button a second time."

1226, "You faced down fierce resistance and damaged the rebel fleet. The NTF has commenced its attack on the Knossos subspace portal, but the efforts of our squadron have significantly reduced their offensive capability. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also achieved major victories, though Admiral Bosch remains at large. This is the beginning of the end for the NTF."

1227, "Our inability to inflict significant damage against the rebel warships may compromise our defense of the Knossos subspace portal. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also failed to achieve decisive results. Though the Neo-Terran Front remains on the brink of collapse, we cannot afford to underestimate Bosch and his followers."

1228, "Coordinate your efforts with your squadmates. Keep them focused on critical targets."

1229, "We mourn the loss of our ships and crew. Many lives were lost in this battle that perhaps could have been saved had we been more vigilant. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, but this victory should not come at such a high price. The end of the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance. We have the Shivans to contend with, and for that battle, we will need every warship in the armada."

1230, "Use your squadmates to protect friendly craft."

1231, "Command is pleased we have succeeded in minimizing allied casualties throughout this operation. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, though a victory in the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance. We still have the Shivans to contend with, and for that battle, we will need every warship in the armada."

1240, "What's the situation, Beta?"

1241, "Either recon screwed up or Bosch jumped already."

1242, "Should we abort our attack, Command?"

1247, "Negative, pilots. Destroy the Vindicator. Neutralize any rebel ship that reaches the rallying point. We'll intercept Bosch at the portal."

1248, "Command, we need more firepower here!"

1249, "We are deploying Delta wing and the GTC Diomedes to assist. Please stand by."

1250, "This is the Diomedes. Engaging the rebels now."

1260, "Endgame"

1261, "The 64th must intercept a rebel attack at the Knossos subspace portal."

1262, "The $h NTF has attacked our warships defending the Knossos. We repelled their first offensive, but the $h NTC $h Alexandria reached the portal and made the jump into the nebula. We believe the rebels are regrouping to launch a second assault. Command has positioned the $f GTA $f Monitor to hold off the attack, and reinforcements are on their way."

1263, "The 64th will play a fighter role in this mission. The $h NTF have a few Zeus and Medusa wings remaining, so your objective will be to engage all rebel bombers and neutralize their fighter escort. The $f Colossus has engaged the $h NTC $h Vanguard and the $h NTCv $h Congreve. We will move the $f Colossus into position as soon as this battle has been resolved."

1264, "Keep an eye out for the $h NTF $h Iceni. If this vessel emerges within range, you are authorized to engage and destroy it. Bosch has eluded our forces since he entered the Gamma Draconis system. Though we anticipate Bosch will either attempt to gain control of the Knossos or enter the portal itself, be prepared for any development."

1265, "This is the endgame, pilot. Bosch's $h Neo-Terran $h Front has been crushed.  Only the die-hard fanatics remain. They'll fight to the death and take as many of us with them as they can. We have every confidence in your ability to get the job done. Good luck."

1266, "The Aquitaine now has available the GTM-4a Tornado, a modified version of the Hornet missile. With improved fire control systems and guidance computers, the Tornado can fire more often and with greater accuracy than the Hornet. Be advised the Tornado will fail to arm its ordnance properly if aspect lock has not been achieved."

1267, "You are also authorized to carry the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. The Infyrno is a remote detonation missile. Hit your secondary trigger a second time to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the warhead's distance.  The Infyrno will release multiple submunitions with ultra-high explosive charges."

1268, "The Alliance charged the 64th Raptors with the duty of defending the Monitor, the Fortune, and the thousands of lives on board these warships. We failed our mission. Though these officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA, there is no hero's welcome for our squadron. Our job was to get these men and women home alive.

I am recommending your immediate transfer out of this unit. The Admiral and I believe you might be better suited to pilot a support ship, a freighter, or maybe a transport. A tactical squadron is no place for officers who cannot get the job done. There's too much at stake here."

1269, "Bombers should be your highest priority."

1270, "The Alliance mourns the loss of the GTC Monitor. Thousands of courageous officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA. We as a squadron must ask ourselves what could have been done to avert this tragedy.

Aken Bosch has eluded capture once again. Jumping in near the Knossos was a risky maneuver, but it enabled him to reach the nebula. Rebel saboteurs on board the Colossus temporarily shut down fire control to give the Iceni a window of opportunity. These operatives are now in custody.

You have been reassigned. Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for pilots to participate in an officer exchange program with the Vasudans. The Admiral and I believe a tour of duty with Vasudan Tactical Command may do you some good."

This is Admiral Khafre, commanding officer of the GVD Psamtik, 13th Vasudan Battle Group.

The NTF rebellion is over. Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are now under allied control, and we begin the process of rebuilding these systems after 18 months of bloodshed. NTF officers responsible for the genocide of Vasudan civilians will face a war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. GTVA warships in the nebula are now hunting down the Iceni and the other blockade runners."

1309, "Welcome, Terrans

For those Terran pilots joining us in Gamma Draconis, welcome aboard. Your reassignment is part of an officer exchange program to foster better cooperation and understanding. You will serve in Vasudan wings and pilot Vasudan fighters. Our crews have modified our craft to accommodate Terran pilots.

We as an alliance have come a long way since the Terran-Vasudan War, and initiatives such as this can only strengthen the bond between our species."

1310, "The Second Front

With the rebellion defeated, we are now able to focus on our exploration and containment operation in the nebula.

We begin launching our squadrons at 3230, Vasudan Galactic Time."

The Psamtik has received a shipment of the new GTW-66 Maxim Gun.

You have also been issued the GTW-83 Lamprey Cannon. A second-generation Leech gun, the Lamprey affects the energy systems of your target, draining its weapon, shield, and afterburner reserves. Coupled with a balanced hull and shield damaging weapon, the Lamprey is highly effective against smaller vessels."

1313, "Mekhu HL-7

All Terrans be advised that Vasudan fighters and bombers may be equipped with the Mekhu HL-7. A modified version of the Subach HL-7, the Mekhu design has been optimized for the reactor grids of Vasudan craft to increase the cannon's rate of fire."

1314, "Welcome to the 203rd, Terran. I am Commander Habu, squadron leader. Our unit has served the Emperor since the war between our species, nearly five decades ago. I understand you were among the pilots who assisted our counter-insurgency effort in the Deneb system. We are honored to fight by your side, pilot. You will lead Alpha wing."

1315, "Allied Command has ordered the 203rd to nullify a gas mining operation in the vicinity of our secured perimeter. Reconnaissance has located six $h Rahu-class miners, defended by a screen of sentry guns. Your primary objective is to destroy the miners. Your secondary objective is to neutralize the sentry guns."

1316, "Be advised the shockwave of a gas miner explosion will have a destructive radius greater than that of a ship of comparable size. As the hull integrity of your target approaches zero, put as much distance as possible between yourself and the miner. We believe the Shivans are using the nebular gas for energy. Good luck."

1317, "Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

If our preliminary assessment is correct, the Shivans are preparing a full-scale incursion. However, the Sathanas could pose a much greater threat than the Lucifer superdestroyer of the Great War. Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

You performed well in this mission, Terran. Though we damaged their gas-mining operation, we now have greater concerns to attend to."

1318, "A Vasudan never leaves the field of battle without authorization from a superior officer. Your cowardice jeopardized the lives of our brothers and sisters. You are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance. You will be taken into custody and handed over to the Terran 3rd Battle Group authority, where you will face a court martial. You are a disgrace to your species, Terran."

1319, "Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

If our preliminary assessment is correct, the Shivans are preparing a full-scale incursion. However, the Sathanas could pose a much greater threat than the Lucifer superdestroyer of the Great War. Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

Your valor and skill are formidable, Terran. Your commanders spoke very highly of you, and we see now their praise was not exaggerated. You risked your life above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill your objectives, regardless of the danger.  We'll make a Vasudan of you yet."

1325, "All units, return to base! We do not have the firepower to challenge that warship!"

1326, "Attention, all units. Long-range scanners detect a defensive perimeter of six sentry guns and a wing of Mara-class fighters, designation Virgo. Proceed with caution."

1333, "This is the Tatenen. Shivan bombers have engaged! Request immediate fighter cover!"

1334, "Good work, pilot. Their operation has been compromised fifty percent. Continue with your mission."

1335, "The GVA Junit will provide AWACS support."

1336, "One Belial-class sentry gun neutralized. Five more guard the perimeter."

1337, "We have negated three of six guns in the perimeter."

1338, "Perimeter objective neutralized. All guns are down."

1339, "We have destroyed one Rahu-class miner. Five remain. Seek and destroy."

1340, "Disengage now, Tatenen! Break off and retreat! We're pulling you out!"

1341, "All units, defend the Tatenen! We'll resume our attack once we eliminate this threat. Intercept and destroy!"

1342, "All units, we are picking up an unusual jump signature in your immediate vicinity.  Seek and identify."

1343, "A Monster in the Mist"

1344, "Flying the Ptah stealth fighter, Alpha 1 of the 203rd must scan the subsystems of the Sathanas.
"

1345, "Alpha 1, you will pilot the new Ptah-class stealth fighter. Your mission is to scan the subsystems of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. Allied Intelligence has requested data regarding the navigation, weapons, sensors, and communications subsystems of the warship."

1346, "To scan a subsystem, you must first select it with the subsystem targeting control. Then close to 150 meters to scan. The lead indicator must be in the center of your reticle. Maintain that position until the scan indicator has moved across your target view. Average scanning time is five seconds."

1347, "The design of the stealth fighter will minimize your EM signature, though we have not tested the stealth fighter against Shivan targets. Avoid flying into the line of sight of enemy fighters, and keep moving as much as possible. The longer you stay in one position, the greater your risk of detection. Firing weapons will also reveal your position."

1348, "To create a diversion, the $f GVCv $f Maahes will direct an assault toward the stern of the warship. This will draw enemy fire away from you and the systems you must target. The $h Sathanas has a smaller concentration of turrets in this quadrant, but you must complete your mission quickly. The corvette will not last long against the Juggernaut."

1349, "Very impressive, Terran. Though Vasudan Tactical Command had its doubts, our deployment of the Ptah-class stealth fighter was successful. Against difficult odds, you acquired subsystem scans of the Shivan Juggernaut. 

GTVI analysts are now reviewing the data, searching for a weakness in the Juggernaut's defenses. Once Intelligence completes its report, Allied Command will outline our strategy for neutralizing the Sathanas threat."

1350, "The operation did not proceed as smoothly as we had anticipated. However, you survived a difficult engagement and scanned 3 of the 4 subsystems. Though we are lacking 25% of the requested data, our analysts assure us your performance was satisfactory, under the circumstances. Perhaps a Vasudan pilot would have been more successful, given the unusual design of our stealth fighter."

1351, "The mission did not proceed as smoothly as we planned. With data acquired for only 2 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1352, "This mission was a complete failure. With data acquired for only 1 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1353, "This mission was a disaster, pilot. You failed to scan any of the Juggernaut's subsystems, and our analysts have no information to plan a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1354, "The Sathanas vaporized the Maahes, killing all on board. Perhaps if you had completed your objectives in a more timely fashion, this tragedy might have been averted. Of course, Command must accept its share of the blame for failing to assess the status of the engagement."

1355, "Your attack against the turrets of the Sathanas has yielded important data regarding the relative strength of the Juggernaut's weapons. This information should prove useful."

1356, "For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of your own life, you are hereby awarded the Medal of Valor."

1366, "The subsystem's lead indicator must also be in your reticle. The average scanning time is five seconds. If the scan cycle is aborted, you will have to make another attempt."

1367, "The Maahes has already engaged the Sathanas. You'll have to move quickly."

1368, "This is the Maahes. We have sustained damage from the juggernaut's cannons. We cannot distract the Shivan force indefinitely."

1369, "Hang in there, Maahes. We need more time. Alpha 1, let's get a move on!"

1370, "Command, this is the Maahes. Our hull cannot withstand another salvo. We must withdraw immediately."

1371, "Acknowledged, Maahes. We're pulling you out. Alpha 1, you're on your own."

1380, "Excellent. One last subsystem to scan."

1381, "Mission accomplished, Alpha 1."

1382, "You may return to base, or you may perform one more task."

1383, "Destroy as many turrets as you can. Intelligence has requested data on the strength of the warship's armaments."

1384, "However, be advised you may return to base at any time."

1385, "The Sathanas has departed. Return to base, pilot."

1386, "Speaking in Tongues"

1387, "The 203rd attacks a Shivan warship in an attempt to lure the Sathanas into position."

1388, "Your reconnaissance of the $h Sathanas identified weak points in the Juggernaut's defenses. However, exploiting these weaknesses will require firepower that can be provided only by the main guns of our capital ships. The $f GVD $f Psamtik, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine, and the $f GVD $f Toeris are standing by. Your mission is to lure the $h Sathanas into position."

1389, "In the first phase, you will attack the $h SC $h Rephaim, a Rakshasa-class warship. Our recon flights have located the $h Rephaim near the allied secure zone. The cruiser is accompanied by two wings comprised of Mara-class fighters. Our analysis of the $h Rephaim's flight pattern suggests the vessel is patrolling the region."

1390, "Your first task is to eliminate the fighter escort. This must be achieved quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Once the escort has been neutralized, call in Delta wing. The bombers will help you destroy the $h Rephaim. If necessary, your wing will need to incapacitate the cruiser's beam turrets to clear a path for your bombers."

1391, "We anticipate the attack on the $h Rephaim will bring Shivan reinforcements.  Your squadron is charged with the duty of engaging and destroying these hostiles until the $h Sathanas arrives. Sigma wing will also be available to assist, once these bombers have returned from their current sortie."

1392, "The upgraded Target Acquisition and Guidance warhead is now available. The TAG-B, an aspect-seeking missile, features an improved shock-resistant substrate that enables the beacon to transmit data with greater precision.  The $f GVCv $f Sopedu will provide fire support for this operation."

1393, "The Alliance will execute simultaneous, coordinated strikes against Shivan positions in the nebula. For this reason, our destroyers will not be deployed unless the $h Sathanas appears in your field of engagement.  If we fail to lure the $h Sathanas, or if the Juggernaut engages our forces elsewhere, we will abort this mission."

1394, "At 0745 hours, reconnaissance sighted the Sathanas juggernaut heading for the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. Because of the immediate risk to our home systems, Command has aborted the plan to attack the juggernaut in the nebula. All allied forces have been ordered to withdraw immediately to Gamma Draconis. Further orders will be issued upon our arrival. We have no conclusive data regarding the transmissions exchanged between the Iceni and the Rephaim."

1405, "That's impossible! This is an allied channel!"

1406, "Confirmed. We are receiving a transmission from the Shivan warship!"

1407, "Command, I have targeted the Iceni! The rebel command ship is in the field of engagement."

1408, "All units, engage the Shivans! Stand clear of the Iceni! Do not attack that ship!"

1409, "Acknowledged, Command. We will not engage the Iceni."

1410, "The Iceni has activated its subspace drive!"

1411, "Now deploying the Thutmose!"

1412, "We have destroyed the Rephaim! Excellent work, pilots."

1420, "Shivan reinforcements could arrive at any time. Rearm if you need to, pilots."

1421, "No sign of the Sathanas! We must keep up this offensive to lure the Shivan juggernaut!"

1422, "Delta wing is standing by. Call in the bombers at your discretion, Alpha."

1423, "Sigma wing is now standing by. Deploy these bombers at your discretion."

1424, "All units! Return to base! The Shivan juggernaut is heading for the Gamma Draconis node!"

1425, "Alpha 1, you are disobeying a direct order! Command is withdrawing the fleet to Gamma Draconis. If you do not jump out now, you'll be left behind."

1426, "You'll pay for your insubordination, pilot. Allied Command, out."

1427, "A Flaming Sword"

1428, "As a last resort, the GTVA demolishes the Knossos subspace device in Gamma Draconis.
"

1429, "Sathanas

The Shivan juggernaut Sathanas is now en route to the jump node leading to Terran-Vasudan space. Command ordered all units to rally in Gamma Draconis in three hours' time. Though we have accounted for most of our fleet, at least six warships have failed to reach the rendezvous point. We can wait for them no longer.  The GTVA Security Council has authorized the immediate destruction of the Knossos subspace portal."

1430, "Meson Bomb

To demolish the Knossos portal, we will detonate the meson bomb, an experimental new weapon under development at the Hideki Institute in the Vega system. Though its specifications are highly classifed, physicists claim the meson bomb has more explosive power than any other warhead in our arsenal, sufficient to destroy any small craft within a three-kilometer radius. The size of the bomb prohibits tactical deployment."

1431, "Allied Strategy

A small task force will oversee the demolition of the Knossos while the bulk of the allied fleet blockades the jump node leading to the densely-populated Capella system. Command has begun the process of evacuating the two hundred fifty million civilians inhabiting Capella, the largest exodus since the Great War. The Colossus will remain in that system to engage the Sathanas should we fail."

1432, "At 2230 hours, the $f GTVA announced its plan for the destruction of the Knossos device. For strategic and scientific reasons, we will not attack the portal with the main guns of our warships. The demolition of the subspace portal will be accomplished with the use of the experimental Meson bomb."

1433, "Our first objective will be to sanitize the area. Observers report that Shivan scouting wings have already entered Gamma Draconis, and enemy activity will intensify before the arrival of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. The $f Renenet, a Sobek-class corvette, will monitor the operation and provide fire support."

1434, "Once we have eliminated the enemy presence, a freighter carrying the Meson warhead will deposit the bomb at the detonation site. This is the first deployment of the weapon prototype. Because computer simulations predict only a forty percent chance of success, we have two more warheads standing by."

1435, "We demolished the portal but to no avail.  The subspace vortex generated by the Knossos device has stabilized, and the Sathanas entered the Gamma Draconis system. Our forces are standing by to intercept the juggernaut at the Capella jump node.

We do not know how long the nebula jump node will remain open. In theory, it could be centuries before it collapses again. Scientists assure us that we have gathered sufficient data to reconstruct the Knossos, but a project of that magnitude would take decades to complete.
"

1436, "We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to avert this catastrophe."

1437, "Nevertheless, your tenacity is impressive. You eliminated all Shivan fighters. You are a credit to your species. Vasudan Tactical Command has taken note of your performance."

1438, "The destruction of the freighter was unacceptable, Terran. You have sufficient combat experience to understand that freighters and transports are vulnerable targets, and they require fighter support in hostile environments. In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1439, "It is not enough to attack targets of opportunity.  You must single out those that threaten your objectives and deal with them, either through direct action or by ordering your squadmates to do so."

1440, "We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board.  In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1449, "There's no time to wait. Alpha, close in and draw the fighters away from the Knossos. Lure them toward the Renenet. We need to clear that detonation site before we sortie the freighter. "

1450, "Acknowledged. We will lure them within range of the corvette's guns."

1451, "Command, we have engaged the enemy. We are now heading back to the Renenet."

1452, "Command, we achieved a clean detonation of the meson warhead. However, the Knossos portal remains fully operational. "

1453, "We will proceed with the second deployment. Demolition pattern sigma. We will use the remaining meson bombs for this attempt. The Sathanas juggernaut cannot be far away. "

1472, "Particularly a weapon of Terran design."

1473, "The meson bomb is a joint development, Alpha 4. We are full partners in this enterprise."

1474, "Alpha wing, you would be well advised to concern yourself with the Shivans and leave these matters to the Security Council."

1475, "The Shivans have accepted your challenge, Alpha wing. Head back to the Renenet. Our turrets will open fire when the enemy comes within range."

1476, "Initiating detonation sequence. All units, stand clear of the blast zone."

1477, "Alpha, your vessel must be no less than 3,000 meters from the center of the portal."

1482, "Command, demolition pattern sigma has proven successful. The Knossos subspace portal has been destroyed."

1483, "Congratulations, Renenet. You just saved millions of lives out there. You'll get a hero's welcome back at the fleet. "

1484, "With all due respect, Command. This is no time for celebration. The destruction of this ancient artifact is an immeasurable loss. "

1485, "Our scientists have all the data we need to rebuild the portal in the future, Renenet. We just stopped the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1486, "Command, I'm picking up an incoming jump signature! The Sathanas is entering the system!"

1487, "That's impossible! Request immediate status update!"

1488, "The jump node between Gamma Draconis and the nebula has stabilized. Our destruction of the Knossos had no effect."

You will be armed with the new long-range Trebuchet missile and the Helios torpedo, the $f GTVA's most powerful tactical warhead."

1497, "Your wing destroyed the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. The tactical significance of this achievement cannot be over-emphasized. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus. "

1498, "Your performance was outstanding."

1499, "Your wing destroyed three of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is superb. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1500, "Your performance was excellent."

1501, "Your wing destroyed two of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is adequate.  Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1502, "You have performed well. The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1503, "You destroyed only one of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons, pilot. You faced overwhelming odds, but they were not insurmountable. The Sathanas poses a dire threat, not only to the Colossus but to all systems of the GTVA. We are on the threshold of a second Shivan invasion, and we have limited resources to wage this war. "

1504, "The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1534, "Neither will the Colossus if you fail your mission! You have your orders! Do it now!"

1535, "Delta wing, disable the forward flak guns or we'll be ripped to shreds. Alpha, focus on the main cannons."

1536, "Acknowledged. Targeting flak guns now."

1537, "Well done, Alpha. The Thebes will be in system momentarily to secure the node. Rearm and repair quickly. More enemy warships are inbound. Gamma wing deployed."

1538, "The Shivans will attempt to consolidate their gains in Gamma Draconis. We must hold them off at all costs. Failure is not an option here."

1539, "This is the Thebes. We have emerged within a large debris field, Command. "

1540, "Alpha wing just resolved a tactical engagement, Thebes. Recon has sited a Demon-class destroyer, designation Beleth. The warship will be upon us momentarily."

1541, "Alpha and Gamma, you will be tasked with destroying the Demon's beam cannons. The Thebes will provide fire support. Reinforcements are standing by."

1542, "A Demon-class destroyer has jumped in. Command is well-informed."

1543, "Then they must know this mission is suicide."

1544, "Your performance was less than satisfactory, pilot. The Thebes will be in system momentarily to secure the node. Rearm and repair quickly. More enemy warships are inbound. Gamma wing deployed."

1545, "Excellent work, pilots. We have destroyed the Beleth. Secure the area and return to base. We need you in the Capella system."

1546, "Excellent work, pilots. Return to base pronto. We need you in the Capella system."

1547, "Good work."

1548, "Return to base, pilots. We need you to assist the Colossus in the Capella system."

1549, "The Phoenicia will hold back the Sathanas until you complete your objectives."

1550, "We have neutralized the first beam cannon!"

1551, "Good work. The Demon has only one beam turret operational."

1552, "We've destroyed the last of the main guns. Excellent job. Concentrate now on the anti-fighter beams and flak cannons."

1553, "The Sathanas is engaging its subspace drives. All units, get out of the way now!"

1554, "You failed this mission, pilot. The Sathanas will be at full strength when it confronts the Colossus. "

1555, "The Beleth has entered the Capella system! We have a massacre on our hands, pilot! Your incompetence has endangered millions of innocent lives! Return to base!"

1556, "The forward flak cannons are down. Good work."

1557, "The Beleth is engaging its jump drive! All units, stand clear!"

1558, "High Noon"

1559, "The Colossus and the Sathanas face off in the Capella system.
"

1560, "The $h Satahanas entered the Capella system and obliterated the line of defense we had established to intercept it. We now have no choice but to send in the $f Colossus. With its beam cannons still operational, the $h Sathanas has sufficient firepower to win this engagement.

Your wing will be scrambled immediately. There is no time to select your ship or armaments. Your mission is to neutralize these remaining beam cannons as quickly as possible. If you fail, we risk losing the $f Colossus and the Capella system. "

1561, "The $h Satahanas has entered the Capella system and engaged the $f Colossus. Your exceptional performance in Gamma Draconis has significantly improved the odds for the Alliance. We are deploying your wing to provide bomber support for the $f Colossus. Eliminate any target of opportunity, but do not take unnecessary risks."

1562, "With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. This operation could not have succeeded without your intervention, pilot. By neutralizing the forward beam cannons of the Sathanas, you gave the Colossus the advantage it required to win the battle.

For your outstanding record of service, you are hereby awarded the Nebula Campaign Victory Star. This medal recognizes your contributions to our mission of exploration and containment, from your first engagement in Gamma Draconis to our victory in the Capella system. Most notably, we commend you for three successful sorties against the Shivan Juggernaut Sathanas. Congratulations, Terran."

1563, "With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. The outcome of this operation would have been more favorable had you completed your objectives. Though the Colossus won the engagement, neutralizing the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons would have reduced the damage it sustained. "

1564, "The GTVA Colossus, the largest Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, over twenty years in the making, has been destroyed. Thirty thousand perished in the Juggernaut's attack, and millions more are in jeopardy. Though you neutralized the four beam cannons, you completed your objectives too late. "

1565, "The GTVA Colossus, the largest Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, over twenty years in the making, has been destroyed. Thirty thousand perished in the Juggernaut's attack, and millions more are in jeopardy. You failed to neutralize the forward beam cannons, pilot, and now we will all pay the price of that failure."

1571, "Help the Colossus neutralize the Sathanas"

1572, "Well done, secure the area and our work here will finished."

1573, "Colossus here. We have sustained moderate damage. Hull breach on forward decks 140 through 200. Damage control reports auxiliary systems compromised."

1574, "Command, this is the Colossus. Hull integrity dropping. Multiple systems approaching critical. Casualty rate escalating."

1575, "Colossus here! Our hull will not sustain another salvo! We must withdraw immediately, Command!"

1576, "We've lost the Colossus! Abort mission, Alpha. Return to base. "

1577, "You have two forward beam cannons to neutralize. Acquire your target and engage!"

1578, "You have only one forward beam cannon to neutralize. Acquire your target and engage!"

1579, "Listen up, Alpha. Eliminate targets of opportunity, but be careful. It's all up to the Colossus now."

1580, "The Sathanas is going down! All units, stand clear!"

1581, "Colossus, the Juggernaut has sustained only moderate damage. You need to direct more energy through your main guns!"

1582, "We're having difficulty stabilizing the power grid, Command. Shutting down non-essential systems."

1583, "More firepower, Colossus! The hull integrity of the Sathanas has fallen below fifty percent. "

1584, "Heat sinks were not made for this kind of abuse, Command! We'll melt down our cannons if we push any harder."

1585, "We're almost there, Colossus! Target has gone critical! The war must end here and now!"

1586, "Secondary and Tertiary reactors are down! Fire control is on the verge of redline! We're giving it all we got!"

1587, "One cannon left! We are running out of time, Alpha! "

1588, "All cannons are down! Repeat! All cannons are down!  Eliminate targets of opportunity, but be careful. It's all up to the Colossus now."

1589, "You completed your mission too late, pilot. The battle has been lost.  Return to base."

1590, "The Shivans have scrambled a wing of fighters, designation Cancer. Do not let them impede your mission, Alpha."

1591, "We have eliminated Cancer wing."

1592, "Return to Babel"

1593, "The 203rd must capture the NTF Iceni, Admiral Bosch's command ship.
"

1594, "Colossus Triumphant

At 0345 hours, the GTVA Colossus destroyed the Shivan juggernaut Sathanas near the Gamma Draconis jump node in Capella. This victory proves without a doubt our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. For the second time, the Alliance defeated a species which has annihilated entire civilizations across this galaxy. 

With the Colossus, we will have nothing more to fear."

1595, "Damage Control

We still have much to accomplish, however. The Sathanas inflicted moderate damage against the Colossus, though its systems remain 80% operational. Terran and Vasudan engineers anticipate it will take several months to fully repair the warship's hull. Until we completely secure the nebula, our evacuation of Capella's civilian population will proceed as planned."

1596, "Chasing the Iceni

With the immediate Shivan threat neutralized, we must now focus on capturing Admiral Bosch. Recon units are scouring the nebula for any sign of his command ship. The Psamtik will lead a task force assigned to recover the Iceni once its position has been determined.

Command has disclosed new information concerning the NTF's secret agenda."

1597, "ETAK

We now know that Admiral Bosch has developed a Shivan communication technology that transmits and modulates quantum pulses. Bosch secretly resurrected a defunct GTI project involving captured Shivan specimen, terminated after the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. Bosch referred to his project as ETAK, short for Etamnanki, the tower that may have inspired the story of Babel."

1598, "Stealing History

Through a rigorous study of Ancient archeology, Bosch learned the location of the Knossos subspace device, the portal to the region of the galaxy where the Ancients first encountered the Shivans. His genocidal war was a smoke screen to cover his plunder of Ancient sites in Vasudan systems. In Deneb, he learned how to activate the portal and deployed the Trinity to power up the device."

1599, "An Infernal Pact

Integral to Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra was an alliance with the Shivans upon their return to our systems. When Bosch realized his regime was on the brink of collapse, he ordered his forces into the nebula to make contact with the enemy. Interrogation of rebel prisoners reveals that only Bosch's immediate subordinates had access to the ETAK project. No further details are available at your level of clearance."

1600, "Circe

You are now authorized to use the GTW-19 Circe. Derived from advanced EM weaponry, the Circe disrupts shield systems by directing a barrage of fluctuating EM harmonics on the target. This energy is completely ineffective against armor plating or insulated subsystems. For this reason, the Circe is best paired with a weapon such as the Maxim or the Prometheus, which inflict heavy hull damage."

1601, "Reconnaissance has located the NTF Iceni. Bosch has made contact with the Shivans a second time. An Azrael-class transport is currently docked with the vessel. A second transport appears to be waiting nearby. We do not know if the Shivans are boarding the Iceni, or if Bosch and his followers are boarding the transports."

1602, "Our objective is to capture the $h Iceni and the ETAK technology. Two Shivan cruisers are guarding the vessel, the $h Azmedaj and the $h Sammael. Once the cruisers have been destroyed, we will deploy a Special Forces unit to board and secure the rebel command ship. Your second objective will be to defend our transport, the $f GVT $f Qeb."

1603, "To our knowledge, the $h Iceni holds the only example of the ETAK technology in existence. Bosch took extraordinary measures to destroy all evidence of his research. If we fail, we have little hope of rebuilding the device. Command has absolute faith in your ability to succeed in this endeavor."

1604, "Our transport failed to dock with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and we lost the communication technology. All evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1605, "Use your squadmates to cover multiple objectives."

1606, "The GVT Qeb rescued the survivors of the Iceni and retrieved the specifications for Bosch's ETAK device. 

Command has classified these materials Level Omega, accessible only by persons specially authorized by the GTVA Security Council. Be advised that divulging any information regarding this operation is punishable under the GTVA Security Act, Antares Convention, Section 15-5-7.

We arrived too late to stop the Azrael transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his immediate subordinates. Our questioning of the survivors reveals the encounter had been violent. The motives of the Shivans cannot be determined, though it seems Bosch's experiment attracted their attention. Reconnaissance is now searching for the Shivan transport.

Against overwhelming odds, you destroyed the Shivan cruisers, protected the Iceni, and escorted the transport safely home. It is indeed an honor to serve with a pilot of your caliber."

1607, "The Shivans destroyed the GVT Qeb while the transport was still docked with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1608, "We were almost there, pilot. Our transport was mere seconds away from jumping to safety. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1609, "Our transport failed to dock with the Iceni, and we lost the ETAK technology. All evidence of Bosch's research has been destroyed.

1617, "I am now reading the Iceni at 1200 meters. The Azrael is docked with the command ship. The first Shivan transport has departed, Command."

1632, "This is the GVT Qeb. We are now in position. Commencing docking sequence."

1633, "Qeb here. Docking point secure. Iceni, stand by for boarding."

1634, "This is Victor 3. We've entered a slaughterhouse, Command. Casualty rate in the thousands. Shivan bodies are among the dead. Proceeding now to deck seven."

1635, "All survivors are now on board the transport. We have the specifications. Undocking now."

1636, "This is the Qeb. Now making the jump to subspace."

1637, "Mission accomplished, pilots. You are authorized to return to base."

1638, "This is Lt. Rusk, NTF Iceni! We need immediate extraction! Please assist!"

1639, "What's your status, Iceni?"

1640, "The Shivans boarded us! They killed everyone!  I've got thirty-three survivors on deck seven. There's got to be more below."

1641, "Where's Admiral Bosch?"

1642, "They took him away, with Gibson and Sarno and about a dozen others. You've got to get us out of here NOW!"

1643, "Is the communication technology on board?"

1644, "Listen to me! Bosch initiated the self-destruct sequence! We have only a few minutes left!"

1645, "Transmit the specifications of the ETAK device now, Iceni."

1646, "No can do. You get us out alive, Command, I'll get you those specs! You understand?"

1647, "Acknowledged. Now deploying GVT Qeb. Stand by."

1648, "Our fighters must eliminate these cruisers first, Iceni. Stand by."

1649, "I'm telling you there's no time, Command! Get us out of here now!"

1650, "Hull integrity has fallen below critical! We're gonna die out here, Command! Get us some fighter cover!"

1651, "Iceni, we've lost the GVT Qeb. We're deploying a second transport."

1652, "Self-destruct in thirty seconds, Command! You're out of time."

1653, "Transmit the specs, Lieutenant. This is your last chance to redeem yourself."

1654, "Sorry, Command. We're taking that secret to hell with us. Believe me. You don't want to know. Rusk out."

1655, "The Azrael has undocked with the Iceni. The vessel is preparing to engage its subspace drive."

1656, "We've lost the transport! Repeat! We've lost the transport!"

1657, "Straight, No Chaser"

1658, "The 203rd pursues the Shivan Azrael transport to an uncharted region of the nebula."

1659, "At 1640 hours, reconnaissance detected the Shivan transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his subordinates deep within a Shivan-controlled zone of the nebula. A wing of $h Maras repelled our recon unit, but we now have an approximate location. Alpha and Beta, your mission is to find and disable the $h Azrael transport."

1660, "The attack must be executed quickly, before the transport escapes. Once its engines are disabled, defend the transport until the recovery team arrives on $f Lambda $f 1. They will dock with the $h Azrael and haul the vessel back to Gamma Draconis. $f Lambda $f 2 will be standing by in case $f Lambda $f 1 should fail."

1661, "Capturing Bosch and his lieutenants is of the utmost importance. We do not know if they are alive or dead, or what the Shivans intend to do with them."

1662, "Welcome to the GVD Memphis, Terran. The annihilation of the Psamtik and the thousands on board is a tragedy for all Vasudans. A people birthed in sorrow will die in sorrow, as the old proverb goes. The discovery of the second Knossos portal was of extraordinary significance, but there will be no expedition.

Allied forces have sighted multiple Sathanas-class juggernauts converging on our positions throughout the nebular theater. We stand on the brink of a new Shivan resurgence, and our systems are once again in jeopardy. 

For the second time, Command has ordered a full retreat of all allied vessels from the nebula. We will withdraw immediately to the Capella system, where we will mount our defense. However, not even the Colossus has the firepower to repel a juggernaut fleet.

With the disappearance of the Azrael, and the extreme secrecy surrounding the Alliance's handling of the ETAK project, it could be many years before we learn what happened out here."

1672, "Command, we are under attack!"

1673, "We are reading hostile indicators on radar. Unable to acquire lock."

1674, "Maintain your current heading. Recon tracked the Azrael to that position. It must be somewhere nearby."

1676, "Say again, pilot? Another subspace portal?"

1677, "Affirmative. The device has been activated."

1678, "Can you locate the Azrael?"

1679, "Negative. There is no sign of the Shivan transport."

1680, "All units, secure the area! Nullify all enemy ships! We have a new objective! We must seize control of this portal!"

1681, "We are picking up a Cain-class cruiser on sensors, the SC Dahaka!"

1686, "9,000 meters? You're way off course, Psamtik! What happened?"

1687, "The subspace field generated by the portal appears to have interfered with our transit."

1688, "Pilots, head directly for the Psamtik. We need time to get the ship into position."

1689, "The Psamtik will spearhead our exploration of the region beyond the portal. You will escort the Psamtik until we deploy our expeditionary force."

1690, "All units, defend the Psamtik! Do not allow the Shivan attack to build momentum!"

1691, "What is it, Psamtik? Can you identify?"

1692, "Affirmative! Sathanas configuration! Repeat! Sathanas configuration!"

1693, "That's impossible, Psamtik!"

1694, "The Sathanas has opened fire! We are sustaining massive hull damage!"

1695, "Psamtik, get out of there! Now! We're pulling you out!"

1696, "Jump drive inoperative! All systems compromised! Catastrophic hull failure imminent!"

1697, "Psamtik, do you copy? Come in, Psamtik! This is Allied Command! Do you read me?"

1698, "Pilots, you will jump to the GVD Memphis. Your nav computer has the coordiantes. Return to base!"

1704, "Admiral Petrarch reports that his gunners destroyed the $h Urobach and all but one of the fighter wings. With the entire Shivan armada now heading for Terran-Vasudan space, we must get the $f Aquitaine out as soon as possible. Your mission is to defend the $f Aquitaine until its propulsion systems are restored."

1705, "A damage control team is currently en route from Gamma Draconis. The $f GTC $f Agrippa, an Aeolus-class warship, escorts the $f Argo transport carrying the team and the components needed for the repair. When the $f Argo arrives, your objective will be to ensure it docks safely with the damaged destroyer."

1706, "The $f Aquitaine's Engineering Officer estimates that once the damage control team arrives with the required materials, the repair will be accomplished in a matter of minutes. However, this provides the Shivans sufficient time to launch additional wings and threaten the $f Aquitaine."

1707, "With sorrow, we remember the 10,000 officers and crew of the GTD Aquitaine. They fought courageously and died with valor. 

Your next assignment would have been on board the Aquitaine, leading the 70th Blue Lions squadron. However, with these recent developments, you have been reassigned to fly support for the 12th Fleet in the remote Wolf 359 system. 

Your transport departs at 0150."

1708, "Stay close to the Aquitaine. Use its defenses to your advantage."

1709, "Because of your actions, the GTD Aquitaine safely reached the Gamma Draconis system. The damage to the vessel's fighterbay and targeting system is now being repaired. 

Vasudan Tactical Command has informed us you are to be transferred immediately to the GTD Aquitaine for your next assignment. You will serve as leader of the elite 70th Blue Lions. However, you have also received an urgent transmission from Special Operations Command. Your talents are in demand, pilot. 

For your exceptional service to the crown of Emperor Khonsu II, Heir of the Dynasty of Ten Thousand Years, you are hereby inducted into the Imperial Order of Vasuda. Rarely is this honor conferred upon those of your species. Congratulations, Terran."

Nine Sathanas juggernauts have now entered the Capella system, and Intelligence has sighted even more in the nebula, converging on the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. 

We are on the threshold of a new apocalypse. Though the juggernauts have not engaged our warships, they have set course for the Capella star. We can only speculate about their intentions, but this development cannot bode well for the Alliance."

1751, "Exodus

Allied Command is committed to evacuating all non-essential personnel. A contingency plan is in the works to hold the Shivans here, in Capella, and prevent the expansion of the Shivan incursion to other systems of the GTVA. 

The 70th Blue Lions will provide the fighter cover needed to get our convoys out of the system. Millions of lives are at stake here, pilot. And if we fail, all our worlds and systems will be in jeopardy."

1752, "Erinyes Fighter

The GTVA has just unveiled the newly developed Erinyes-class heavy assault fighter. With eight gun banks, you'll have sufficient firepower to make short work of enemy targets at close range.  The Erinyes can accommodate fire control for up to two different primary systems. 

You may need to allocate more power to weapons to fight effectively, so make adjustments as needed."

1753, "GTW UD-8 Kayser

You have also been issued the GTW UD-08 Kayser. For its limited OpEval period, only select units will be authorized to carry this weapon. The Kayser emits focused wavelets of subatomic particles that bombard the target, causing the wave function of the particles to collapse and emit intense zero-point energy microbursts. The Kayser is the product of our research into Shivan weapon technology."

1754, "GTM-11 Infyrno

Finally, we have received the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. To use the Infyrno, press your secondary trigger once to launch the missile, then press it again to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the distance of the warhead from your ship.  Upon detonation, the Infyrno releases multiple submunitions which themselves contain ultra-high explosive charges."

1755, "As we speak, convoys of transports, freighters, and medical ships are heading for the jump nodes to Vega and Epsilon Pegasi. The evacuation of civilian personnel proceeds on schedule, but the enemy offensive has intensified. We have blockaded the Gamma Draconis node, though Shivan forces are swarming into the system."

1756, "The 53rd will relieve the 309th at the Gamma Draconis node, and we'll deploy the 19th to hold down the fort at 3rd Fleet Headquarters as we evacuate non-essential personnel. Command needs a closer look at the Juggernauts, so we'll be sending in the 91st.  70th Blue Lions will be sortied to the Epsilon Pegasi node."

1757, "Blue Lions, your mission is to escort a four-ship convoy to Epsilon Pegasi. The group consists of civilian transports $f Lambda $f 1 and $f 2, $f GTFr $f Sulla, and the medical ship $f GTM $f Vesalius. All have minimal armaments and vulnerable hull plating. $f GVCv $f Nebtuu leads the escort."

1758, "At 1415 hours, the Shivan corvette $h Abraxis and a wing of $h Manticore fighters attacked the convoy. The $f Nebtuu called for assistance, so you're going in. Theta wing will stand by to reinforce your position. Call them in at your discretion. Good luck, pilots. The people of Capella are counting on you."

1759, "Do not jump out until ordered to do so. You should not be making this mistake at this stage of your career."

1760, "Excellent work, pilot. Your first sortie as leader of the 70th Blue Lions proved you are just the officer to lead this outfit. The Shivans launched a savage attack, but you and your squadron held them off. Because of your tactical leadership, the entire convoy safely reached Epsilon Pegasi. 
"

1761, "The Shivans launched a massive offensive against all our outbound convoys. The death toll has escalated into the hundred of thousands. We do not have the resources to defend every ship escaping this system. Even your elite 70th Blue Lions failed to complete all mission objectives."

1762, "Both Lambda transports perished in the Shivan attack. Thousands of civilians were lost."

1763, "Both Lambda transports reached Epsilon Pegasi. Your efforts saved thousands of lives. "

1764, "One of the Lambda transports reached the jump node. Half the civilians perished in the Shivan attack."

1765, "Relief workers in Vega and Epsilon Pegasi report a shortage of vital provisions and medical supplies. The loss of the Sulla will only complicate matters."

1766, "We managed to save the GTFr Sulla. The provisions it carried will help alleviate the supply shortages in Epsilon Pegasi."

1767, "The destruction of the GTM Vesalius is a tragedy. With the casualties the Shivans have inflicted in Capella, every medical vessel is vital to our efforts."

1768, "The GTM Vesalius arrived in Epsilon Pegasi. The medical vessel will play a crucial role in handling the influx of refugees from Capella."

1769, "Your squadron eliminated all hostile targets. If we are to halt the Shivan advance, every effort must be made to diminish the enemy force."

1770, "We need to deploy your unit to 3rd Fleet Headquarters pronto. Assemble your squadron in the ready room."

1803, "We've lost Lambda 2! They're slaughtering us out there!"

1804, "Lambda 1! Come in, Lambda 1! We've lost your signal! "

1805, "The GTM Vesalius has been destroyed. All personnel on board were lost."

1806, "Alpha, the Nebtuu is gone. All allied warships are currently engaged. You're on your own out there."

1807, "The Shivans wiped out our entire convoy. Return to base, Alpha."

1808, "The Sulla has engaged its jump drives and is now en route for Epsilon Pegasi."

1809, "The civilians are now all accounted for. 50% survived the engagement. "

1815, "At 2345 hours, Allied Command authorized the immediate evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters in the Capella system. The installation has come under heavy fighter and bomber attack. The Shivans are deploying their wings from the $h SD $h Nebiros, a Ravana-class destroyer. The 19th squadron, assigned to defend headquarters, has been wiped out."

1816, "The evacuation will proceed as follows. $f Lambda $f 1, an Argo-class transport, will dock with the installation. Personnel will then board the Argo, which will take them to the $f GTD $f Messana. Command will deploy a second transport to extract the remaining personnel on board the installation. The injured have already been transferred to the medical vessel $f GTM $f Galen."

1817, "After $f Lambda $f 2 has docked with the $f Orion, the $f Messana will leave the system, and you will be authorized to return to base. You will take Alpha and Delta wings and provide fighter cover for this operation. You must protect the installation, the $f Messana, and the two transports. Once evacuated, the installation will be destroyed."

1818, "We have already extracted non-essential personnel, so the operation should proceed quickly. With the evacuation of Headquarters, the Alliance is preparing to initiate the final phase of its plan to hold the Shivans in Capella."

1819, "Outstanding work, pilot. Both Lambda transports safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was a complete success. Under your capable leadership, the 70th Blue Lions upholds its standing among the elite squadrons of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance.

The GTVA Security Council has revealed its strategy for holding the Shivans in the Capella system. I will address the officers and crew of the Aquitaine in one hour. The 70th Blue Lions will play a critical role in the upcoming operation. I know that you and your squadron are up to the challenge."

1820, "Though we lost the first transport, Lambda 2 safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was only a partial success. Under the circumstances, this outcome is perhaps the best we could hope for. However, may I remind you that elite squadrons earn their status by going above and beyond the call of duty.

1824, "The loss of the GTD Messana is a tragedy. Many friends and colleagues perished today, and we are left only to ask what could we have done to save them. As Commanding Officer of the Aquitaine, I placed my faith in you and your squadron. The 70th Blue Lions have earned a reputation as one of the finest units in the GTVA. But reputations do not save lives. Reputations do not achieve results. I have no choice but to relieve you of your command. You are dismissed, pilot."

1868, "The 70th Blue Lions participate in a feint at the Gamma Draconis jump node.
"

1869, "Exodus

With over one hundred thousand casualties and more Shivans incoming, we have no hope of holding Capella. Our only real chance is to seal off the system and prevent the invasion from spreading to other Terran-Vasudan worlds. If we fail to contain the Shivan advance, we will unleash the second Great War, a conflict we have virtually no chance of surviving. The Lucifer fleet we defeated 32 years ago is nothing compared to the strength of this armada. Command is committed to getting every last Terran out of the system."

1870, "A Subspace Anomaly

Over 80 Shivan Juggernauts are now in position around the Capella sun. Science vessels monitoring their activity have detected an anomalous subspace field rippling from the Juggernaut fleet. Though we can barely detect the field with our instruments, its intensity has been increasing slowly over the past seventy-two hours. We have known since the Great War that the Shivans possess advanced subspace technologies, but this field goes beyond our wildest speculations. The Shivans may be powering up a new kind of weapon, the likes of which we have never before encountered."

1871, "Sacrifice

Preparations are now underway to collapse the Epsilon Pegasi jump node. A Great-War-era destroyer, the GTD Bastion, will contain multiple meson warheads that will detonate inside the node. Scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse, as evidenced by the destruction of the Lucifer 32 years ago. The detonation of the Lucifer's reactors sealed off the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis and severed all contact with Earth. The Bastion has completed its modifications in the Vega system and is now entering Capella."

1872, "Will the Strategy Work?

Skeptics have argued the Shivans made intersystem jumps without using nodes in Ross 128, Ikeya, Vega, and other systems at the outbreak of the Great War. However, scientists assure us this plan will work. Though Shivans have used uncharted nodes and nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels, they are as dependent on jump nodes as we are. Nevertheless, we must accept this strategy as nothing more than a temporary measure."

1873, "Endgame

Once we have evacuated all civilian and military personnel from the Capella system, we will send a second destroyer, also carrying meson warheads, through the Capella jump node in Vega. If we succeed in sealing off both nodes, the Alliance will have trapped the Shivans in this system. If we fail, we face certain annihilation. 

This is our Alamo, pilots. We hold them here, or we die trying."

1874, "The $f GTD $f Bastion will enter the Capella system at 1835 hours. We're sending in the 116th to escort the warship into position. Our forward observer units near the Juggernauts are calling for backup, so we'll send in the 83rd. The 309th will assist with the containment effort at the Vega node, and as for the 70th Blue Lions, we've got something special for you."

1875, "Your mission is to create a diversion at the Gamma Draconis node. The operation here will be a feint to lure the Shivan armada. The $f Colossus and its group will form a battle line near the node. By focusing our firepower here, we'll draw the brunt of the Shivan offensive. Meanwhile, on the other side of the system, the $f Bastion will collapse the node to Epsilon Pegasi."

1876, "Your objectives are simple. Destroy all enemy targets. Be advised reinforcements will not be readily available. In a recent engagement, the $f Colossus sustained damage to its fighterbays. You'll have to hold out until they get the flight deck cleared. Good luck, pilot."

1877, "The Colossus has been destroyed. Over thirty thousand officers and crew, our colleagues, compatriots, and friends, perished in this battle. The most powerful Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, twenty years in the making, was vaporized in a matter of minutes.

Command acknowledges there was nothing you could have done to save the Colossus. Many of your squadmates were killed, and you are lucky to have survived the engagement. However, we have no time to mourn the dead. We have a job to do, and if we fail, millions more will suffer and die.

The 70th Blue Lions are being scrambled to assist the Bastion. Report to the ready room on the double."

The $f Bastion will be detonated inside the node to create a subspace cataclysm that will seal off the Capella system. If the $f Bastion fails to achieve this objective, the Shivans will swarm into our adjacent systems."

1912, "The task force defending the $f Bastion has been decimated. Three ships remain: the $f Templar, the $f Malta, and the $f Ertanax. All are Aeolus-class cruisers. The Shivans continue to send wave after wave of fighters and bombers. Only a handful of the $f Bastion's original fighter complement have survived the onslaught."

1913, "Alpha, Delta, and Beta wings will fly heavy intercept. Your mission is to take out enemy bombers before they close within targeting distance. You'll be armed with the Trebuchet missile, which has an effective range of four kilometers. Gamma wing will fly the Perseus. Their role will be to engage enemy fighters. "

1914, "The majority of the fleet is fending off a massive attack at the Vega node. Thousands of civilians await evacuation and the enemy continues to flood in from Gamma Draconis.

The Security Council has authorized the deployment of the $f GTD $f Nereid. The destroyer will depart from the Vega system and collapse the node in fifteen minutes. We must therefore complete our evacuation of Capella by that time. Any ship that remains behind will be trapped with the Shivan armada.

Your objective is to defend our convoys as they flee through the Vega node. Cargo ships, personnel transports, medical vessels, and the remnants of the allied fleet are now in transit. These convoys are under heavy bomber fire. If we don't provide cover, thousands will die. 

Your secondary objective is to prevent Shivan warships from entering the Vega node. The Allied fleet has been pulverized, so for the sake of all Terrans and Vasudans, the war must end here. You will receive authorization to enter the Vega node and leave the system once the $f Nereid has been deployed."

Welcome to Vega, Ensign. I am Lieutenant Loukakis, squadron leader of the 53rd Hammerheads. You have been assigned to our unit. The Hammerheads are a space superiority squadron. We'll be flying the Myrmidon fighter, developed to replace the old GTF Ulysses. The Myrmidon is a Terran-Vasudan design and a versatile ship with high marks for speed, maneuverability, armor, and loadout."

2118, "History of the 53rd

The 53rd Hammerheads were formed during the Great War. At the time, we served on board the GTD Bastion, the finest ship in the history of Terran space travel. You may not know this, but the pilots who destroyed the SD Lucifer in 2335 were based on the Bastion, and some were even Hammerheads. With the 53rd, you're part of a long and proud tradition."

When the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the jump node to the Sol system and severed all contact with Earth, Command transferred the Bastion to the 4th Fleet in Vega. Since then we've called Vega our home. Now Command has de-commissioned the Bastion and reassigned its squadrons to the newer Hecate destroyers. We'll be joining the GTD Aquitaine, flagship of the 3rd Fleet, Capella."

2225, "Your weapons loadout is displayed to the right of your reticle. Primary cannons are listed above your secondary missile banks."

2226, "Use your primary weapon selector [Press $.$] to toggle either one or both cannons to fire. Firing both primaries will inflict more damage but will also drain more energy from your fighter's reserves."

2227, "The Myrmidon space superiority fighter has three missile banks. As a new pilot, you will be authorized to use the Tempest dumbfire and the Rockeye heat-seeker. Let's practice firing the Tempest."

2228, "Use your secondary weapon selector [Press $/$] to arm your bank of Tempest missiles."

2229, "Good. Tempests are dumb-fire projectiles. These warheads have no homing system, so they'll fly in the direction in which they are fired. For this reason, they are most effective at close range. Unless your aim is very precise, hitting targets at a distance with the Tempest may be difficult."

2230, "Now select Drone 01 using your hostile targeting control. [Press $h$]"

2231, "Good. Destroy Drone 01 with your Tempest missiles. [Press $spacebar$] Close your distance if you need to."

2232, "Well done. The Tempest may not be as accurate as a heat- or aspect-seeking missile, but a Myrmidon can carry up to 320 of these missiles. A volley of Tempests will quickly pulverize an enemy fighter."

2233, "To maximize their effectiveness, use them in conjunction with your Subach HL-7. While the lasers penetrate the shields of your target, the missiles will impact the enemy's hull."

2234, "Let's move on to the Rockeye heat-seeker. Arm the Rockeye with your secondary weapon selector. [Press $/$]"

2235, "Well done. Now target Drone 02. [Press $h$]"

2236, "When you fire the Rockeye, the missile's tracking system will lock onto the heat signature of your target. Be aware the homing radius of the Rockeye is limited, and your target must be near the center of your HUD."

2237, "Destroy Drone 02 using your Rockeye missiles. [Press $spacebar$]"

2238, "Nice shooting, pilot. Compared to the Tempest, the Rockeye is more accurate and has a greater effective range. However, the Myrmidon can carry no more than 20 Rockeyes."

2239, "You can also toggle double-fire mode to launch twice the ordnance. [Press $Shift-/$] You will inflict more damage and increase your chances of hitting the target, but your missiles will be depleted more rapidly in double-fire mode."

2240, "We will now send in more drones so you can practice firing missiles. Be sure to toggle between banks so you can get a feel for both the Tempest and the Rockeye."

2241, "When you run low on missiles, you need to rearm your fighter. To do this you must call in a support ship."

2242, "First, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key to Rearm."

2243, "In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your fighter to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you."

2244, "In the lower portion of your HUD, an indicator displays the support ship's ETA."

2245, "The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your secondary weapons and countermeasures."

2246, "Second, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to your ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem.  However, the support ship cannot repair your hull."

2247, "Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to completely rearm your fighter."

2248, "We covered a lot in this module. If you need to review this material, replay the simulation. Otherwise, you are qualified to proceed to TSM-103a. Engage your subspace drive."

Welcome to the 107th Ravens, pilot. I'm Lieutenant Samsa, squadron leader.  As you know, the Aquitaine is now en route to the Gamma Draconis system. The details of the situation there have been classified at the highest level, so I'm as much in the dark as you are. The Admiral will brief the crew when we reach 3rd Fleet headquarters in Capella."

2306, "The 107th Ravens

The 107th is a heavy assault squadron, so our fighter of choice is the Hercules Mark II. Implementing advances in fusion drive technology, the Mark II improves the assault fighter's speed and maneuverability without sacrificing loadout. The Herc has only two missile banks, but its ordnance capacity is greater than the Myrmidon's. The original Herc won the Great War, so we're proud to carry on the tradition."

2307, "The Hercules Mark II

I recommend that you review the Herc II training modules before the Aquitaine arrives in Capella. These modules review advanced tactics, such as countermeasures and energy management. The Herc II is slower than the Myrmidon you've been flying with the 53rd, so learn how to evade missiles and equalize shields. These skills will help you push your fighter to the limits. Master them, and the life you save may be your own."

2308, "New Weapons

According to your file, you are now authorized to use the GTW-5a Prometheus R, the GTM-19 Harpoon, and the GTM-4 Hornet missile. 

The Prometheus R is a retrofit of a cannon developed during the Great War. After the Alliance lost contact with Earth, we lacked materials required for mass production, so engineers developed this retrofit version. The Prometheus packs a bigger wallop than the Subach HL-7, but it will drain your power reserves with extended use."

2309, "New Weapons

The Harpoon and the Hornet are both aspect-seeking missiles. While the Harpoon fires individual warheads, the Hornet launches a swarm of four projectiles, eight if you're in double-fire mode. The training modules cover the proper technique for firing aspect-seeking missiles, so be sure to review that section carefully. That's all for now, pilot. The Aquitaine will arrive in Capella in four hours."

2332, "For Class A qualification, you learned how to call in a support ship to rearm and repair subsystems. Now we'll show you how to give orders to pilots under your command."

2333, "Our target for this simulation will be an Argo-class transport."

2334, "Target the transport. Use your hostile targeting control. [$h$]"

2335, "Good. Now you'll call in your reinforcements. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window. Select reinforcements [4]. Then select the wing you want to call in. Epsilon wing is your only option, so hit the [1] key."

2336, "Confirm that you still have the transport targeted. [$h$]"

2337, "Now have Epsilon wing destroy the transport. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging box again."

2338, "Select [2] to transmit your orders to a specific wing. Then hit [1] to choose Epsilon wing.  By selecting Epsilon wing, you are sending your orders to that wing only."

2339, "Now press the [1] key, and Epsilon will destroy your target."

2340, "Well done, pilot! Let's try this again."

2341, "Order Epsilon wing to destroy Transport 02. Do you remember your previous instruction?  If not, consult the directives list."

2342, "Good work. Be aware that fighter wings are less effective against larger targets. Bombers or vessels with beam turrets are usually required to destroy warships larger than cruiser class."

2343, "Also note that reinforcements are not always available, and you will have authorization to issue orders only to specific wings and ships."

2344, "Now let's order Epsilon wing to depart."

2345, "Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

2346, "Excellent work. As you gain experience in combat, using the communications interface will become second nature."

2347, "All right, pilot. Now it's time to learn about countermeasures."

2348, "When you launch a countermeasure, you present a new target for pursuing missiles. In theory, the missiles should hit the countermeasure instead of ripping a hole through your hull."

2349, "You need to use countermeasures to survive in battle, but you'll soon learn this tactic does not always work."

2350, "For this exercise, we'll bring in a Leviathan-class cruiser."

2351, "The cruiser will now launch missiles at you.  Press the countermeasures [$x$] key to evade the missiles."

2352, "Immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum and move away from the pursuing missiles.  Punch your afterburners [$tab$] to gain that extra burst of speed."

2353, "A yellow triangle will appear on your HUD, indicating the vector of the missile's approach. Try to keep this indicator in the 3 or 9 o'clock position."

2354, "When the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile. The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

2355, "While launching countermeasures, turn your fighter hard in sharp movements. This will also help throw the missile off your trail."

2356, "If you evade the missile, an indicator will display in the upper portion of your targeting reticle. This will alert you to the fact that you successfully avoided the projectile."

2357, "The number of countermeasures remaining is indicated on your HUD below the weapons display. If you run out of countermeasures, call in the support ship to reload."

2358, "You've sustained heavy damage from those missiles, pilot. You are advised to review TSM-107m. Your chances of survival will be minimal if you cannot use countermeasures effectively."

2359, "That's enough for evading missiles. Now let's practice firing them."

2360, "Your Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter is armed with two banks of Harpoons."

2361, "Unlike heat-seekers like the Rockeye, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

2362, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth the effort because its homing ability is much stronger."

2363, "If a heat seeker loses track of its target, chances are it will not reacquire lock. Aspect seekers, on the other hand, will track their targets until they detonate."

2364, "Transport 03 is now entering.  Let's take this opportunity to learn another targeting control."

2365, "You have a reticle targeting control [$y$] that will acquire the nearest object inside your reticle. Maneuver your fighter so that my ship is centered on your HUD."

2366, "Good. Now use the reticle targeting control [$y$] to target my fighter."

2367, "Well done. Now target Transport 03 using the reticle targeting control. [$y$] Make sure the transport is in the center of your HUD."

2368, "Excellent. Now let's see how you do with those Harpoons."

2369, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Triangle.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This means your Harpoons are locked and ready to fire."

2370, "Now fire one Harpoon at the freighter."

2371, "Note how fast the Harpoon moves.  This warhead delivers quite a punch."

2372, "A round of Harpoons can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

2373, "The Harpoon is almost useless if fired before lock has been acquired. That's a major distinction between the Harpoon and the Rockeye."

2374, "Now unload your Harpoons until you've destroyed Transport 03."

2375, "Excellent job.  Let's see how you do against moving targets."

2376, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed position inside your HUD reticle."

2377, "We'll now bring in the fighter drones. When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock. Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

2378, "Once you have acquired lock, fire a Harpoon to destroy the drone.  These drones will not be using countermeasures."

2379, "Well done.  All aspect seekers function this way, from the Hornet missile to the Helios torpedo. In general, the larger and more powerful the warhead, the longer it will take to acquire lock and countdown between volleys."

2380, "Now let's have you face a real challenge.  Multiple wings will appear simultaneously.  Destroy them all."

2381, "You must be in range of your target before you can gain aspect lock.  Hit your burners to intercept the drones."

2382, "Your missile banks are almost depleted. Call in the support ship to rearm. [Press $Shift-R$]"

2404, "First, let's take a look at the gauges and controls for your shield system."

2405, "The Alliance acquired shielding technology from the Shivans during the Great War. Shield systems have been standard on Terran-Vasudan fighters and bombers for over thirty years."

2406, "Your shield system generates an energy shell that protects the hull of your ship from primary fire and missile blasts."

2407, "As they absorb damage, your shields will weaken. However, your fighter will automatically regenerate its shields over time."

2408, "Your shield integrity gauge is located in the lower right of your HUD.  This gauge is now flashing."

2409, "Your shield is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant can withstand limited damage."

2410, "When a shield quadrant sustains damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

2411, "Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken a hit."

2412, "Observe how the gauge changes as your shield sustains more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage on that quadrant will impact the hull of your fighter."

2413, "Your shields will regenerate themselves automatically.  Let's accelerate this process to save time."

2414, "Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

2415, "Your shield is now fully recharged."

2416, "Effective shield management can mean the difference between life and death."

2417, "The simplest way to manage your shield is the Equalize Quadrants function."

2418, "I have damaged your front quadrant again.  Use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your shields.  [Press $q$]"

2419, "Well done.  Your front section has been partially recharged.  This shield energy came from your other three quadrants."

2420, "Practice this function often."

2421, "I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero power."

2422, "With your shield management controls, you can maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

2423, "First, maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]"

2424, "Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the other quadrants have been drained."

2425, "Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking the turret of a large ship."

2426, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

2427, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can deflect the gunfire of your pursuer."

2428, "Now Equalize Quadrants again to distribute shield energy evenly around your ship. [$q$]"

2429, "We will conclude this module with an overview of your energy transfer system, or ETS."

2430, "You can use your ETS controls to augment or diminish the energy allocated to each of these three systems."

2431, "First, let's increase your weapons energy allocation. [Press $insert$ four times.] Observe that as you divert power to weapons, the energy levels for shields and engines drop."

2432, "The more energy diverted to weapons, the faster your primaries will recharge. Your weapons will not inflict greater damage at higher ETS levels."

2433, "High-energy cannons, such as the Prometheus, can quickly deplete your weapon reserves. If you require a sustained barrage of gunfire, diverting energy to primaries may be necessary."

2434, "Now let's increase your shield allocation. [Press $home$ three times.]"

2435, "The higher your ETS setting for shields, the faster they'll recharge. Increasing your shield allocation may be critical in combat situations, such as stopping to rearm your fighter or flying through heavy flak."

2436, "Now divert more power to your engines. [Press $page up$ twice.]"

2437, "Increasing power to engines will improve your maximum speed by up to 30%, depending on the fighter's reactor capacity. Your afterburners will also recharge faster, enabling more frequent bursts of speed."

2438, "For a slower fighter like the Hercules Mark II, increasing engine power may be necessary to chase down more maneuverable targets or cover large distances quickly."

2439, "Well done. This concludes module TSM-107se. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

Lieutenant Commander Cordova here. Welcome to the 242nd Suicide Kings, pilot. I've heard from unofficial channels that the rebels have launched a surprise attack in the Epsilon Pegasi system. Details at this point are sketchy below Phi level clearance, and Command is in no hurry to fill us in. Petrarch says he'll brief the Aquitaine when we reach Capella."

2444, "The 242nd Suicide Kings

The GTA formed the Suicide Kings in the Great War, when the old Valkyrie fighter went into service after the Shivan attack on Ross 128. The 242nd was stationed on the Galatea back then, and our first mission was the capture of Lieutenant Alexander McCarthy. We all studied the McCarthy trials in school, pilot. We're a part of history here, though the Galatea is long gone and the Valkyrie has since been retired."

2445, "The Perseus Interceptor

The Perseus is the next-generation interceptor, the fastest fighter in the GTVA. Our primary combat role is charging bombers and chasing down warheads. We're also assigned to surgical strikes against bigger warships. We're not called the Suicide Kings for nothing, pilot. We earn that name on every mission. For that reason, I suggest you review the Perseus training modules as soon as possible. There you'll learn how to target bombs and turrets and everything else you need to serve in an intercept squadron."

2472, "Don't be afraid. This is only a training simulator. Just observe the action for now."

2473, "As the Seraphim bombers approach the Deimos, they launch their ordnance."

2474, "Use the bomb targeting control [$b$] to acquire the Shivan warheads. If there are no warheads in flight, this control will select the nearest bomber."

2475, "The bomb will appear in your Target View until it detonates. Observe that as the bomb impacts the hull of the Deimos, the name of the corvette flashes in your escort monitor. That's how you know a ship on your escort list is taking damage."

2476, "Bombs also appear as amber blips on your radar."

2477, "Let's cover one more targeting control. The Target's Attacker function [$g$] enables you to select the enemy ship attacking your target. This is especially useful in defensive or escort missions."

2478, "First, select the vessel you have been ordered to defend. Cycle through friendly targets [$f$] or use the escort targeting control. [$e$]"

2479, "Very good. Now use the target's attacker control [$g$] to acquire the nearest hostile currently attacking your target. That would be the Seraphim."

2480, "Now let's see how well you do in a combat situation. To make things fair, we'll restore the Deimos to full strength."

2481, "Before we unleash the bombers, here are a few more pointers."

2482, "First, locate the bomb by sensors or by sight. You'll destroy the bombs more efficiently if you can rely on visual contact, but sometimes you'll need to use the bomb targeting control if you get disoriented. [$b$]"

2483, "It only takes one or two hits to destroy a bomb, and most warheads are generally slower than your intercept fighter. But don't get too close. The shockwave could damage your hull or knock out your subsystems."

2484, "Obviously, the best tactic is to destroy the bombers before they launch their ordnance. An intercept fighter is built for speed so that you can engage multiple bomber waves across the field of engagement."

2485, "You lost the Deimos, pilot. It's a challenge but not impossible. We'll abort the simulation now so you can start over and try again."

2486, "Excellent work, pilot. You repelled the bomber attack and protected the Deimos."

2487, "Here's another tip. Using the messaging window, you can order your squadmates to protect a target. Pilots assigned to protect a target will help you intercept bombs launched at the target. Chasing bombs is a lot easier when you work together as a team."

2488, "You have depleted your missile banks, pilot. Call in the support ship to rearm. [$Shift-R$]"

2489, "For the next phase of this simulation, let's restore the Deimos to full strength. We'll also change the vessel's IFF status from friendly to hostile."

2490, "Target the corvette using your hostile targeting control.  [Press $h$]"

2491, "Good. As a fighter, you have minimal chance of destroying a large ship on your own. Bombs and beam cannons are much more effective, but these weapons are too big to mount on a fighter."

2492, "However, the speed and maneuverability of the fighter make it ideal for surgical strikes against the turrets and subsystems of larger ships."

2493, "Use the turret targeting control [$k$] to cycle through the turrets of the ship. Observe that the corvette has a range of weapon types, including beam weapons, laser cannons, flak guns, and missile launchers. I'm sure you're well acquainted with all of these by now."

2494, "Observe how the turret is outlined by a large square. The Target View will display the type of turret and its current integrity.  If the targeted object is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2495, "Now target the missile launchers on the Deimos and destroy them."

2496, "Excellent. Once you destroy a turret, your sensors will automatically target the next turret in order of priority."

2497, "Larger warships have dozens of firing points, and in combat situations, you might not have time to cycle through all the turrets to find the one that is firing at you."

2498, "You have an attacker targeting control [$r$] that will select the nearest hostile firing on your ship. If the attacker is a warship, the turret firing on you will be targeted."

2499, "This control can help you prioritize the enemies that pose the greatest danger to your fighter."

2500, "Let's try it now. The Deimos will begin firing on you with one or more of its turrets. "

2501, "Use your attacker targeting control [$r$] to identify the turret firing on you."

2502, "Now destroy the turret. Feel free to use guns and missiles. Note that both heat-seeking and aspect-seeking missiles will home in on subsystems once they acquire lock."

2503, "Good. Now let's see how you do against multiple turrets."

2504, "Great work, pilot."

2505, "Looks like you've had enough. In the field of battle, approach a warship with the utmost caution. With a fast and light ship like the Perseus, stay on the move at all times. Destroy the turret in two or three strafing runs if you have to."

2506, "Let's end this session with a look at targeting subsystems."

2507, "By pressing the subsystem targeting control [$s$] repeatedly, you can cycle through the subsystems of your target."

2508, "A subsystem appears on your HUD outlined by a large square. If the targeted system is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2509, "Now target the sensors on the corvette.  [Press $s$]"

2510, "Nice work. Now select the Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun, or SDG, as your primary weapons. [$.$]"

2511, "The Akheton SDG is an energy weapon developed by the Vasudans. The Akheton destroys the subsystems of a target, doing only minimal damage to the target's hull."

2512, "Using the Akheton SDG, destroy the sensors of the Deimos corvette."

2513, "Good. Note that you can also order your squadmates to destroy the subsystems of your target. In the messaging window, select the Disable command to take out the engines. The Disarm command will order the pilots to destroy your target's weapons subsystem."

2514, "Well done. This concludes module TSM-122x. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2515, "You did not follow instructions. You have failed module TSM-122x Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation. [$Alt-J$]"

2516, "Now, intercept and destroy the Seraphim bombers before they neutralize the corvette."

2891, "What about our mission, sir?"

2892, "We have orders to follow, sir."

2893, "You are deserting the field of engagement, Terran."

2894, "You are violating our mission directives, Terran."

2895, "Sorry it had to end like this, sir!"

2896, "No mercy for traitors in this unit!"

2897, "See you in hell, pilot!"

As with the basic Amazon, these are now encountered only in the virtual battlefields of the TSM training module series. The Model VII is used to simulate assaults on enemy capital ships, training fighter and bomber pilots to target turrets and ship subsystems. Command has found that virtual training against Model VIIs increases the survival rate of pilots by 37% when attacking capital ships."

3037, "The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle.

The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTVA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

3039, "TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTVA reuses the containers in many capacities."

3040, "The GTFr Poseidon is the smaller of the two standard Terran military freighters. Though it carries only half as much cargo as the Triton, the Poseidon is more often chosen for dangerous missions. Its greater speed gives it better survivability on the front lines, as does the fact that it has four weapon turrets, compared to the Triton's two. When Allied Command sends supplies and munitions that have to get through, a Poseidon is usually chosen to transport them."

3041, "
The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTVA for deep space cargo transport. Its thin hull will preserve Terran-standard atmospheric conditions inside, as long as the hull seal has not been comprised by weapon fire or collision. TC 2 containers are cheap to manufacture and heavily used everywhere but the front lines (where the armored TAC 1 containers are employed, when available)."

3042, "
The TSC 2 container is armored, providing more protection for its cargo than does the TC 2. This armor serves mainly to protect against hull breaches due to collisions, as it's not thick enough to provide much protection against enemy attacks. TSC 2s are used in busy supply depots in which collision damage is a hazard."

3043, "The TAC 1 is a very heavily armored type of Terran cargo container. It is most often used to hold delicate or valuable cargoes. TAC 1s are generally found in front-line operations in which protection from enemy attacks is a primary consideration."

3044, "The TTC 1 is a civilian cargo container modified for military use. It is a dense-hulled container originally designed to protect fragile technical and scientific equipment. The same protection is now used to guard against collision and attack damage to replacement ship subsystems and other electronic equipment intended for combat spacecraft."

3045, "The GTC Fenris class is the aging stalwart among the Alliance's warships. Before the Great War, the Fenris was Terran Command's only class of cruisers. During the war, Terran Command decided to build a second line of cruisers, the Leviathans, to free the Fenris from escort and guard duties. Fenris cruisers have fought in virtually every theatre of operation. These fast, versatile cruisers pack enough punch in their 260-meter-long hulls to go toe-to-toe with any enemy cruiser. The Fenris's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for strike missions."

3046, "Terrans developed the GTM Hippocrates early in the post-war Reconstruction period. With the outbreak of the NTF insurgency, the GTVA has once again called the Hippocrates into active military service. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Allied-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach."

3047, "Early in the Great War, Han-Ronald engineers designed and built the Leviathan class of cruisers. The Leviathan is much heavier armed and armored than the Fenris, but also much slower and less maneuverable. Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations, where firepower is king and speed is of little importance. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. The Fenris is good for fast-moving operations, but when you need some muscle, call in a Leviathan."

3048, "The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines."

3049, "When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTVA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTVA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

3050, "Ships of the GTA Charybdis class have been packed with the latest tachyon-enabled AWACS equipment from GTVI labs. Each GTVA battle group has a squadron of Charybdis-class ships assigned to it. These ships double the range of the group's standard detection arrays. Charybdis ships' thin armor and weak defenses make them easy victims for enemy bombers. They have proven indispensable, however, in forays into the nebula beyond the Knossos portal. Charybdis-class ships are very vulnerable in this environment, as witnessed by the recent loss of the GTA Panopticon from the 3rd Battle Group."

3051, "For over 30 years, the GTD Orion class was the largest ship in the Terran-Vasudan armada. Over two kilometers in length, bristling with dozens of death-dealing turrets, the Orion is as awesome in repose as it is in battle. All GVTA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers. The Orion's cavernous hanger bays easily accommodate more than two dozen fighter or bomber wings."

3052, "The new GTD Hecate class of destroyers is replacing the Orion class as the flagship of Terran battle groups. More heavily armed than the Orion, the Hecate also carries over 150 combat spacecraft and a crew of 10,000. The GTD Aquitaine is a superb example of this new ship class, serving as the flagship of the Capella-based 3rd Fleet."

3053, "The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources."

3054, "The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

3055, "The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups."

3056, "Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet."

3057, "The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however."

3058, "The Iceni is the NTF command frigate, built under Admiral Bosch's direction at the Freedom shipyards in Polaris, captured by the Neo-Terran Front at the start of their rebellion.  With over two dozen turrets and a sheath of ultra-dense depleted uranium shielding around its subsystems, the Iceni is an extremely tough nut to crack. With Bosch on board, providing tactical guidance, the Iceni is the equal of any GTVA battle group. Intelligence believes the ship was custom-designed for a secret NTF project."

3060, "The GTT Elysium class of transports has been in service for over 40 years. Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class."

3061, "The GTT Argo has become the standard military transport vehicle for the Terran fleet. Argos sometimes carry new weapon and combat craft prototypes to and from testing grounds or to front-line deployment positions. Military VIPs occasionally commandeer Argos to travel from star system to star system in some semblance of comfort. Argos are most often used as assault transports, carrying squads of Marines through heavy flak to board enemy vessels that Command has decided to capture rather than destroy."

3062, "The GTI Ganymede is the Alliance's newest repair and resupply facility. Ganymede installations are currently deployed behind the front lines in the Vega, Vasuda, and Capella systems. Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTVA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

3063, "The subspace portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system in 2367. The interlocking circular motions of its components apparently create a subspace vortex that connects the Gamma Draconis system to another part of our universe.  Dr. Hargrove's team continues to study the device, though their findings are highly classified."

3064, "The GTSG Watchdog was the first generation of Terran sentry platform, the distant precursor to the Cerberus and Alastor platforms. Seriously underpowered by today's standards, the Watchdog also suffers from paper-thin armor. Many Watchdogs are Great War relics left active and in place because it wasn't worthwhile removing or deactivating them. The NTF occasionally uses stolen Watchdogs to guard supply depots or minor installations."

3065, "Until the advent of the GTSG Alastor, the GTSG Cerberus was the most advanced sentry gun emplacement available to Terran forces. They were vital to Terran defenses during the Great War, racking up over 100 kills of Vasudan and Shivan combat craft. But the current conflict has found them primarily in back-line roles, guarding installations deemed relatively safe from attack. With no mobility and only two Subach HL-7 turrets, they serve as more of a distraction than a viable threat to modern combat craft."

3066, "GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. Two Bessmer-Kohn cannon turrets on opposing sides of the platform give the Alastor a full field of fire. The turrets are controlled by the latest neural-net cyber-AI to track multiple targets simultaneously."

3067, "The GTEP Hermes escape pod is now standard equipment on every GTVA warship of cruiser size or larger. Each ship has several escape pods magnetically coupled to airlocks scattered around the ship's outer hull. Not intended for whole-crew evacuations, the Hermes has space for up to 20 crew members. Each pod is propelled by a small fusion engine, enough to remove the pod from the immediate vicinity of an exploding warship. It is also capable of subspace jumps."

Despite having only two primary and secondary weapon banks, the Serapis has been retrofitted to accommodate almost any loadout in the GTVA arsenal. Veteran Vasudan pilots love the Serapis for its agility and loadout options. Some Terran pilots who've been privileged enough to fly it claim to prefer it to any Terran fighter."

3098, "The GVF Tauret is replacing the Seth as the Vasudans' heavy assault fighter. While integrating cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with the Terrans, the Tauret boasts a distinctly Vasudan design. Its unusual configuration was inspired by the Apsu-Hek, a creature that once inhabited the deserts of Vasuda Prime. The Apsu-Hek has become an emblem of the Vasudan diaspora, and the Tauret continues the tradition of symbolic design. Armed with four gun mounts and two missile banks, the Tauret has the speed and firepower to challenge both fighters and warships."

The version currently in use was further modified by technicians at Mekhu Enterprises. Sporting four primary weapon banks and three missile/bomb bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch. Add in a top speed that surpasses that of some fighters and an ultra-dense molybdenum armor plating, and it's easy to see why the Sekhmet is the favorite bomber among Vasudan pilots."

It is showing its age during the current conflict, as the more advanced Bakha and Sekhmet bombers have replaced it on the front lines in most theatres of conflict. Osiris bombers still in service have been retrofitted to make them compatible with most GTVA missiles and bombs.

3116, "Learning a lesson from the bomber losses of the Great War, Vasudan defense contractor Akheton designed the GVB Bakha, a fast, agile bomber that could still deliver a warship-shattering payload. The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime."

3122, "The stealth prototype GVF Ptah was a top-secret development project assigned to Vasudan conglomerate Akheton Corp. Designed to be invisible to standard detection arrays mounted on combat craft, Ptahs have performed admirably during their OpEval period. The masking materials and blending technologies used across their outer surfaces seem to confuse Shivan detection systems as well. The Ptah is currently available only to select fighter units in the Vasudan navy, with no word on when they will be more widely distributed."

3123, "The GVS Nephtys is the Vasudans' new support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The high number of warheads carried by the Nephtys makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3124, "The GVT Isis is most often used as a military personnel transport but also occasionally serves as a repair ship or even a tugboat, helping to maneuver large vessels into docking bays. Two cannon turrets and thick molybdenum plating serve to protect its cargo. Magnetic cargo locks located on the Isis's undercarriage enable it to transport small cargo containers of supplies and munitions in emergencies."

3125, "The Ma'at freighter class has served the Vasudan navy for over 50 years. More than 200 of these vessels still serve the GTVA, carrying desperately needed supplies, foodstuffs, and munitions to every theatre of the war. With only three weapon turrets, a lone Ma'at is easy prey for a wing of enemy bombers. Thus Ma'ats usually travel in mixed convoys with other freighters, guarded by cruisers and fighter wings."

3126, "For the past 20 years, the GVFr Bes has been the mainstay of Vasudan shipping fleets. While some Terran systems languished in the post-war era, the Vasudans experienced an economic recovery that was miraculous, given the annihilation of their home planet. Experts credit the policies of the restored Imperial government that emerged following Khonsu II's dissolution of the Vasudan parliament. As commerce among the Vasudan systems resumed and expanded into Terran worlds, a new generation of space-faring cargo vessels was required to meet the needs of this burgeoning economy."

3127, "The Vasudan VAC 5 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3128, "The Vasudan VAC 4 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3129, "When the first Satis-class freighter was encountered by Terran forces during the Terran-Vasudan War, its firepower led Terran Command to classify it as a light cruiser. Only after a disabled Satis was captured did its true nature become known. Now designated the GVFr Satis class, these freighters still serve as an iron fist within the velvet glove of a freighter convoy. Few enemy fighters who mistake a Satis for a Ma'at or Bes live to regret their error."

3130, "The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet."

3131, "The GVC Aten is among the smallest of the GTVA's cruiser classes, with thin armor and only a few, relatively weak turrets. Terran fighters and bombers exploited these weaknesses during the early years of the Great War, when the Terrans and Vasudans were still enemies. The Aten is most often seen in the current conflict as a rear-guard defense for convoys or installations, backing up wings of fighters and bombers."

3132, "The GVC Mentu cruiser is the lightest of the new Vasudan warships. Following the Great War, allied scientists developed the beam cannons that now serve as the primary armaments of today's GTVA warships. Rather than modify existing ships, the Vasudans developed new designs to mount these weapons. The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi."

3133, "Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves."

3134, "The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice."

3135, "The GVSG Ankh sentry gun platform is the Vasudan equivalent of the GTSG Watchdog. Both are Great War relics that perform poorly by modern standards. The Ankh serves to guard back-line storage depots and installations. With no armor or shielding, the Ankh is easily destroyed. Its two small turrets can deter unarmed raiders or badly damaged fighters, but it poses little threat to most combat craft."

3136, "When the GTVA asked the Vasudan navy to upgrade the Great War-era Ankh sentry gun platform, the GVSG Edjo was the Vasudans' answer. The Edjo has significantly more armor plating than the Ankh, improving its survivability, but the Vasudans placed only one small cannon turret on the new platform, giving it half the punch of the Ankh. After seeing the Edjo, the Terrans quietly began developing their own advanced sentry gun platforms. The Vasudan navy seems content to leave this aspect of military technology to the Terrans."

3137, "The GVEP Ra escape pod has been the standard emergency vehicle on Vasudan capital ships since the Terran-Vasudan War. In keeping with Vasudan philosophies, the Ra is almost never used to evacuate personnel, but instead is employed to preserve records and other data that could be of use to the allies. Thus Ra-class craft have minimal life support systems and a small fusion engine. The energy supplied by the escape pod's powerplant goes almost entirely to powering the pod's homing beacon."

3138, "The GVA Setekh is the Vasudan class of AWACS vessels, comparable to the Terran GTA Charybdis class. Setekhs are smaller, less heavily armored, and have half the turrets of Charybdis ships. Despite these shortcomings, the Vasudan navy insists upon deploying Setekhs in Vasudan battle groups, claiming the Vasudan versions are more appropriate for their fleets. Setekhs' crystalline detection arrays provide their fleets with doubled radar range within the nebular region. Every Vasudan battle group operating in this theatre has a wing of Setekhs attached to it."

3139, "In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet."

3140, "The Shivan fighter class SF Dragon is a fast, extremely agile craft. Its twin lasers pack a deadly punch. The Dragon's weakness seems to be a thin hull. The trouble is that their speed and maneuverability make them extremely difficult to hit."

3141, "The SF Basilisk is a Shivan heavy attack fighter. Slow but heavily armed and well-protected, the Basilisk targets slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3142, "The Manticore fighter is the fastest known craft in the Shivan armada. With a single, powerful laser and two missile banks, it is a dangerous offensive weapon. Its Achilles' heel lies in its thin hull and weak shields. Manticores do not last long in dogfights against other fighters. They prefer to target bombers, which are nearly helpless against the Manticore's speed and weaponry."

3143, "The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3144, "The SF Mara class of Shivan fighters was first encountered by the GTC Vigilant while patrolling the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. All other information concerning the Mara is classified level Psi."

3145, "First encountered in Gamma Draconis, the SF Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly."

3146, "The SB Nephilim is the slowest of the Shivan bomber classes. These craft were first encountered during the Great War and are still found in many Shivan attack formations. Nephilims are heavily armored and shielded, enabling them to deliver their devastating payloads despite their lack of speed."

3147, "The SB Taurvi is a Shivan vessel that has only recently been encountered. The Taurvi is one of the weaker Shivan bomber classes, but still the equal of every bomber in the GTVA arsenal. Not as maneuverable as a Nahema, nor as tough as a Seraphim or Nephilim, the Taurvi appears to be a Shivan compromise between speed and power."

3148, "Either the SB Nahema class is a new Shivan bomber design, or the Shivans are finally taking the GTVA seriously and bringing in their best ships. The Nahema is considered to be the Shivan's most dangerous bomber. It has demonstrated the ability to outrun virtually every fighter in the GTVA fleet. Its powerful laser banks and high-capacity missile bays make it a threat to combat craft of all types, as well as to capital ships."

3149, "The SB Seraphim is a familiar foe to GTVA forces. They appear to be similar to Nephilims in speed, armor, and shield strength, but have demonstrated a larger bomb capacity."

3150, "Encountered on rare occasions since the Shivans first entered the Great War, the ST Azrael is the only known class of Shivan transport. Little is known about it even now, but it is believed to house many Shivans within its thin hulls. Since Azraels might be carrying Shivan pilots or other skilled crew members, it is always worthwhile to eliminate these lightly defended ships."

3151, "The SFr Dis class of freighters is smaller than the Asmodeus class and not as well armed. It is still much more dangerous to attack than the GTVA's Triton or Poseidon freighters, however."

3152, "The SAC 3 is the most common Shivan cargo container found thus far. Its thin plating is barely enough to maintain the interior atmospheric integrity against the vacuum of space. As no additional effort was made to armor these containers against attack, it is assumed that only items of low value or importance are carried within. Nevertheless, standing orders are to capture these containers at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3153, "The SFr Mephisto class is equivalent to the Dis class in size and combat capabilities. Given their wildly different configurations, they must serve different purposes for the Shivans, but Allied Intelligence currently offers no further information on this matter."

3154, "The SC 5 class of Shivan cargo container is functionally identical to the SAC 3 class, as far as GTVA engineers have been able to determine. As with all Shivan cargo containers, standing orders are to capture at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3155, "Little is known about the SFr Asmodeus line of freighters. With a strong hull and four weapon turrets, they are the most dangerous Shivan freighters to attack. Nothing is known of the cargo Asmodeus freighters commonly carry."

3156, "The SAC 2 is a heavily armored variant of the standard Shivan cargo container. Equipment found in captured SAC 2s appears to be more fragile than that found in the more common SAC 3s. SAC 2 cargo containers are to be captured rather than destroyed at every opportunity. If the choice is between destruction and allowing the container to be recovered by Shivan forces, pilots are authorized to destroy the container."

3157, "The SC Lilith class of Shivan cruisers is a far-deadlier foe than the Cain class. Nearly impenetrable armor plating enables it to withstand tremendous punishment, enabling its nine turrets to lash out at warships and combat spacecraft with impunity."

3158, "Though not as thickly armored as the Lilith class, the SC Rakshasa class of Shivan cruisers is far deadlier. With over a dozen turrets, the Rakshasa is the most heavily armed Shivan cruiser class. It was a Rakshasa cruiser that destroyed the GTC Vigilant at the Gamma Draconis node in the Capella system."

3159, "The weakest of the Shivan cruiser classes is designated SC Cain. These vessels were commonly encountered during Great War battles. Cains are considered to be slightly stronger than the GTC Fenris cruiser class."

3160, "The SD Demon class of Shivan destroyers is much smaller than the Lucifer class but very heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Demons are known to carry numerous wings of fighters and bombers."

3161, "The SD Ravana is a destroyer class GTVA forces have only recently encountered. It appears to be tasked with clearing out smaller foes, a mission for which it is well suited. It eagerly wipes out wings of fighters and bombers and also overwhelms cruisers and corvettes."

3162, "The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion."

3163, "The SSG Trident line of sentry gun platforms is well known from numerous encounters during the Great War. These are still used to guard Shivan installations, but many of the stronger Belial platforms have been deployed to the most critical defensive positions."

3164, "The SSG Belial sentry gun platform appears to be a radical redesign of the Trident platform that was first encountered during the Great War. Pilots who have encountered both report that the Belial is harder to kill. It is reliably known that the Belial has twice as many laser turrets as the Trident sentry gun. Both types are used to guard storage depots, gas miners, and other Shivan installations."

3165, "Almost nothing is known of the Rahu line of gas miners. It is assumed that they function in much the same way as our Zephyrus miners, funneling nebular gas into internal machinery that fractionates it into its molecular components for further processing. Rahu miners are armed with heavy laser turrets, so care must be taken when attacking them."

3166, "Only one class of Shivan ship is classified as a corvette - the SCv Moloch class. Though they're physically as large as the GTCv Deimos class, Molochs do not seem to pack the same punch. They are far more deadly than any Shivan cruisers, however."

3167, "Very little is known about the SJ Sathanas class. This juggernaut seems comparable in strength to the GTVA Colossus.  All intelligence concerning the Sathanas has been classified level Upsilon."

3184, "The Great War"

3185, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

>From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

According to declassified transmissions, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

3186, "Reconstruction"

3187, "By the end of 2335, the Great War was over. The victory over the Lucifer had dealt the decisive blow. Incapable of coordinated strikes or strategic planning, the Shivans were outmaneuvered, isolated, and gradually destroyed. However, both species faced the challenge of rebuilding their interstellar societies from the ground up.

An ill-fated coup d'etat, orchestrated by the rogue intelligence branch of the GTA, marked the beginning of post-war factional politics. With its economy in ruins and political structures in turmoil, the Galactic Terran Alliance disintegrated into semi-autonomous regional blocs, each with its own agenda. The major entities included the Adhara Coalition, the Antares Federation, the Regulus Syndicate, and the Luyten New Alliance. As these groups consolidated and stabilized, the reconstruction gained momentum, and the resumption of open commerce rekindled the notion of a pan-Terran community.

Despite the annihilation of all life in their home system, the success of the Vasudan reconstruction surpassed that of their Terran allies. The Vasudans were governed by a Parliament until 2339, when the Vasudan Emperor, Khonsu II, dissolved this body and formed a new government, bringing an end to an institution notorious for its Byzantine treachery, corruption, and arrogance. The heir of a 10,000 year dynasty, Khonsu distinguished himself as a leader of unusual acumen and wisdom. Economists credit the Khonsu regime for the miraculous rehabilitation of Vasudan industry and society."

3188, "GTVA"

3189, "The Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA) was formed in 2345, ten years after the Great War. This treaty organization recognized the autonomy of its constituents as it provided a framework for trade and mutual defense. The Great War had transformed the enmity between Terrans and Vasudans into a lasting fellowship.

As the industry and economy of the Terran-Vasudan systems recovered, support for a more powerful GTVA gained momentum. In 2358, delegates signed into existence the Beta Aquilae Convention (BETAC), named after the system where the constitution was drafted and ratified. BETAC dismantled the governments of the Terran blocs and recognized the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Vasudan Imperium as the supreme authorities of Terran-Vasudan space.

Under BETAC, the Vasudans and the Terrans maintain separate fleets under a single command structure. A warship is designated GT or GV, indicating whether it is Galactic Terran or Galactic Vasudan. The two species openly exchange information and technology, and the most recent fighters and bombers can be modified to accommodate pilots of either species.

Technically, BETAC is but one of a series of conventions and treaties that define how the GTVA functions as a political, military, and economic entity. However, the significance of BETAC as the cornerstone of the Terran-Vasudan alliance has made it the favored target of NTF propagandists."

3190, "Earth"

3191, "In 2335, the destruction of the Lucifer superdestroyer collapsed the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis, severing all contact with Earth.

The fate of the Terran home planet remains open to speculation, though a number of scenarios are possible. As the center of an interstellar community, Earth could not survive in isolation without a radical transformation of its political and economic structures. On this point, there is no disagreement. However, the question remains whether this transition occurred peacefully or whether Terran society collapsed into anarchy. Strong arguments have been advanced for both sides.

For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation-states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society.

Though necessity has diminished Earth's practical importance in the post-war era, discovering the means to return home remains a high priority."

3192, "Neo-Terran Front"

3193, "Eighteen months ago, Admiral Aken Bosch, commander of the GTVA 6th Fleet, launched a violent military coup in the Polaris system. Within weeks, a regional domino effect also toppled the governments of Regulus and Sirius, all swearing allegiance to Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front.

Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra informs the ideology of his movement. Though Terrans have lived in exile from Earth since the end of the Great War, Bosch imagined a utopia that would restore the grandeur of the lost world. As the people of Earth once relied on Polaris to help them navigate the seas, the North Star would become the spiritual and political compass for Terrans of the new era. Bosch's message had a profound impact on the so-called Lost Generation, born during the post-war Reconstruction. The Neo-Terran Front provided the youth of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius with a cause to fight and die for.

Bosch succeeded because his pro-Terran ideology was explicitly anti-Vasudan. The NTF opposed any Terran-Vasudan alliance and called for the dissolution of the GTVA. The NTF core systems had suffered political and economic chaos throughout the post-war Reconstruction. The Vasudans' miraculous recovery under Khonsu II's leadership embittered those Terrans still struggling to rebuild their own systems. Bosch exploited this anti-Vasudan sentiment to achieve his own political ends."

3194, "Vasudans"

3195, "The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. Thirty years of peaceful interaction between Terrans and Vasudans has helped to deconstruct these stereotypes.

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device is standard on all GTVA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other.

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War. After the defeat of the Shivans, the Vasudans insisted on maintaining this convention. The Emperor strongly identified with the history of Ancient Egypt, particularly the longevity of its civilization. Following their Emperor's example, Vasudans will take on what they call a Terran name from the myths and history of Ancient Egypt."

3196, "Hammer of Light"

3197, "The dark side of the Vasudan obsession with history was the emergence during the Great War of Hammer of Light (HoL), a cult that gained a strong following among the PVN, resulting in defections to the HoL cause. The HoL believed the Shivans were the cosmic redeemers and destroyers predicted in obscure prophecies written thousands of years ago. Following the destruction of the Lucifer, the ideology and activities of Hammer of Light shifted.

While some followers committed ritual suicide, the military branch of the movement continued their armed opposition to the Vasudan government and its alliance with the Terrans. Though they continued to espouse HoL's religious dogma, their activities turned more toward acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare. This branch of the HoL was later crushed in Operation Templar, following the HoL's kidnapping of the Vasudan admiralty. Other HoL leaders vanished into obscurity, returning to the study of arcane texts. A number of these religious leaders were apprehended and imprisoned for their role in the insurgency, though a few are still in hiding."

3198, "Shivans"

3199, "32 years after the Great War, we still know almost nothing about the Shivans. 

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and all research on live specimens ended with the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. The results of these studies remain highly classified.

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. The most convincing evidence supporting this theory is the behavior of Shivan forces following the destruction of the Lucifer, the turning point of the Great War. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date."

3200, "The Ancients"

3201, "During the Great War, as the annihilation of Earth seemed imminent, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization we now call the Ancients. Data excavated at the site enabled the allies to track and destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace.

After the Great War, scientists uncovered more sites throughout Terran-Vasudan space. Though only fragments remain, this interstellar society thrived thousands of years ago. Their empire was more expansive than the current boundaries of known space, and archeologists believe they might eventually uncover a map of the Ancient nodes, enabling the Alliance to travel to systems previously uncharted. 

There is virtually no visual record of this civilization, except hieroglyphic forms discovered at the archeological sites and a handful of technological schematics. Major excavations are underway in Altair, Aldebaran, and Deneb, but the data gathered there remains classified at the highest level. 

Terran archeologists use a Minoan naming convention to identify sites and major artifacts. Current evidence suggests the Shivans exterminated this civilization over eight thousand years ago. The Ancients believed the Shivans were a race of cosmic destroyers, and that the extinction of their species was an act of retribution for striving beyond their ordained place in the cosmic order."

3202, "Subspace"

3203, "In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

3394, "GTM-13 Helios"

3395, "The GTM-13 Helios is the product of an entire generation of high-energy physics research, based primarily at the GTVA particle accelerator complex near Antares. The most powerful warhead in the fleet's arsenal, the Helios generates a massive shockwave from the cataclysmic annihilation of matter and anti-matter, triggered upon impact with its target. Each bank of Helios warheads can fire only once every 30 seconds. The Helios is prohibitively expensive to produce, thus its deployment is severely restricted."

3396, "GTM-14 EMP Adv."

3397, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse Weapon
General Purpose Suppression"

3398, "GTM-14 EM Pulse Adv."

3399, "The GTM-14 Electromagnetic Pulse Advanced warhead interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within its blast radius. This renders the affected ships unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock. Tactically, the GTM-14 is a very effective anti-bomber weapon, as it also temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight. This advanced version of the standard EM Pulse missile disrupts subsystems at a deeper circuitry level, resulting in a longer-lasting effect."

3400, "GTM MX-52"

3401, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

3402, "GTM MX-52

Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel based targets."

SPIELEN
  Startet das Spiel FreeSpace 2


SETUP
  Öffnet den Setup-Dialog, der wiederum in Grafik, Audio, Joystick,
Geschwindigkeit, Netzwerk, DirectX und Sonstiges eingeteilt ist.
"

3404, "
  * Grafik - Sie müssen eine 3D-Grafikkarte besitzen, um FreeSpace 2
spielen zu können. Sie können das Spiel nach Glide- und Direct3D-
kompatiblen Karten suchen lassen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im Interlaced-Modus abspielen' - Hierbei werden die
Bilder in zwei Durchgängen gezeichnet, damit langsamere Grafikkarten
damit zurechtkommen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im FastClear-Modus abspielen' - Durch FastClear
werden die Einzelbilder der Animationen direkt aufeinandergezeichnet,
ohne dazwischen den Bildschirm zu löschen. Das kann auf manchen Karten
einige Flackereffekte verhindern.
     - 'Niedrige Direct3D-Texturdetails' beschleunigt das Spiel, indem
weniger Texturdetails verwendet werden, was natürlich dann in einer
schlechteren Grafik resultiert. Deswegen sollten Sie diese Option nur
dann aktivieren, wenn Sie während das Spiel oft stockt oder langsam
läuft.
     - 'WFOG erzwingen' - WFOG, eine Direct3D-Option, ist eine alter-
native Art, Nebeleffekte anzuzeigen (durch feste Tabellen statt
mit Vektorangaben). Manche Karten unterstützen WFOG nicht korrekt 
(z.B. die S4-Karte), deswegen ist die Option normalerweise deaktiviert.
Sie können aber gerne damit experimentieren.
     - 'Direct3D ZBuffer Bias deaktivieren' - Wenn Sie Direct3D
verwenden und Probleme beim Rendern der Geschwader-Logos sehen (die 
Logos überdecken alles andere), sollte diese Option den Fehler beheben.
"

3405, "
  * Audio - FreeSpace 2 unterstützt DirectSound, A3D und EAX. Sie können
einen dieser Standards auswählen, nachdem Sie auf 'Verfügbare Soundkarten
suchen' klicken und dann die gewünschte Soundkarte in der Liste
aussuchen. Ausserdem können Sie die Soundeffekte des Launchers hier ein-
und ausschalten.

  * Joystick - Hier können Sie Ihren Joystick für FreeSpace 2 einstellen.
Wenn Ihr Joystick Force Feedback unterstützt, kompatibel zu DirectX 6.0,
können Sie diese Option hier aktivieren.

  * Geschwindigkeit - Hier stellen Sie die Detailoptionen
für neue Piloten ein. Wir möchten darauf hinweisen, dass die 
Spielgeschwindigkeit deutlich beeinträchtigt werden kann, wenn Sie
diese Option höher als empfohlen setzen.

  * Netzwerk - Hier stellen Sie die Eigenschaften Ihrer Netzwerkhardware
ein, wie Geschwindigkeit und Art der Internetverbindung (falls
vorhanden). Sie können ausserdem hier Ihr PXO-Login eingeben, falls Sie 
sich bei diesem Internetservice eingetragen haben, oder einen
anderen Port erzwingen (Standard: 7808). Die 'PXO Banner' beziehen sich
auf den PXO-Chatscreen und zeigen, wenn aktiviert, Banner von guten
FreeSpace 2-Webseiten an.

  * DirectX - Hier wird Ihre DirectX-Version getestet. Es wird Ihnen
auch die Möglichkeit geboten, von hier aus DirectX zu installieren oder
zu aktualisieren.

  * Sonstiges - Hier können Sie sich noch die Sprache für das Spiel 
aussuchen. Einen Überblick über die möglichen Startparameter, die Sie 
in der Befehlszeile eingeben können, finden Sie in der README.TXT-Datei.

3412, "We have just received a communication from Admiral Bosch. His orders are for every $f NTF battle group to send half its strength to the Deneb system immediately. There's an offensive planned and Bosch wants to gather forces before striking. Our group will send the three warships you helped us capture in your previous mission."

3422, "As members of an NTF battle group, you encounter a Vasudan destroyer and must destroy it. Multiplayer mission. Max respawns 5.  Recommended respawns 3."

3423, "We have the $h GVD $h Chnum trapped in the Beta Aquilae system. It is accompanied by the $h GVCv $h Naunet. We are not sure how many fighters remain to defend the $h Chnum. Be prepared for the worst."

3424, "You destroyed the Chnum but the Naunet survived. We're fighting for our very existence here, pilots. We can't afford to let opportunities like these slip through our fingers!"

3425, "Take care of your primary objective quickly so that you have enough resources to handle secondary and bonus objectives."

3426, "Tremendous work! You destroyed both the Chnum and the Naunet. This is a major loss to the GTVA and a major victory in our battle for freedom."

3427, "You destroyed all the escape pods, ensuring that no Vasudan officers escaped. A most impressive effort, pilots!"

3428, "You destroyed the Naunet but the Chnum survived. You failed in your primary objective. We're fighting for our very existence here, pilots. We can't afford to let opportunities like these slip through our fingers!"

3429, "Take care of your primary objective first, then go after secondary and bonus objectives."

3433, "The GVD Chnum is going down!"

3434, "The Naunet has been destroyed."

3435, "That was an excellent display of teamwork out there today, pilots! You took on superior forces and defeated them all. You are to be commended for your skills and courage."

3436, "You destroyed the Nosferatu and the Barqu, but the Sathariel escaped. You accomplished your primary objective, but you must strive to eliminate all Shivan forces encountered. Every foe that escapes could mean dead GTVA pilots later."

3437, "You destroyed the Nosferatu and the Sathariel, but the Barqu got away. You accomplished your primary objective, but you must strive to eliminate all Shivan forces encountered. Every foe that escapes could mean dead GTVA pilots later."

3438, "You destroyed the Nosferatu, but the Barqu and Sathariel got away. You accomplished your primary objective, but you must strive to eliminate all Shivan forces encountered. Every foe that escapes could mean dead GTVA pilots later."

3439, "Destroy Barqu"

3441, "Destroy the Demon"

3442, "Destroy the Rakshasa"

3443, "We have detected unknown jump signatures approaching, they are probably Shivan.  Stay alert."

3444, "Heads up, pilots! The Barqu is now approaching your position. Eliminating that destroyer would be a major boost for your careers."

3445, "Alpha, the Sathariel, a Rakshasa-class cruiser, has just jumped in. Let's take it out!"

3446, "Great work, Alpha! That's one fewer cruiser the Shivans have to throw at us."

3447, "<put description here>"

3448, "Destroy Chemosh"

3449, "Destroy Rahab"

3450, "Destroy Chamos"

3451, "The corvette Chamos has just jumped in. Stop it before it reaches the node to Epsilon Pegasi!"

3452, "The Chamos has been destroyed! Great work, pilots."

3453, "Another Shivan corvette, the Rahab, is now entering your area. Get rid of it quickly, pilots!"

3454, "The Rahab is down. Good work so far, but stay alert. Your patrol's not over yet."

3455, "The Shivans are sending in a destroyer, pilots. The Chemosh is now approaching your position. Good luck!"

3456, "Excellent work, pilots. Ensure that the area is secure and then return to base."

3457, "The NTD Alsace, an Orion-class destroyer has arrived."

3458, "The Alsace has been wiped out. Great work, pilots!"

3459, "The Alsace has jumped into subspace. That'll mean trouble for our troops on Sirius III."

3460, "A Hecate-class destroyer, designation NTD Corsica, has just entered your area."

3461, "The Corsica has been destroyed. Well done!"

3462, "The Corsica has escaped. Try not to let any more through, Alpha!"

3463, "Corvette Rescue"

3464, "Rescue a damaged GTVA corvette in the nebula in the face of stiff Shivan opposition.
"

3465, "I'll be brief, pilots. We've just received word that the corvette Bretagne has been found in the nebula. As you may have heard, this ship was assumed destroyed by the Shivans just before our battle group returned to Gamma Draconis."

3466, "As Command just discovered, the Bretagne was damaged and its communications and engine systems were knocked out, but she's still alive. They've repaired most of the damage and have called for an escort out of the nebula."

3467, "The Bretagne is trying to reach the Gamma Draconis jump node but has encountered resistance. You're being sent in to eliminate that resistance. We want you to clear a path for the Bretagne, concentrating on bombers and fighters. Be on the flight deck in five minutes, pilots. Good luck!"

3468, "Despite your efforts, the Bretagne and all her crew were lost, pilots. You were sent in with sufficient strength to escort her through the Shivan forces, yet you failed. This will be a permanent stain on your records. Dismissed."

3469, "Communicate with your teammates. Coordinate attacks to take out bombs and bombers before they damage the Bretagne."

3470, "That was well done, pilots. The Bretagne and her crew are now safe, thanks to you. The Shivans lost a cruiser, a corvette, and several wings of fighters and bombers. All in all, a fine day's work!"

3471, "You escorted the Bretagne back safely, pilots, but the Sargatanas escaped. When the opportunity presents itself, we need to eliminate every Shivan capital ship we encounter. You did well today, but there's room for improvement."

3472, "As bombers and fighters are eliminated, one or more of your team should concentrate on the Sargatanas, as that presents the greater threat to the Bretagne."

3473, "Do not leave the field of battle before receiving clearance from Allied Command."

3474, "Destroy Rakshasa"

3475, "Destroy Moloch"

3476, "Protect Bretagne"

3477, "Destroy Shivan Corvette"

3478, "Thanks for the escort, jump drive engaged."

3479, "Alpha and Zeta wings reporting for escort duty, Bretagne. What's your status?"

3480, "We are under attack and need immediate assistance. Get these Shivans off us!"

3481, "Great work, pilots! We are heading toward the Gamma Draconis jump node. Please provide escort."

3482, "Alpha, get those bombers!"

3483, "Alpha, the Shivan corvette Sargatanas has just arrived. You must protect the Bretagne at all costs!"

3484, "Hull breach is imminent. We need more cover, Alpha!"

3485, "The Bretagne has been destroyed. This mission is over, Alpha. Return to base."

3486, "Good job, Alpha! Return to base."

3487, "To Destroy or Not To Destroy"

3488, "This mission is an all out assault on a Shivan destroyer.  It has been designed to see some massive beam weapon exchange, and to protect a bombing wing so it may assist in destroying a capital ship."

3489, "All right pilots, listen up.  We have been selected to implement a special attack on a Lucifer Class destroyer designated the $h Hamtek.    It will free up an extremely important jump node necessary for supply runs in this sector."

3490, "Command has decided to use a 'Hit and Run' tactic against the destroyer to reduce the amount of damage taken by our ships.  The Hades Class destroyer $f Eblin will jump in and take out the communication and navigation subsystems on the $h Hamtek.  That way, it can't call for reinforcements or jump out of system."

3491, "Once the $f Eblin has destroyed its targets, it will then jump out and be followed by the $f Borealis.  The $f Borealis will take out the sensors and weapons subsystems on the $h Hamtek.  Once those systems are destroyed, the $f Borealis will jump out and make way for the next capital ship."

3492, "Your job will be to take out the fighters guarding the $h Hamtek.  They must be destroyed as quickly as possible to make way for our bombers to jump in. $f Alpha will command the mission and will be flying the advanced heavy fighter, the $f GTF $f Erinyes.  "

3493, "Once all the fighters are eliminated, $f Delta will jump in to take out the reactors on the $h Hamtek.  As soon as $f Delta arrives, they will focus their fire on the reactors.  At this point, your first priority are those reactors.  Make sure $f Delta gets cover from any fighters that arrive so they can take down those reactors.  The reactors must be destroyed so the Lucifer destroyer will go critical and be destroyed."

3494, "The $f GTC $f Rambler will follow the $f Borealis to distract the $h Hamtek's fire away from $f Delta wing.  $f Zeta will be available if you need reinforcement bombers.  This mission is top priority.  Let's get it done pilots.  "

3495, "Good work, pilots.  With the destruction of the Hamtek, our supply runs through this jump node can resume.  Supplies through this node were especially important for many of our capital ships, including the Colossus, hence it's importance to High Command."

3496, "We are saddened by the loss of our friends on the Borealis.  There was nothing you could do to prevent it's destruction.  The officers of the Borealis were prepared to give their lives for the future of the GTVA.  Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.  Have a good rest, pilot.  You deserve it."

3497, "This is horrible, pilot.  You and your wings had sufficient firepower to destroy the Hamtek.  We lost the Borealis destroyer with nothing to show for it.  It will be awhile before you are on anymore high priority missions.  Dismissed."

3498, "Tell your wingman to guard Delta Wing.  Driving the fighters away from Delta while destroying them gradually is more important than destroying each right away and forgetting the others.  Keep an eye on the Mara class fighters."

3499, "Destroy Edrogen"

3500, "Destroy Manti"

3501, "Destroy Kantara"

3502, "Destroy Sepharum"

3503, "Destroy The Hamtek"

3504, "We've done our damage pilots.  The next ship is on it's way.  See you back home."

3505, "A new wing of Mara Class fighters have arrived.  They're going after Delta wing.  Alpha and Beta, destroy those Maras!  Do not let them attack our bombers."

3506, "It looks like the Shivans have caught onto our plan of attack.  The Hamtek is focusing its fire on the Borealis."

3507, "This is the Borealis.  We're being hit pretty hard.  We're readying our jump drives.  We'll try and hold the Hamtek until we jump out."

3508, "We've lost the Borealis.  Resistance is higher than expected.  We can't afford to send in anything else.  It's up to you now, pilots.  Call in Zeta if you need more bombers."

3509, "Both bomber wings have been destroyed! We have no remaining firepower, Alpha!"

3510, "Good work pilots.  Mission accomplished.  Return to base."

3511, "This is the Eblin.  Our engines are down, but our chief engineer thinks he can get them back up enough to jump out.  Standby."

3512, "Ok pilots.  Our engines are back up and we are readying our jump drives."

3513, "Alpha, Delta wing has sustained 50% casualties.  Give them cover fire!"

3514, "Alpha, Delta wing has been destroyed.  You must call in Zeta to finish this mission.  Don't fail, pilot."

3515, "Crisis in Capella"

3516, "Alpha must escort two GTVI transports safely to the Gamma Draconis node.
"

3517, "You have been chosen for a special assignment in the Capella system. Shivan forces have engaged a convoy of transports, operating under the command of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. The Alliance has deployed the GVD Psamtik to assist, but the destroyer will require several minutes to reach Capella. In the meantime, we need you to protect the convoy. "

3518, "This convoy consists of two transports, the Deliverance and the Stevedore. The GVC Adamant is their only escort. Details of this operation are to be released on a need-to-know basis, and the cargo on board these transports is classified Level Upsilon. Ensuring that these ships reach the jump node is your primary objective."

3519, "The Shivans have deployed the SCv Balam and the SC Armaros. Do not engage either of these warships. The Psamtik will contend with them upon its arrival. Be sure to give both ships a wide berth. Their beam cannons and flak guns could easily vaporize your fighter."

3520, "Your directives are clear and we expect you to follow them. Eliminate enemy bombers first, then destroy the fighters. Maintain close proximity to the convoy. We must get those transports to the jump node. All other objectives are secondary."

3521, "Excellent job, pilot! Intelligence reports the transports arrived safely in the Gamma Draconis system. 

As a result of your outstanding service to the Alliance, I am recommending your transfer to the GTD Aquitaine, flagship of the 3rd Fleet. Should you undertake this assignment, you will serve on the front lines of our war against the Shivans, fighting to secure peace for all systems of the GTVA. 

Completing this campaign will not be easy, pilot. You must acquire mastery of the fighters, bombers, and weapons in our arsenal. You must venture into the nebula to uncover its secrets, and confront the most powerful adversary we as a civilization have ever faced. You'll work hand-in-hand with our Vasudan allies, and maybe even command one of their squadrons. If you succeed, you will have the satisfaction that you helped secure the future of humanity and our place in the cosmos. "

3522, "You escorted one of the transports safely to the Gamma Draconis system. Considering what you faced out there, that's not too bad.

Allied Intelligence has called for a formal inquiry into the loss of the other vessel you were assigned to protect. However, had they done a better job anticipating the extent of the Shivan attack, we would have been better prepared. Only a top-notch pilot could have repelled all those bombers. You did what you could, and Command will stand by you.

The road ahead will not be easy, pilot. We are fighting the most powerful adversary we as a civilization have ever faced. We must work hand-in-hand with our Vasudan allies, and if we succeed, we'll know that we helped secure the future of humanity and our place in the cosmos. "

3523, "Target incoming bombs with the B key, and stay close to the convoy. Do not let the Shivans lure you away.  Ignore the Balam. Focus on the transports as your highest priority.  Remember to issue orders to your wingmen appropiate to the changing situation."

3524, "Allied Intelligence has demanded a formal inquiry into the loss of its convoy. Though their recon units failed to anticipate the full extent of the Shivan attack, as leader of Alpha wing, you must accept your share of the blame. 

Command will go on record that only a top-notch pilot could have repelled all those bombers. You did your best, and we will do all we can to stand by you. 

Nevertheless, I regret to inform you that you will be grounded pending a preliminary hearing. You are dismissed, pilot."

3525, "Target incoming bombs with the B key, and stay close to the convoy. Do not let the Shivans lure you away.  Ignore the Balam. Focus on the transports as your highest priority."

3526, "Do not leave the field of engagement without authorization from Command. Even if the area seems secure, it is important that you follow Standard Operating Procedures."

3536, "Alpha, this is the Adamant! The Armaros is down, but the Balam remains at full strength. The Shivans are launching bombers now."

3537, "OK, we're on it, Adamant. The Psamtik will be here momentarily. We'll keep them covered until help arrives."

3538, "Alpha wing, the Deliverance and Stevedore must make it through. Intercept those bombers!"

3539, "We'll keep the Balam busy. You keep the bombers away from the transports."

3540, "This is the GVD Psamtik. We are ready to engage and will now activate main batteries. All allied fighters, stand clear of the Balam."

3541, "Focus on the Nahema bombers, Alpha! If you can't stop them, intercept their warheads! "

3542, "Reinforcements are standing by. Call them in at your discretion."

3543, "Adamant here. Hull integrity is dropping. If we don't get help soon, we're not gonna make it!"

3544, "The Balam has been eliminated. "

3545, "Good work, pilot. Return to base."

3546, "The convoy has entered the jump node. A job well done, Alpha! Help the Psamtik secure the area."

3547, "Seraphim bombers have emerged near the jump node! Destroy them now, Alpha!"

3548, "We'll keep the Balam occupied. You keep the bombers off our transports."

3549, "Transport is down! Repeat! Transport is down! Stay focused, Alpha! We can't lose the other one!"

3550, "The Shivans have destroyed both transports! Abort mission, pilots! Return to base."

3551, "Alpha, you're falling behind the convoy. Hit your burners to catch up!"

3552, "Stay close to the transports, Alpha. Get them safely to the node!"

3553, "Alpha, you're too far from the convoy! "

3554, "Alpha 1, your job is to protect the transports. Return to the convoy on the double. "

3555, "There's nothing more we can do here, pilot. Return to base."

3556, "Protect the transports, Alpha. Keep the bombers away from the convoy!"

3557, "Alpha, defend the convoy! They must reach Gamma Draconis!"

3558, "More bombers incoming, Alpha! We're almost there! Hold them off just a little longer!"

3559, "You have completed the demo campaign.  You may replay it at a higher skill level by creating a new pilot or you may try the multiplayer missions."

3560, "This is the Deliverance, we are about six clicks from the Gamma Draconis node."

3561, "The convoy has reached the three kilometer mark, we are getting closer."

3562, "We are almost on top of the node."

3563, "Steveadore here, we are approximately six kilometers away from the node."

3564, "Destroy Cambyses"

3565, "Destroy Akhenaton"

3566, "Calm before the Storm"

3567, "With the NTF's surprise offensive at hand, Admiral Bosch retrieves several important documents from an installation in Vega."

3568, "Neo-Terran Front

Welcome to the Neo-Terran Front, pilot.  I am the leader of this secret faction, Admiral Aken Bosch.  With your help, we can bring back the former glory of Earth and make Polaris the new beacon of light for all of humanity.

However, the GTVA does not recognize this glory and BETAC prevents us from having authority in this sector.  Therefore, to make our voices heard, we will renounce the treaty and we will claim our territory by force."

3569, "Coup at Polaris

With the GTD Vindicator and the GTCv Belisarius secretly joining our ranks in the recent weeks, we are ready to formally declare our independence.  The time to throw down our disguises is upon us.

Our first thrust into the GTVA will be the new capital of the NTF, the Polaris system."

3570, "NTF offensive

With 93% of the 6th fleet poised to join our ranks and a small fleet of other rogue vessels pledging their loyalties to my cause, I am ready to unveil the tactics to take over the nearby systems.

In five hours at 0600 standard Earth time, The GTD Julius commanded by Admiral Edith will lead a fleet of nine warships and 32 squadrons of fighters.  The fleet will annex the Installation orbiting Polaris 3."

3571, "Ground assault

With the orbiting platform seized, ground forces from cities under NTF control will lead a surprise assault on the rest of the planet.  With the GTVA caught totally unaware, the whole ordeal should only last several hours at most."

3572, "Aftermath

With the Polaris system under NTF control, I will lead the rest of the fleet on a two pronged strike of of the Sirius and Deneb system, thereby solidifying the NTF's power in this sector.

Once these three systems and their respective jump nodes are secure, we will be in an adequate position to take on the GTVA forces."

3573, "This is Commander Morgan of the NTF squadron the 36th Vipers.  The admiral wants to get something from Wayfarer Station in $b Vega before the $f GTD $f Julius begins the attack."

3574, "The admiral fears that command is on to him and therefore will need our help.  $f Alpha and $f beta wings will escort Bosch's transport, the $f GTT $f Echo to the station under the guise of loyal pilots."

3575, "If the station prevents the arrival of the $f Echo, you are to abort the mission and guide the $f Echo through the $b Deneb $b Jump $b Node."

3576, "If the station prevents the departure of the $f Echo, you are to disable the communications array of the station, which will prevent the station from calling its fighters while the $f Echo destroys the docking clamps.  After that, the $f Echo will make its way to the jump node."

3577, "If any additional resistance shows up, the admiral will have backup standing by."

3578, "Your loadout has been preset to handle the possible conditions that may occur.  However, you will have a couple of weapons in your arsenal, including the $b Akheton $b SDG $b disruptor and prototype $b tornado $b swarm $b missiles stolen from a research station in Altair.  You will be the first pilots to use such an advanced weapon so we hope you will use it to your advantage."

3579, "Pilot, you abandoned your post in the line of duty.  Because of your cowardice, we must regretfully hold a tribunal for your actions.  You will face the NTF council tomorrow at 0930 hours to face your punishment."

3580, "Never leave your post unless instructed to by a superior officer."

3581, "Congratulations, soldier.  With your skills as a pilot, you and the rest of our forces managed to escort the admiral out of Vega with the files he needs.  Now that the admiral has these up to date fleet deployment reports and other high level classified information, we will swiftly take over Polaris and the surrounding star systems.

"

3582, "Your unprovoked attack on the station was uncalled for.  Fortunately, the Admiral made it safely back to the fleet for our next engagement in Sirius.

"

3583, "With the destruction of the GTT Echo and the death of Admiral Bosch, the NTF stands little chance of gaining sovereignty from the GTVA.

Although the GTD Julius is likely to capture Polaris with ease, the strike on Deneb and Sirius has been cancelled due to this unfortunate turn of events.

"

3584, "You managed to destroy every hostile that came in your way. Good work, pilot."

3585, "The loss of the NTC Moray was tragic.  However, her crew's deeds and unfaltering loyalty will never be forgotten."

3586, "You will join Admiral Bosch's command fleet onboard the GTD Agamemnon in seven hours to begin the liberation of Sirius from the GTVA."

3587, "Good work, pilot.  We have no recommendations for you."

3588, "Our fleet is fortified at Polaris for the GTVA offensive, you are to report to patrol duty onboard the GTC Zora in three hours where you will do no additional harm to the NTF."

3589, "Protect the Echo by destroying incoming bombers and by disabling the Dahshor's turrets.  It is also important to save your wingmates from enemy fighters, they will help you intercept vessels attacking the Echo."

3590, "You, on the other hand will face the NTF council for your incompetence in the field of duty and for disobeying orders of superiors.

Report to the conference room of the GTD Agamemnon tomorrow at 0900 hours for judgement and punishment."

3604, "Yes, sir.  The topside docking port is open.  You are cleared for docking."

3605, "Thank you, station control.  Bosch out."

3606, "Admiral, I'm afraid you cannot leave.  Command has just ordered us to prevent your transport from leaving the station.  We're sending security teams to escort you out."

3607, "Alpha wing, you know what to do, switching IFF status of the station.  Remember, do it quickly."

3608, "Alpha squadron, this is station control.  What are you doing?  Cease fire immediately."

3609, "This is Alpha 2.  I'm afraid not, Command.  We fight for the Neo-Terran Front!"

3610, "Good work, Alpha wing.  Now let's jet before the cavalry arrives.  Severing docking latches now."

3611, "This is the GTC Vigilant.  All GTVA fighters, disable the Echo and its fighter support.  Don't let them get to the Polaris Node.  We will try to intercept them."

3612, "First objective completed.  Let's sit and wait."

3613, "This is the Admiral Bosch from the Echo.  Permission to depart."

3614, "This is the NTC Moray along with Sigma and Gamma wings.  Admiral, we're ready to fight for the Neo-Terran Front."

3615, "Damn, they've disabled our vessel.  Activating secondary systems.  Just cover us until we get them back on."

3616, "Oh great, there's a cruiser there to spoil the fun.  Alpha and Beta, you've got your work cut out for you if anything happens."

3617, "This is Captain Tamel of the GTC Vigilant.  Power down your weapons and surrender to the GTVA or be destroyed,  this is your final warning."

3618, "So be it. All vessels, you have authority to destroy the GTT Echo.  I repeat, you may destroy."

3619, "I have already made my decision, Captain.  No one is going to stand in the way of the NTF."

3620, "There's a Sobek class corvette jumping in.  It's the Dahshor.  She's trying to block the jump node.   Alpha, try to disable the Dahshor's turrets."

3621, "We took some engine damage, but we're activating backup systems."

3622, "The Moray's destroyed.  Let's not make their deaths be in vain."

3623, "Alpha, hurry up and destroy that communications array.  They've sent fighters."

3624, "Oh my god, we're going down!  Bosch is dead!  All pilots, get out of here!"

3625, "They don't think much of us, the Dahshor's beam weapons have been destroyed.  They sent a dud after us.  Alpha, show them what you've got."

3626, "Alpha, what on earth are you doing?  Hurry up, station security's almost through the doors."

3627, "Alpha, they've captured us, it's over for you."

3628, "Thanks, Alpha.  Warp out and meet us at the predesignated coordinates."

3629, "The GTC Vigilant has fled the battlefield.  There's one less cruiser to worry about."

3631, "A Revelation leads you to join The NTF.  You now must stop Admiral Petrarch by Whatever Means possible. - x2
"

3632, "Welcome to the $g Neo-Terran-Alliance, pilots.
   
It is good that you have finally seen through the deceptive propaganda of the power mad leaders of the $r GTVA."

3633, "We have good reason to believe that in order to secure $r their positions of power, high level $r GTVA $r officials are exchanging sensitive technical data with the $r Shivans."

3634, "$r Admiral $r Petrarch is one such official.

With our limited resources, $g we could never hope to defeat the $r Colossus, but $g we have found a way to stop him."

3635, "There is an inconspicuous and highly secret convoy which is making its way to a rendezvous with  $r Admiral $r Petrarch for a surprise birthday party."

3636, "On board this ship is $r Admiral $r Petrarch's  6 year old grandson, and he is being flown in especially for this occasion.   "

3637, "In order to maintain their secrecy, they will be following a little known and poorly travelled route.

This pathway will take $r them through two very remote $b Jump $b Nodes, the $b Psychros and the $b Xiphos."

3638, "You must destroy the $r Bartizan's communication subsystem and engine systems promptly so that they cannot call for help or escape.

You will then need to begin work quickly on the turrets and weapons so that our $g boarding $g party can approach and dock."

3639, "Our transport, the $g Menelaus will dock with and board the $r Bartizan.

We have operatives on board already who will assist, but only after the $g Menelaus has successfully docked."

3640, "Keep a close eye on the $r Bartizan.  We believe that $r she has sufficient maintenance materials and tools so that $r she will be able to make many repairs in the field."

3641, "You managed to disable the comm subsystem promptly - good work, pilot."

3642, "Still, the Bartizan was able to call for help. This is not acceptable."

3643, "Keep the comm sytem down."

3644, "The Menelaus was lost.  We can only hope that our operatives on board the Bartizan were not discovered."

3645, "You protected the transport so they could dock and take the child hostage.  Good work."

3646, "The Menelaus and all its contents were lost. We cannot afford blows such as these to our cause."

3647, "It is not clear how this happened, pilots, but the Menelaus and our hostage were both lost.  Would Petrarch sacrifice his own grandson?"

3648, "The Bartizan was destroyed -- this will surely create some interesting consequences for the GTVA."

3649, "Despite our loses, it appears that we have succeeded thus far.  The hostage was captured. We will have a little surprise for the good Admiral on his birthday.

In the meantime,  you are being recommended for the Red Coyote Squadron - Congratulations, pilots."

3650, "We could not permit the Menelaus to be captured. This circumstance is unfortunate, at best."

3651, "Protect the Menelaus."

3652, "I hope you noticed the fighters that arrived prior to your departure.

Any doubts you had about the veracity of our claims should be now laid to rest.  The Shivans were flying with the GTVA."

3653, "Pilots - you abandoned the field of engagement without an order to do so."

3678, "The Package has been taken. Return to base."

3679, "Bartizan is calling in help, watch out!"

3680, "The Bartizan is repairing its communications system!"

3681, "The Menelaus has been lost. Return to base."

3682, "Get out, pilots, quickly! We cannot afford to lose ships like this! Return to base now!"

3683, "Pilots! The GTVA Ships are attempting to disable the Menelaus -- Stop them!"

3684, "The Menelaus has been disabled. I suggest you leave now, pilots."

3685, "The Menelaus has been disabled!  We cannot permit her to be captured."

3686, "We copy that, Command.  It is in hand -- beginning countdown.    5---4------3-------2-----"

3688, "Excellence Under Fire"

3689, "A strike against a Shivan Cruiser and  Cargo Depot"

3690, "Scout fighters from the 21st battle group located a Shivan Cruiser, the $h SC $h Lemures, at 0600 yesterday."

3691, "We believe the cruiser is low on supplies, as it has stopped to reprovision at an isolated depot. This provides us with an excellent opportunity. We will eliminate the cruiser and capture the cargo depot in a single strike."

3692, "The 21st has committed the $f GVC $f Menes, a Mentu class cruiser, to the attack on the $h Lemures, but the 21st is short of fighters at the moment, due to heavy combat over the past 48 hours."

3693, "As such, we have been asked to provide fighter support for this mission.  Alpha wing will provide fighter cover for the $f Menes as it engages the $h Lemures.
"

3694, "When the $h Lemures has been eliminated, mop up any remaining Shivan presence, and return to base."

3695, "You did not have permission to return to base pilot.  The GTVA has no place for pilots who ignore their orders. Consider yourself grounded until further notice. Dismissed."

3696, "Do not return to base until ordered to do so."

3697, "Congratulations on a job well done, Pilot. The Lemures has been neutralized, and our operations in this sector can continue as planned."

3698, "Unfortunately, the GVC Menes did not survive the confrontation, turning this into a rather Pyrrhic  victory.  While the attack by the Shivan bomber wing was unexpected, you should have been able to protect the Menes until help arrived."

3699, "When the Menes jumps in, it has Shivan bombers in hot pursuit. Neutralize these bombers and their warheads to increase the Menes chances for survival."

3700, "The GVC Menes survived the engagement, but experienced heavy damage. It will take some time before she is battleworthy again."

3701, "Intercept the bombs launched at the Menes, and destroy the main beam turrets on the Lemures to lessen the damage inflicted on the Menes."

3702, "The Menes survived the battle with only moderate damage. Good work in protecting her."

3703, "The unfortunate loss of the GTC Gallant and her crew is a blow to us all. We shall honor the memory of the Gallant and her crew."

3704, "Try to destroy the main beam turrets on the Lemures to lessen damage to the Gallant."

3705, "Some of the cargo was lost in the engagement, but much of it survived.  Freighters are retrieving it as we speak."

3706, "Try to lead the battle away from the cargo depot."

3707, "Unfortunately, a significant quantity of the cargo depot was destroyed in the fighting. Still, the remainder should prove valuable."

3708, "We cannot afford to lose opportunities to collect cargo.  While the containers were secondary to this operation, our pilots need to be able to sieze these opportunities when they arise."

3709, "Protecting the cargo containers was crucial, and a wing of freighters is retrieving what they can as we speak.  Additional supplies are always beneficial to our cause."

3710, "You brought all of your wing back alive. Excellent work.  Concern for one's wingmen is a mark of all good flight leaders."

3711, "This mission was a total failure.  We lost two cruisers, and the Lemures remains a threat to our operations in this sector.   A full investigation into who is at fault is already underway. You are grounded until further notice. Dismissed."

3730, "There's the Menes! It's about time you got here!"

3744, "$f GTC $f Eris, on a routine patrol near the planet $b Epsilon $b Eridani $b VI, has stumbled across something interesting."

3745, "$h SC $h Greyface, a Rakshasa-class cruiser, lies disabled near the gas giant.  The cruiser appears otherwise undamaged, so we assume the problem is some sort of drive malfunction.  It will probably not be trivial to repair, as the Shivans have taken the trouble to deploy sentry guns."

3746, "$f Eris, an old Fenris, is far outclassed by the modern Shivan warship, so we dare not close to within beam cannon range.  We have called for help from any GTVA ships in the area, and fighters have been trickling in.  Shivan reinforcements may arrive at any time, though, so we cannot afford to wait any longer."

3747, "We will proceed with the three wings that have arrived.  $f Gamma will take point, engaging the sentries and any enemy fighters.  $f Beta wing will press the attack, with $f Alpha providing cover.  Once $h Greyface's hull has been reduced to 50 percent, $f Eris will move in for the kill."

3748, "Excellent work!  With the destruction of Greyface, we're one cruiser up on the Shivans."

3749, "The initial results from the Kallisti beam inhibitor project are promising.  GTVA Command plans to manufacture more of these units.  With luck, our scientists will be able to devise a way for our own beam weapons to fire while the Shivans' cannot."

3750, "Greyface escaped.  This defeat is made all the more painful by the loss of GTC Eris."

3751, "Race to attack ST Gehenna as soon as it appears."

3752, "We took down Greyface, but our own heavy casualties make the victory a Pyrrhic one."

3753, "If you can destroy Greyface's beam cannons, GTSC Kallisti can turn off the beam inhibitor.  GTC Eris can then dispatch the Shivan cruiser with impunity."

3754, "You left the mission area before being cleared to do so!  Desertion is a capital offense, Pilot.  You are grounded pending a court-martial."

3765, "We're going to need more firepower.  Even another cruiser would be enough..."

3766, "GTSC Kallisti here.  We're on our way to help."

3767, "A science cruiser?  It's not much, but we'll take what we can get."

3768, "Well, we have a little surprise on board.  We'll tell you more when we get there and can set up a secure channel."

3769, "Good to see you, Kallisti.  Secure channel established.  Now what's this surprise you're carrying?"

3770, "It's an experimental beam weapon inhibitor.  Unfortunately, it will shut down your beam cannons, too..."

3771, "Go for it!  We'll have much better odds with beams out of the equation."

3772, "Roger, Eris.  We'll activate the inhibitor as soon as we're within 3 kilometers of Greyface."

3773, "Activating beam inhibitor now."

3774, "All craft, engage!"

3775, "A Shivan transport has arrived.  It's a good bet they're carrying replacement parts for Greyface."

3776, "All fighters, destroy that transport before it docks!"

3777, "Greyface's beam cannons have been destroyed.  Good work, pilots!"

3778, "Shutting down beam inhibitor now."

3779, "They've destroyed the science cruiser!"

3780, "We've lost Eris!"

"

3785, "Welcome to the Stingrays

This is Commander Degas.  As leader of the respected 97th Stingrays here aboard the GTD Mandrill, I'm pleased to welcome you into our squadron.  The Stingrays are just one of 20 squadrons stationed aboard this vessel, which includes such notable squads as the 128th Sharks and the 84th Orcas.

We are confident that you will uphold the stringent code of honor that dictates our conduct.  Welcome aboard, pilot."

3786, "Distress Signal

Unfortunately, your stay will not be a long one.  Merely 10 minutes ago, we received a distress signal from the new Vasudan destroyer and our sister ship, the GVD Nekhbet.  The transmission follows..."

3787, "> Transmission from GVD Nekhbet
> 1058 hours, General Vasudan Military Time

<Begin transmission>

This is the GVD Nekhbet.  During a system diagnostic test, we encountered a problem with our main reactor.  The reactor malfunctioned and it caused our engines to completely shut down.  This has also rendered our beam weapons and other defensive mechanisms off-line."

3788, "<Transmission continued>

Just a few moments ago, a Shivan scouting wing encountered our disabled vessel.  Unfortunately, our minimal defenses were unable to neutralize all targets and some escaped.  We fear that they will bring reinforcements.

For now, we are running on our third backup generator that keeps our communications system operational.  We need assistance.  GTVA Command, please respond..."

3789, "Pilot, you are that response.  This is a situation that could turn critical without prompt action.  Therefore, we are dispatching Alpha and Beta Wings of the Stingrays to assist and defend the Nekhbet.

Suit up.  Mission briefing commences in five minutes."

3790, "At roughly 1100 hours, the $g GTD $g Mandrill received a distress call from the newly commissioned Hatshepsut destroyer, the $g GVD $g Nekhbet.  A reactor malfunction has rendered the Nekhbet defenseless and immobile.  It is also believed that the Shivans now know of the Nekhbet's status."

3791, "The Vasudans are unable to get a reinforcement fleet into the area in time.  Therefore, we are dispatching $g Alpha and $g Beta $g Wings to secure the area around the Nekhbet and defend it from any and all hostiles."

3792, "We will also send in an Argo transport, designated $g Omega, to dock with the Nekhbet and attempt to repair its reactor.  The crew of the Omega will first try to restore the ship's defensive array and then its engines."

3793, "Lastly, we have ordered the $g GTCv $g Echelon to be on standby elsewhere in the Vega System.  This is all we can do until Vasudan reinforcements arrive."

3794, "In the event of any unseen problems that threaten the Nekhbet, you are to await further orders from Terran Command.  We anticipate a Shivan offensive, but the size and power of their attack is unknown."

3795, "The 8,100 Vasudans aboard the Nekhbet are counting on you, pilot.  Do not let them down.  Good luck.  Commander Degas, out."

3796, "As Commander of the Stingrays, I officially annul all of your designations and awards.  Your membership with the Stingrays has been terminated, if not your entire career.  Desertion from any scenario without the consent of your commanding officer is punishable by a court martial.

This behavior is intolerable, pilot.  I am ashamed that I brought you aboard our squadron in the first place.  In our quest to become the most respected squadron aboard the GTD Mandrill, we have no use for cowards like you."

3797, "Do not leave until told to do so by your commanding officer."

3798, "Marvelous work, pilot.  The captain and crew of the GVD Nekhbet owe you and your wingmen their lives.  Your skillful defense of their disarmed and disabled vessel not only protected them from a heavy Shivan bomber onslaught, but also an entire Shivan destroyer."

3799, "Thanks to your efforts, the Shivan destroyer Karikeya will no longer pose a threat to future Alliance military operations.  She has been a persistent problem in this region of space, but this proved to be her final battle.

As a squadron, excellent work.  I would have expected nothing less.  Now, kick back and enjoy yourselves in the lounge of the GTD Mandrill.  You've earned it."

3800, "The Vasudan destroyer Nekhbet was decimated along with its crew of eighty-one hundred.  While the odds were against you from the very beginning, this loss is truly unacceptable.  The Nekhbet was on its way towards a defensive operation in another region of Vega, one which threatened the Azul Dawn Scientific Installation.  As of fifteen minutes ago, we lost all contact with that installation."

3801, "If there is one saving grace to your dismal performance, it is that the Shivan destroyer Karikeya was annihilated.  However, this was not before she took down the newest Vasudan capital ship with her."

3802, "You are dismissed."

3803, "Do your best to take down all Shivan bombers, including the Nephilims and Nahemas.  Leave the Karikeya to the ships with beam weapons."

3810, "Thank you for arriving, Stingrays.  We are under attack by a Rakshasa cruiser and two Shivan Wings.  Weapons and engines are off-line."

3811, "Beta Wing, focus your efforts on taking down the Shivan cruiser.  Alpha Wing, intercept the bombers in Taurus Wing and destroy their fighter escort."

3812, "Acknowledged, Command.  All wings, break and attack!"

3813, "We have neutralized the Shivan cruiser Savitar."

3814, "Both of the Shivan Wings have been neutralized.  Good work, pilots."

3815, "We are sending in an Argo transport to repair your ship, Nekhbet.  Please standby."

3816, "Acknowledged, Command."

3817, "This is Omega.  We are commencing docking procedures now.  Prepare to dock, Nekhbet."

3818, "Sealing the docking portal now..."

3819, "Okay, we are docked with the Nekhbet.  We're going to assess the damage, Command."

3820, "Acknowledged, Omega.  Please keep us up-to-date."

3821, "Nephilim bombers have targeted the Nekhbet.  Intercept and destroy, pilots!"

3822, "This doesn't look good, Command.  All reactor fuses are totally blown.  It'll take a good five or six minutes to fix this..."

3823, "You heard what the man said, pilots.  We've got to buy them more time.  Defend the Nekhbet."

3824, "Basilisk fighters on approach vector."

3825, "Command!  A Ravana-class destroyer has just warped into the area.  Designation, Karikeya.  Situation critical!  Command, advise!"

3826, "Stay calm, pilot.  We're sending in the GTCv Echelon now."

3827, "This is the GTCv Echelon.  Engaging the Karikeya.  All turrets, open fire!"

3828, "Aeshma fighters and Nahema bombers are emerging from the docking bay of the Karikeya."

3829, "Omega, we need those weapon systems back on-line now!"

3830, "Affirmative, Command.  We're almost ready... we have got the sensors, navigation, weapons, and reactor systems all temporarily back on-line..."

3831, "'Almost' will not cut it... the Nekhbet will be torn apart by that Ravana!  Can you attempt to fire a test shot?"

3832, "That we can do, Command.  Okay, we are ready to open one beam cannon.  If this works, we will open all of them."

3833, "Turret 3, open fire!"

3834, "Your repairs have worked, Terran.  All turrets, open fire on the Karikeya."

3835, "That should buy us some time.  Heading down into the engine room..."

3836, "This is the GVCv Selket, along with Delta and Epsilon Wings."

3837, "It's about time you guys showed up!"

3838, "Engaging the Karikeya."

3839, "We have fixed the engines on the Nekhbet.  Undocking now..."

3840, "Thank you for your help, Terrans.  GVD Nekhbet, out."

3841, "Great work, pilots.  You are cleared to return to base."

3842, "Only a few more Cyclops bombs should take out the Karikeya!"

3843, "Karikeya objective neutralized.  Brace for explosion!"

3844, "Hull has reached seriously low levels, pilots.  Please provide cover."

3845, "Hull is at critical level!  We need defense!"

3846, "The Nekhbet has been destroyed!"

3847, "There is nothing of value left to protect.  Return to base."

3848, "Pilots, continue to attack the Karikeya... this sortie is not over yet!"

3849, "Alpha and Beta, continue to focus your efforts on those bombers!"

3850, "Commencing engine repairs now.  Estimated time of completion, one minute thirty..."

3851, "One Step Too Far"

3852, "The GTD Voyager and the 347th GBH Squad assault an NTF base.
"

3853, "$b GTD $b Voyager
$b Command $b Briefing
$b 347th $b 'GBH $b Squad' $b in $b attendance:

Pilots, I have grave news. 6 hours ago, an $h NTF destroyer exited subspace near the $f Patterson $f Installation. Our forces were caught unaware, and a massacre ensued. The hostile destroyer was eliminated, at the loss of the $f GTI $f Patterson, the $f GVC $f Miracle, the $f GTCv $f Retriever, and over 30 $f GTVA fighters and bombers."

3854, "$b <continued>

In better news, Command has finally made the decision I'm sure you want to hear. I quote:

'The $h Neo-Terran $h Front has gone one step too far this time. Over twenty thousand people were serving aboard the $f Patterson $f Installation alone. It is time the $f GTVA stands up to $h Admiral $h Bosch, and delivers a few heavy blows of it's own!'"

3855, "$b <continued>

In light of this announcement, we are at last taking action. The $f GTD $f Voyager is set to launch a heavy assault on an $h NTF base in Polaris. The $f 347th $f GBH $f Squad will lead this assault.

Report to mission briefing in ten minutes, pilots. We're nearly in position. 

$b Dismissed."

3856, "As you have been informed, we are preparing to mount an assault on a nearby $h NTF base of operations. The $f Voyager and the $f 347th will lead this attack. We have already taken up position in Polaris, and are preparing to jump to the location of the base.

Note that there are no Vasudans involved in this assault. Command has made this decision because the relations between us and them are strained enough right now, thanks again to the NTF. We are hoping that this operation will go a long way to resolving this."

3857, "The $h NTF base consists of the $h NTI $h Lexington, the $h NTM $h Ketracel, five $h Mjolnir class $h Sentry $h Guns (Remote Beam Cannons), and a large complement of fighters and bombers. Quite deadly."

3858, "Your primary goal is to eliminate all $h NTF ships in the vicinity."

3859, "Target the $h NTM $h Ketracel first, as it is heading for the Jump Node."

3860, "Once it has been eliminated, target the fighters and bombers. Protect the $f Voyager while it assaults the $h Lexington."

3861, "There are also ten $h cargo $h containers in the battlefield area. Scan them if you can, but destroying them is your next priority."

3862, "Long-range sensors have detected several clusters of $h hostile ships scattered around this system. It is a fair assumption that these ships are able to act as reinforcements for the $h NTF, and so you may encounter many waves of resistance. All should be eliminated. "

3863, "$f Delta wing are standing by as reinforcements if required. The $f GTCv $f December is also prepared to enter, but will only be sent in if the need arises.
$f Omega and $f Epsilon wings of the 199th will also be made available, if the $f December decides to authorize them."

3864, "A final note: due to hostile interception of a supply convoy, your selection of ships may be limited to some of the older GTVA technologies. They should suffice for this mission, but be extra careful.

Good luck, pilots. We'll see you when you get back."

3865, "Excellent job destroying all the NTF hostiles, pilots. Thanks to your perseverance, we have dealt the rebels a punishing blow. Their forces in this sector have been decimated by this attack, and I'm sure that will be reflected in any future attacks they may stage. Nice job."

3866, "Well, you managed to destroy all the NTF with the exception of the Ketracel. Fortunately, Iota wing of the 43rd 'Da Bomb' squad caught up with that straggler after it exited subspace. It was eliminated. We can't afford to leave behind survivors on raids like this one, pilots. Next time, it could cost us a lot more."

3867, "The Ketracel starts the mission en route to the node, so it has to die quickly. However, Beta Wing are already on the case. Just let them do their job, and there shouldn't be a problem."

3868, "In addition to this excellent performance, you managed to save the GTD Voyager. Considering the overwhelming odds you faced out there, this was a major achievement. The more destroyers we have, the better our chance to resist future incursions into our territory. Well done."

3869, "However, even in light of this, the GTD Voyager was destroyed. I suppose you could say that the crew's lives were not sacrificed in vain - after all, we did manage to take down a major NTF base of operations. Try explaining that to ten thousand grieving families."

3870, "The biggest threat to the Voyager are NTF bombers. Take them down before they enter range, and shoot down their warheads if thet get a chance to fire. After they are down, concentrate on other threats."

3871, "Saving the GTCv December showed that you are truly one of the GTVA elite. The corvette was equipped with only a skeleton crew, able to evacuate at a moment's notice, but you were able to save them. We never expected to have this ship back, yet we do. Great work."

3872, "Even though the Voyager was lost, the December survived. Not really comparable in number of lives saved, but at least we managed to show the NTF who is superior here."

3873, "The GTCv December was, unfortunately, destroyed. In light of all your other success this mission, this loss was minor. However, even the most minor loss of life is still a blow to the GTVA."

3874, "By the time the December enters, most of the sentries should be gone. Try taking down bombers before they can fire on the corvette."

3875, "The GTCv December was destroyed. This failure, combined with the loss of the GTD Voyager, is unacceptable! You are hereby grounded until further notice. A formal reprimand will be entered onto your record. We expected more from you, pilot."

3876, "By the time the December enters, most of the sentries should be gone. Try taking down bombers before they can fire on the corvette. If the Voyager is lost, the December really MUST be saved."

3877, "The data on project ETAK that you discovered was unfortunately lost. The cargo containers did not even leave the battlefield. We really could have done with that data, pilots. "

3878, "When you detect ETAK data, the freighters are dispatched. Assign a wing to guard them, if you can spare the ships. Now would be a good time for reinforcements."

3879, "The GTFR North made it safely back to GTVA space. Unfortunately, the GTFR South was lost in battle. I hope the data we did retrieve is of use to us. It will, at least, justify the loss of all hands on the South."

3880, "Assign some guards to the freighters once they have collected the cargo."

3881, "The GTFR South returned safely to GTVA space. Unfortunately, we lost the North in battle. Hopefully, one cargo container is all we need to decipher Project ETAK."

3882, "The GTFRs North and South returned safely to GTVA space. Unfortunately, they were ambushed by the NTC Vortex shortly after exiting subspace. Both freighters were destroyed, and their cargo vaporised. At least we tried, pilots."

3883, "There was nothing you could have done to save the freighters after they left the battlefield."

3884, "You did NOT have authorization to return to base, pilot. Disobeying direct orders is a Class 1 offence, punishable by a full court martial."

3885, "Don't leave until you have completed the mission."

3947, "Sorry sir. Engaging now!"

3948, "GTVA pilots, this attack is futile! Cease fire now and we may allow you to leave this system alive! Continue... and you will all die."

3955, "$b Personal $b Log: Governor Raymond Francis M'kembe
$b Date: November 13, 2372

It has been just over five years since the largest exodus humanity has ever seen. Towards the end of the $r Neo-Terran $r Front rebellion, an ancient portal was discovered in the $g Gamma $g Draconis system. It had been activated by the $r NTF, opening the doorway to another confrontation with the $r Shivans. 

In our arrogance, we thought we had learned from our experience thirty-two years ago."

3956, "The prophets cried out, warning us of doom on the horizon. We ignored them, believing the lie that we had made for ourselves. The lesson, like the universe, was harsh, and we had forgotten it. We forgot that we had paid the price with our homeworlds. We were cut off from $g Sol and $g Earth, $g Vasuda $g Prime had been laid waste. Scattered across many systems, our colonies became our havens, because we had little choice. Terran, Vasudan, we walk amongst the cold space between the stars as exiles, looking for a place where we might find comfort, solace, and most of all home."

3957, "We learned the lesson again with $g Capella, a place I once called home. When the Shivans came again, we fled our homes with a hope that we could soon return. We hoped that the GTVA would stop them. Yet after a short-lived victory, we saw our place in the universe. The Shivans tore through our defenses as if they were paper, batting us aside as if we were nothing but a minor annoyance. In efforts to save the rest of our colonies, the jump nodes were collapsed, and the Shivan advance stopped at $g Capella. 

Yet I am left to wonder. I look at the starfield from here at $g Altair, the glow of the star I was born under. We are exiles once again."

3958, "In all, there were some two hundred million of us cast out of Eden to walk amongst the stars. We look for a place to call home. Many resent us, because the strain on the GTVA economy has thrown us into a new depression. The Vasudans have been kind, showing us a hospitality that we never expected. The wounds of the $b Terran-Vasudan $b War still run deep, it has been heartening to discover their honor and their trust. Yet perhaps they have more in common than we once thought, for they too are exiles, having a deeper understanding of what it is to never return home. 

R. F. M'kembe
Governor of Capella (in Exile)
$b End $b of $b log..."

3959, "It has been one week since the jump corridor between $g Tau $g Sigma and the $g Altair system was quarantined under provisions from the Beta-Aquilae Securities Act. Any discussion on this matter is $r classified. Travel in this subspace corridor is strictly prohibited, even to $f GTVA personnel. As such, all members of the $g 212th $g Silver $g Scythes present in $g Altair have been temporarily assigned to the Vasudan Installation, $g GVI $g Luxor."

3960, "The $g GVI $g Luxor is a decommissioned Vasudan $g Typhon class destroyer combined with a $g Ganymede docking ring. It serves its purposes well and is a very flexible design. 

While the $g Luxor's fighter complement can be that of a fully operational destroyer, they are operating at approximately half-strength. Since your stay in $g Altair is for an unspecified time, your skills will be put to use. While assigned to $g Luxor Station, you will be assigned to fly patrols and escort duty alongside your Vasudan colleagues."

3961, "In spite of the closure of the jump corridor, $g Capellan refugees have begun to arrive in the $g Altair system. In all, some one million refugees are expected to pass through here in the coming weeks. 

Leading the way is the $g GTM $g Alexis, a medical frigate carrying $b Governor R.F. M'Kembe. "

3962, "As soon as the Alexis arrives, the Governor will be making his way to the $g Luxor to meet with the local Vasudan Commander and a delegation from $b Morgan $b Technologies, who have sponsored the bid of the $g Capellan refugees for a new home in the $g Tau $g Sigma cluster. 

$g Alpha Wing, you are charged with ensuring security in the area. You are responsible for not only the Governor's safety, but for the $g GTM $g Alexis and the rest of the refugee fleet. "

3963, "$g Delta Wing is flying patrol around $g Luxor Station. They are under your command if you need assistance with the convoy. The $g GVCv $g Qualmotep is also on active duty near the station. 

In an emergency, $g Beta Wing is also on standby as the refugee fleet approaches. They will only be launched at the discretion of $g Luxor station. "

3964, "We do not know what potential security threats exist. However, there are several pirate groups in operation in these outer systems. They have been plaguing $g GTVA security forces significantly over the past few months. $b Morgan $b Technologies is one of many voices claiming that the $g GTVA does not have the ability to maintain security in this region. 

Keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. With the Governor's arrival, it is very possible that one of these pirate groups may attempt some kind of raid. Good luck pilot!"

3965, "If any security threat was perceived before, now it has become critical. Pirates operating with fighters, bombers and even a small cruiser is one thing, yet for this group to be this well armed indicates something much deeper and dangerous."

3966, "It seems that Kappa wing had access to GTVA clearance codes in the system. This is a serious breach of security. Their iff appeared as friendly so that they could approach the convoy unmolested. Fortunately, with you and Alpha 2 flying escort, you were able to pick up on the situation before they could carry out their orders."

3967, "Additionally, the docking bays of the GVI Luxor were sabotaged by a substantial explosion. In so doing, the Governor's Shuttle was stranded outside the station during the firefight, leaving it vulnerable to a kidnap attempt."

3968, "Governor M'kembe was kidnapped by an Elysium class cargo transport that appeared while all of our fighter wings were tied down in battle. We had warning, pilot, you could have prevented this."

3969, "As soon as you receive word that the Sneak has arrived, disengage from the main battle and rescue the governor. You will need your afterburners, missiles, and guns."

3970, "Governor M'kembe's shuttle was damaged and subsequently destroyed from the shockwave of the exploding Sneak. You exercised poor discretion pilot,  a kidnapped governor is better than a dead governor. 

You, on the other hand will be facing disciplinary action for reckless conduct in combat. "

3971, "Once the Sneak gets too close to the Capellan Shuttle, destroying it will destroy the Governor's craft. You will have to move quickly once the Sneak arrives to destroy it a good distance away from its intended prey. "

3972, "Congratulations Pilot, you managed to thwart an attempt to kidnap Governor M'kembe. Your quick action and adequate response has prevented what could have been a serious incident. "

3973, "The death of Governor M'kembe is unacceptable.  His leadership will be sorely missed. We expected better from you, pilot. Your poor conduct has not only seen the death of a well respected leader, but has endangered the secure future of millions of lives. "

3974, "The GVCv Qualmotep was destroyed in the firefight. Her loss is a substantial blow to security in the area. "

3975, "The bombers pose a serious initial threat to the Qualmotep, as does the Ithaca. Try to take out the bombers quickly, as well as the Ithaca beam cannons."

3976, "The Ithaca Deimos-class corvette represents a substantial security threat in the area. While it was driven off, we are going to have to take some steps to track it down. "

3977, "We were fortunate that the GTFf Cypher was in the area, and helped drive off this pirate attack. However, details of their presence in the system is classified. You are not to discuss this matter, even amongst your wingmates. "

3978, "Unfortunately, the food convoy fell under attack on the way to their station. The loss of this part of the convoy is serious enough that we will have to look at alternative means of feeding the Capellan Refugees."

3979, "The GTM Alexis was destroyed enroute to Luxor Station. We are more than disappointed pilot. Over 3,000 lives were lost when she went up. This will be reflected on your permanent record. "

3980, "The GTM Alexis successfully made it to her rendezvous point. As flagship of the Capellan flotilla, she will hold position at Luxor Station to supervise the operation. Hopefully, the quarantine of the jump node will be short lived, and the Capellans will be able to establish a new home. "

3981, "Regardless, the situation has now become serious enough that the GTVA is mobilizing its fleets to deal with the security threats in this region. We are going to have our hands full over the next few weeks, pilot."

4070, "The GVD Hedetet, the flagship of the Vasudan battlegroup occupying Antares, has finally been located.  The Vasudans are concentrating their forces and making a run for Vasuda.  Show them how it's done.
"

4071, "Our scouts have finally located the GVD Hedetet, the flagship of a rebel Vasudan battlegroup occupying Antares.  The Hedetet is a Typhon-class destroyer, escorted by two light cruisers and a Sobek-class corvette."

4072, "Apparently, the rebels are concentrating their forces and proceeding to Vasuda.  Whatever operation the renegades are planning, we cannot allow the GVD Hedetet to participate.  We have only a small window of opportunity before other rebel capital ships join the battlgroup."

4073, "Terran forces elsewhere are unable to assist in this operation.  The Antares-Beta Cygnia jump node must be secured and a blockade is being formed at the Antares-Vasuda jump node.  All we have available for this operation are three wings and a single cruiser."

4074, "The GTC Knight is a specially-equipped Deimos-class corvette designed for quick strikes against enemy capital ships.  Her experienced crew assure me they can distract the rebels long enough for this mission to succeed.

Alpha Wing will be outfitted in heavy bombers, while Beta and Gamma Wing provide a fighter escort.  "

4075, "If your initial strikes are unsuccessful, additional wings will be sent as reinforcements.

Your main objective is to destroy the GVD Hedetet.  The other capital ships are not a priority.  See that the destroyer never makes the blockade of the jump node.  If that cannot be done, do as much damage as possible and we'll finish her off at the blockade."

4076, "Excellent work, pilot.  Your squad was able to destroy the GVD Hedetet before the GTCv Knight received severe damage.  Intelligence analysts were uncertain the assault could be completed with such little damage."

4077, "Congratulations, you exceeded expectations."

4078, "Good job, pilot.  The task force was able to destroy the GVD Hedetet.  However, the GTCv Knight received severe damage and will be in repair for the next few weeks.  Intelligence analysts predicted that the assault would result in heavy damage to the GTCv Knight, but we could not allow a rebel Vasudan destroyer to leave the system."

4079, "Don't worry, there is little more you could do."

4080, "What went wrong, pilot?  You failed to destroy the GVD Hedetet.  Our only consolation is that the GTCv Knight was not severely damaged.  The assault has failed and Intelligence analysts predict that we will be unable to prevent the destroyer from joining the rest of the rebel forces and breaking through to Vasuda.  We don't know what they're planning, but I'm sure that we will find out soon."

4081, "Concentrate your attack on the GVD Hedetet.  Once you destroy the Hedetet, then you can retreat."

4082, "This mission was a complete failure.  Not only did you fail to destroy the GVD Hedetet, but the GTCv Knight was severely damaged.  Intelligence analysts predicted that the assault should have either destroyed or disabled the rebel Destroyer.  The blockade will not be able to prevent the rebels from combining their forces and breaking through to Vasuda.  We don't know what they're planning, but I'm sure that we will find out soon.  Without the GTCv Knight in action to respond, I think we're in serious trouble."

4083, "Concentrate your attack on the GVD Hedetet.  Destroy enemy beam turrets to reduce the damage to the GTCv Knight."

4084, "We lost the GTCv Knight during the battle.  Their sacrifice will be remembered."

4085, "Fighter wings are needed to defend the GTCv Knight from enemy bombers and fighters."

4086, "You were able to destroy the GVC Harginn."

4087, "The GVC Chaggrin could not escape the battle."

4088, "The GVCv Cambion will not be able to reinforce the other rebel Vasudan forces."

4110, "Roger that command.  Warheads are armed and ready."

4111, "Watch the friendly fire! You get hit, you won't make it to your own service!"

4112, "Avoid the beam and you won't get hit, pilot."

4113, "Good luck, pilots. Keep a tight formation and look out for each other.  Let's all get home alive."

4114, "Yes, sir."

4115, "The Trap"

4116, "Called to the SOC once again, you realise the war isn't over yet, but it soon will be."

4117, "Special Operations Command Briefing 08:00

Welcome back to the SOC, pilot. I am Commander Dobson, acting head of Tactical. We needed someone good, and according to Lieutenant-commander Snipes' report, you're the best we have.

Please note that this briefing is classified level Rho."

4118, "The GTVI and SOC have set up a trap for the rogue Shivan warships that escaped from Vega just before Capella went supernova. Ships and weapons are in short supply, so we must take every advantage we can. Sadly, your choice of loadout is severely limited. We have only managed to scrounge up some Taurets and Myrmidons. I hope you've had some experience with Vasudan fighters."

4119, "The GVD Kortan has on board a new class of weapon which generates an unusual subspace pulse for 10,000 clicks around. This has two uses. Firstly, it blows the reactors of any small Shivan ships caught in the pulse's inner radius. Secondly, it acts as a lure. For unknown reasons, this type of pulse seems to attract Shivan warships to its source. Scientists hypothesize that it may act as a fake distress signal, but the Shivans aren't usually that compassionate. Whatever it does to the Shivans, we just know it works.

Be careful, Alpha. The Kortan contains the only prototype of the weapon in existence. If it is destoyed, years of research will be lost."

4120, "We have set up a defense grid consisting of several Mjolnir sentry guns, hidden from the enemy by AWACS. When the Kortan initiates the subspace pulse, another ship, the GVA Galadriel, will divert the path of incoming warships into our trap using a powerful artificial graviton beam. This actually diverts the path of incoming ships through subspace disruptions. The Galadriel will also be hidden from the enemy.

The Kortan can help take down the larger destroyers when it is in place."

4121, "Special Operations Command, in association with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence, has set up a trap for Shivan warships who escaped from the recent battle at Vega. This will make the upcoming cleanup operation much easier and save many lives."

4122, "We have set up an impenetrable line of defense consisting of several Mjolnir sentry guns. They will be invisible to enemy sensors due to high-level AWACS coverage. They should be safe from the Shivans. After all, what you can't hit what you can't see."

4123, "The GVD Kortan has on board the subspace weapon. Your main objective is to protect the Kortan at all costs. If that ship goes down, the mission will be an utter failure. Don't worry, the Hecate class can deal with almost any threat."

4124, "Before the Kortan activates the weapon, you and Beta wing should clear the area of all hostiles. Should any survive, they could bring reinforcements and ruin our veil of secrecy. If that happens, you will be held responsible for the consequences."

4125, "If all goes well, the SD Achronox should break off its attack on the GTCv Nomad and the GVD Nendru elsewhere in the system and fall into our trap. If we're lucky, more warships will follow their lead. All will be destroyed before they realize what's happening Good luck pilot, we're counting on you."

4126, "Well done, pilot. The GTVI has announced that the trap was an official success, and thanks you for your part in setting it. All Shivan warships in this system have been obliterated, and Special Operations Command has announced the deployment of more subspace lures throughout GTVA systems. Now a final victory is in sight for the GTVA.

"

4127, "There are no recommendations."

4128, "You were chosen for this assignment because you are the best. It seems we were wrong about you. The Shivans continue to bombard our battered fleet and we face many casualties before they are stopped. Our hopes have been dashed once again, and even our elite pilots were unable to complete simple tasks."

4129, "Try an easier difficulty setting."

4130, "The loss of the Ganymede means that the Shivans know of our plans. Though today's operation stopped several warships, further operations will not be possible."

4131, "Get to the Ganymede quickly, and remember where the enemy fighters appear."

4132, "The Kortan has been lost, and with it go 10,000 lives and the subspace weapon. We may never have the chance to rebuild it."

4133, "Watch for enemy bombers and disarm the Genris."

4134, "Protecting the Kortan was vital to the success of the mission. Your role in this outcome will be documented."

4135, "The effectiveness of your protection of the Ganymede will be noted in your record."

4142, "Secure the area, Alpha wing. The Shivans cannot disrupt this operation!"

4143, " Get over to the Kortan, Alpha. They need fighter cover."

4144, "This is the Kortan. The subspace weapon is still charging. We can't commit energy reserves to anti-fighter beams."

4145, "A wing of Nephilims has jumped in. Protect the Kortan, pilots, it's a sitting duck!"

4146, "A Demon-class destroyer, designation Genris, has arrived. Alpha, take down its forward beam turrets, now!"

4147, "We are now diverting backup generators to main beam weapons."

4148, "Quickly, Kortan, initiate the subspace pulse."

4149, "Done, Command. All the fighters have been disabled or destroyed."

4150, "The SD Achronox, a Ravana class destroyer, has fallen into our trap!"

4151, "The SD Aggressive has broken off its attack on our base 4000 clicks away."

4152, "Yes, sir, the Aggressive has taken the bait."

4153, "Guard the Ganymede, pilots. If that ship goes down, so do you!"

4154, "The SD Sauron has jumped in. Kortan, help destroy it!"

4155, "We have a problem. The Sauron has brought fighter escort, a wing of Manticores. They're targetting the Ganymede. Protect it, pilots."

4156, "The Kortan has been destroyed! Return to base at once!"

4157, "Good work, pilots, there are no more Shivans left in this system. Return to base."

4158, "AWACS is down! Our cover is blown! Prepare for Shivan reinforcements!"

4159, "It's a Lucifer class superdestroyer! Get out of there now, pilot!"

4160, "Reports coming in that the SD Sauron is headed our way!"

4161, "Third Coming"

4162, "2 years after the second Shivan invasion, a anomalous reading is found in the Ross 128 system.  Alpha wing is sent to investigate
"

4163, "This is Admiral Petrach, Commanding officer of the GTD Aquitaine.  To all the new pilots arriving onboard the Aquitaine, welcome.

The Aquitaine was the first of the Hecate destroyers, brought into service shortly before the Second Great War.  The Aquitaine bore the brunt of the fighting against the Shivans in the Gamma Draconis and Capella systems.  We're part of history here, pilot."

4164, "Two years have passed since the collapsing of the Jump nodes leading to Capella.  Two years without sight nor sound of the Shivans.  If we have learned anything from our past experiences, it is that we cannot take for granted the recent peace we have enjoyed.  At any time, we could be thrust back into the chaos of war."

4165, "As you probably already know, the scientists who discovered the Knossos portal which caused the Shivan incursion into our space for the second time have begun work on a portal between Delta Serpentis and Sol.  The Aquitaine's objective is to oversee construction and neutralize any threat."

4166, "The biggest source of danger comes from the newly resurrected Hammer of Light.  If you have studied the history of the GTVA, you will know that the Hammer of Light is a Vasudan splinter group, commited to acts of terrorism against the GTVA.

HOL forces have been seen in several key locations in Delta Serpentis, therefore we will have to be on the lookout.

Several errant transmissions have been detected in systems throughtout GTVA space, thus we believe the HOL is amassing for a strike against us."

4167, "At 1730 hrs yesterday, several strange readings were recorded by a science vessel on the edge of the Ross 128 system.  The readings were not wholly conclusive, but indicate some kind of activity in the system.

Command thinks that this could be an HOL staging area, so we are sending the Aquiatine to deal with the renegades."

4168, "The Aquitaine will arrive in system within the hour.   Alpha Wing will recon the area and, if necessary, eliminate hostile vessels.  We will not commit the Aquitaine unless it is absolutely imperative."

4169, "Your squadron and the Aquitaine were victorious.  Your victory has boosted the morale of servicemen and women throughout Terran-Vasudan space.  You and your squad are to be commended."

4170, "Your incompetence has left the lives of millions in jeopardy, pilot.  You are stripped of all rank and privileges until further notice.  You will be transferred to the freighter depot at Antares, where you can spend your remaining days piloting a Triton."

4171, "The cowardly way in which you left the battlefield has left the entire future of Terran-Vasudan space in jeopardy."

4172, "Unfortunately, the fate of our civilizations now hangs in the balance.  Scientists have detected dozens of these devices within the Ross 128 system, along with more within Ikeya and Laramis.  The Third Shivan invasion is apparently upon us, a war which we have little chance of winning.  The Hammer of Light pales in significance when compared with this new threat. "

4178, "Sensors are reading a massive power spike from the devices, looks like we're about to have company."

4179, "Sensors reading a massive configuration! It's a Shivan Ravana destroyer, Command, get some fire support out here now!"

4180, "We are deploying the Aquitaine, please stand by."

4181, "This is the GTD Aquitaine, Alpha wing, engage emeny fighters, we'll take care of the devices and the Ravager."

4182, "Beam turrets, open fire!"

4183, "All devices destroyed, concentrate all fire on that destroyer."

4184, "The Ravager is going down, stand clear of the blast!"

4185, "Good job Alpha, now take down the turrets on that destroyer."

4186, "Aquitaine heading home, Alpha Wing, return to base."

4187, "Aquarius wing is trying to disarm our beam turrets, stop them, Alpha wing!"

4188, "A pair of Rakshasas have emerged from the portal, designation Baramas."

4189, "Baramas objective neutralized."

4190, "The Ravager has launched a wing of Taurvis, take them out before they can fire their bombs at the Aquitaine."

4191, "Alpha wing, we cannot allow more ships to enter, destroy those devices now!"

4192, "Those cruisers will tear the Aquitaine to pieces."

4193, "Launching Delta wing now."

4194, "Third Watch"

4195, "Only the 119th can stop a massive pirate attack from wiping out Knossos Point."

4196, "The Story So Far

The year is 2374. Seven years have passed since the destruction of Capella and the end of the second Great War. Morale is high as the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance completes its most expensive and ambitious project to date: The Knossos Project."

4197, "It appears that no one can challenge the superiority of the GTVA.  Admiral Bosch's Neo Terran Front has been reduced to warring groups of rag-tag pirates.  The Shivans have been stranded in Capella and haven't been heard from since the final days of the Second Great War.  

However, unbeknownst to the Alliance, an ancient foe waits in the shadows for the time to strike back on the victors of a conflict that ended a generation ago."

4198, "You are a pilot on the GTD Ithica. A top pilot of the graduating class of 2373 at the academy, you are assigned to the 119th Blue Devils Squadron.  A child of the lost generation, you prepare to fight for a planet you have only heard of in story books and of beauty that you can only dream of."

4199, "* GTD Ithica - 08-25-2374 - Delta Serpentis *

Welcome Aboard from Admiral Renniger

I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the new pilots assigned to the 132nd Argonauts and the 119th Blue Devils squadrons. I believe you'll find your new ship- and squad-mates to be very helpful and courteous."

4200, "GTD Ithica

The GTD Ithica, a Hecate-class destroyer,  has served the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance for over two years.  Commissioned in 2372, the Ithica is home to four fighter squadrons, two companies of Terran Marines, and ten thousand crew members. The Ithica has played an important role in the GTVA fleet, partcipating in such anti-pirate operations as Operation Skyhook and Operation Overlord. Serve the Ithica well, she's a fine ship.

From here, I will turn this briefing over to your new squadron leaders."

4201, "119th Blue Devils

Welcome to the 119th, pilot.  I'm Lt. Cmdr. Taubach, squadron leader of the Blue Devils.

The Blue Devils are a multi-role squadron.  We are called upon to do a multitude of tasks and Command expects us to do each task to the best of our ability, whether it be a patrol, an escort, or a strike. I trust that you will make a fine addition to our proud squadron."

4202, "Knossos Project

As you know, the Terra Knossos is nearing completion in the Delta Serpentis system.  Dr. Hargrove and her staff are working around the clock to prepare for the activation of the device that is scheduled to occur in two weeks.  

While the GTD Ithica is dispatched to Beta Aquilae to oversee the settling of the Vasudan Laborers Union and the Akheton Corporation's labor dispute, the 119th will be left behind in Delta Serpentis to safeguard the completion of the Terra Knossos. Briefing follows."

4203, "Construction has just been completed on a GTI Arcadia station near $f Knossos $f Point in the Delta Serpentis system."

4204, "The delivery of the station's fighter complement has been delayed, leaving the station undefended.  While the Ithica heads toward the Beta Aquilae system, the 119th and the 43rd squadrons will be assigned to protect the station."

4205, "Station activity has been high in the last few weeks due to the scheduled test of the $f Terra $f Knossos in sixteen days.  Expect a number of transports to be in the area between the station and the Knossos."

4206, "Command fears that increased pirate activity in the Ross 128 system may carry over to the Delta Serpentis system.  Any attack on the station is very likely to come from the nearby jump node to Ross 128."

4207, "You may notice Dr. Hargrove and her staff working at the Terra Knossos portal.  You are not to interfere with her work and are to keep a distance of ten thousand meters from the Von Braun at all times. "

4208, "Fifteen minutes after you launch, the GTD Calypso will relieve your patrol and deliver the Station's fighter complement.

"

4209, "Do not underestimate the importance of this mission, pilot.  Seven years of work and trillions of credits have been poured into the Knossos Project.  It all comes down to this patrol on whether or not we succeed in returning to our home planet.  Good luck, pilot.  Dismissed.

"

4210, "Thanks to your efforts, Knossos station survived the pirate attack and the project is still on schedule for its testing sequence.  Commander Ordover, magistrate of the station, commends you for your fine work."

4211, "The loss of the station will clear a path to future attacks on the Terra Knossos and ultimatly delay our return home.  This kind of performance is not acceptable, pilot.  You have been confined to quarters until a proper hearing can take place."

4212, "The desertion of your post opened up Knossos Station for a massive pirate attack.  The station didn't stand a chance.  Not only did we lose the station, but the pirates managed to land a number of heavy torpedo hits on the Von Braun, killing Dr. Hargrove and many members of her staff.  You have been confined to quarters pending a court martial hearing.  "

4213, "GTVA officials have tracked the actual science cruiser that was to be used by Dr. Nelson and her staff to the Ross 128 system.  Approximately twelve hours before the arrival of GTVA investigation forces, the Faustus carrying her was destroyed by pirate insurgents.  It is not believed her death will delay the completion date of the Terra Knossos and its subsequent tests."

4214, "Our squadron has been reassigned to Knossos Station until the Ithica returns to Delta Serpentis. All pilots will find their temporary room assignments on the squadron message board at 1400 hours.  Dismissed."

4237, "Mendel, Dr. Nelson was not scheduled to arrive for another three days.  Why are you arriving early?"

4238, "We have new information from the GTVA Laboratories in Altair.  It is extremely urgent that we deliver this information now."

4239, "Stand by Mendel.  We are authorizing your arrival with GTVA command."

4256, "Concentrate on keeping the Shivan fighters away from the bombers in Beta wing. Be sure to maneuver your fighter so that your target remains centered on your HUD. When you achieve lock, fire your missiles."

4257, "Great work, pilot. You're an asset to this unit and to the Alliance. 

We have yet to determine the full extent of the Shivan presence, but if every operation proceeds as smoothly as this one, we will have the nebula under allied control in no time.
