MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "I've just got off comms with Admiral Bertini. He's pleased with the Guardador op but wants to maintain 'strategic momentum', in his words." 7297 "25a-05"
MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "He's building up a force to assault Vicare Station. Says he needs the shipyards to maintain his fleet strength." 7298 "25a-06"

MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "Maybe. I'm not sure if Kakotchka would commit to a serious defense if there's a risk of high losses. Vicare Station's useful but not crucial. He may have a chance." 7300 "25a-08"

SHOWICON cleghorn file="portrait_cleghorn" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "I'm considering sending a small detachment to support the attack. If Bertini takes Vicare, he'll be less dependent on our support for the rest of the Malikan war. It's a decent enough investment." 7304 "25a-12"

SHOWICON tierney file="portrait_tierney" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "That'll be the best outcome. The Sulsians resent us being here, but expect us to follow them lockstep in all things." 7305 "25a-13"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "I know we're allies and the future of Sulsia hinges on this, but really? If you want my opinion, the galaxy'll be better off without the Hegemony." 7306 "25a-14"

MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "The Sulsians can be occasionally useful. Bertini plans to attack once his forces are ready, maybe a week or so. I need your input. What can we deploy in that time?" 7307 "25a-15"

MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Hmm...we'll have to reprioritise our resupply schedule, release some of the light escort units. Have the Ladigue workers run double shifts. Might work." 7308 "25a-16"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "We could have a force mission-ready within a week. I'll have my staff run some estimates and get back to you later." 7309 "25a-17"

MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "Thank you Deckard, that would be splendid. We only need to send a few light units with a cruiser anchor. I'll also ask Admiral Aguillard to contribute some Republique ships." 7310 "25a-18"

MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "The LC is doing well enough at Aria for now. He's a competent enough pilot, but it sounds like he's been stung by ANI before. I'm keeping his clearance as-is." 7313 "25a-21"

SHOWICON cleghorn file="portrait_cleghorn" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "Agreed. In any event he's most useful at Aria under Cameron's observation. I want him close at hand and accessible at all times. He's going to be of more use with ANI than with Fleet Air." 7314 "25a-22"
MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "And Deckard? Keep trying to pin down the location of those high value targets we discussed. I plan to meet Kakotchka with every advantage we can muster." 7315 "25a-23"
