+Tech Description: XSTR("The Avenger is the baseline weapon of all Terran and Vasudan fighters, now that the outdated ML-16 has been fully replaced. The Avenger utilizes a sheath of ultra-heated and unstable plasma wrapped around a core 45mm projectile to provide a combination of physical and energy-based damage to enemy targets. The broad spectrum of frequencies within the plasma coating the projectile allows for relatively effective penetration of shields, at the cost of partial melting of the projectiles, impinging on hull damage. While an effective baseline weapon, currently Subach-Innes is working on a prototype xaser capable of matching the avenger in performance, though such a design would be very costly.", 932)

The HL-7's development by Subach-Innes has been criticized for its increase in cost and near-equal capabilities when compared to the Avenger, the current standard Terran and Vasudan weapon. Nonetheless, the HL-7 does have some merits: it has a higher rate of fire than the Avenger and Prometheus both, while drawing roughly the same amount of energy. The winding down of Avenger production and the ever decreasing stocks of argon for the Prometheus have slowly been pushing the HL-7 towards future standardization.", 972)

+Tech Anim: cb_howell
+Tech Description: XSTR("During the Great War, the Shivan destroyers were, by all accounts, vastly superior to both the Terrans' and the Vasudans', able to annhilate either in minutes. In an attempt to turn the tide, the GTI Research and Development branch rushed to deploy their untested prototype torpedoes. However, after the unanticipated destruction of the Lucifer, GTI R&D issued an immediate recall, using the known flaws as a guise to pour vast amounts of fundings towards developing the Hades superdesroyer. Largely forgotten, the prototypes were only accidentally rediscovered when investigators were searching through the GTI records. 

After its re-introduction, the only working torpedo was renamed the GTM-205 Howell Torpedo. As the latest in destroyer technology, it signals the re-rise of the destroyer class. No bomber commissioned by the GTA has the capacity to carry even one of these. The Howell is slightly weaker than the Tsunami because it sacrifices explosive yield for increased range. However, it also has a substantially higher refire rate than any bomber torpedo. Coated with the experimental partially-collapsed-core molybdenum, the Howell is the fastest and most durable bomb ever produced, making interception difficult.

Despite these advantages, the Howell torpedo is criticized for being too costly. Others question the GTA's reason for not disclosing the how they corrected the imperfections, such as the occasional lockups and early detonation that may occur within a destroyer. To them, the move is irresponsible. They request that the GTA be more transparent and to hire an independent research team in order to have the test be unbiased. Only time will tell if the torpedoes will continue to be produced in the future.", 1089)

+Tech Anim: cb_aratrum
+Tech Description: XSTR("The PVM-300 Aratrum is the first torpedo designed by Vasudans as a true anti-capital ship weapon. During the 14-Year War, the Vasudans believed that they would win the war when they witnessed the Typhon's first successful deployment. The Parliament quickly announced that a 'Destroyer Killer' would be added to the Typhon's already deadly arsenal. But soon after the declaration, the Aratrum project experienced large-scale corruption. Most of the funds allocated to R&D went into churning out more immediate-yet-disposable war machines such as fighters and transports. It was because of this that the Aratrum was only installed after the Howell was recommissioned.

The strengths and weaknesses of the Aratrum remain classified, so no comparisons between the Howell and the Aratrum torpedoes have yet been made. Contradicting statements by the PVN and the PVE cause further challenges in determining the role of the weapon. Whereas PVN admirals boast the superiority of the weapon over the GTA's, the PVN officials downplay it as a defensive weapon. What we have been told is that the Aratrum carries multi-yield warheads, and its official test-flight revealed that it is capable of aspect lock. The Aratrum seems to be limited to being equipped by capital ships only, but this remains to be seen.", 1092)

+Tech Title: XSTR("PVM-300 Aratrum Torpedo", 1091)
+Tech Anim: cb_aratrum
+Tech Description: XSTR("The PVM-300 Aratrum is the first torpedo designed by Vasudans as a true anti-capital ship weapon. During the 14-Year War, the Vasudans believed that they would win the war when they witnessed the Typhon's first successful deployment. The Parliament quickly announced that a 'Destroyer Killer' would be added to the Typhon's already deadly arsenal. But soon after the declaration, the Aratrum project experienced large-scale corruption. Most of the funds allocated to R&D went into churning out more immediate-yet-disposable war machines such as fighters and transports. It was because of this that the Aratrum was only installed after the Howell was recommissioned.

The strengths and weaknesses of the Aratrum remain classified, so no comparisons between the Howell and the Aratrum torpedoes have yet been made. Contradicting statements by the PVN and the PVE cause further challenges in determining the role of the weapon. Whereas PVN admirals boast the superiority of the weapon over the GTA's, the PVN officials downplay it as a defensive weapon. What we have been told is that the Aratrum carries multi-yield warheads, and its official test-flight revealed that it is capable of aspect lock. The Aratrum seems to be limited to being equipped by capital ships only, but this remains to be seen.", 1092)

+Tech Description: XSTR("An electronic countermeasure (ECM) is a device designed to trick or deceive radar, sonar or other detection systems.. It may be used both offensively and defensively to deny targeting information to an enemy. The system may make many separate targets appear to the enemy, or make the real target appear to disappear or move about randomly. Most forces use ECM to protect their craft from attack during stealth or surprise operations. It is frequently coupled with stealth advances so that the ECM systems have an easier job. Offensive ECM often takes the form of jamming while defensive ECM usually comes in the form of blip enhancement or distortion.", 1119)
