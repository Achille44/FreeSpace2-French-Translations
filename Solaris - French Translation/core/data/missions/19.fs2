    XSTR("Katherine Lau, please forward this message as you see appropriate.

We can confirm all Renewal convoy ships are accounted for, with no casualties reported. The Crown is grateful for your assistance, and payment has been forwarded as per contract.

Unfortunately the efforts of Navo's marines to apprehend the crew were unsuccessful. The freighter crew were clearly on a suicide mission and had contingencies in place in the event of capture. There was not enough left of their bodies for a clear identity verification. We have recovered the remains for DNA matching.

I have compiled a report to Crown High Command regarding the events of today. I plan to especially highlight the contributions of Lieutenant Stuart Ross who was crucial to the neutralisation of the nuclear attack. May he continue to serve Sulsia with the same dedication as he serves His Majesty.", 4713)
