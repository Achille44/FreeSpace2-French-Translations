1, "Deep in the Ross 128 system, the GTA Installation Riviera picks up a
distress call from a Terran pilot.  A disbelieving communications
officer listens as the pilot frantically requests cover from
phantom attackers."

2, "Ancients 1"

3, "The Ancients discover subspace and begin their empire."

4, "Lab Experiment"

5, "A joint Terran-Vasudan science team conducts experiments
utilizing captured Shivan technology."

6, "Command Briefing"

7, "GTA Intelligence briefs pilots on a daring and important plan
to counter Shivan advancement."

8, "Ancients 2"

9, "Strange and powerful forces attack the Ancients."

10, "Hall Fight"

11, "A GTA boarding party attempts to neutralize forces in a captured Shivan
freighter."

12, "Ancients 3"

13, "The Ancients begin their final struggle."

14, "Ancients 4"

15, "The Ancients understand their destruction."

16, "Ancients 5"

17, "The Ancients discover a weakness in their dark enemies, but not in time
to save themselves."

18, "End Game"

19, "The Shivan superdestroyer almost makes it to the Sol system, but the Terran-Vasudan
forces emerge victorious."

20, "The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA.  Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for three years.  There is no more important symbol of Terran pride than a ship like the Galatea or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety.  In the course of the fourteen-year war, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat."

236, "We require target data."

237, "Targeting data was not received."

238, "Cease firing on friendly craft!"

239, "Pilot, cease firing!"

240, "Aim at the hostiles, pilot!"

241, "That's a friendly ship, pilot."

242, "Cease firing on that ship, Terran!"

243, "Disregard that target!"

244, "You are firing on friendly targets, pilot."

245, "Cease firing!  That is not a hostile target!"

246, "Ship down!  Ship down!"

247, "Alpha 1, please respond!"

269, "Sir, I need a repair ship."

270, "This crate's about to blow.  Calling in for repair!"

271, "Subsystems compromised.  Requesting repair."

272, "You're straying too far from mission objectives!"

273, "Where are you going, pilot?"

274, "Where are you going, Terran?"

275, "You appear to be off course, pilot."

276, "You'll pay for that, traitor!"

277, "You will pay for your treason, pilot!"

278, "You have tested our patience long enough, Terran!"

279, "Your treason will not go unpunished!"

280, "All Terran pilots, shoot to kill Alpha 1."

281, "All units, destroy the renegade pilot!"

282, "Affirmative, sir."

283, "I'm on it."

284, "Roger that, sir."

285, "Yes sir."

286, "Yes sir!"

287, "As you wish."

288, "Affirmative."

289, "Roger, sir.  On our way."

290, "Acknowledged.  Stand by to rearm."

291, "We're already on our way, sir."

292, "Support request confirmed.  Please stand by."

293, "Support ship being deployed."

294, "Support request acknowledged."

295, "Rearming complete, sir."

296, "Rearming procedure complete."

297, "Rearming sequence aborted."

298, "Rearming procedure terminated."

299, "Support has been destroyed."

300, "Alpha 1, you're all alone.  No reinforcements available."

301, "We cannot deploy any additional fighters, pilot.  You are on your own."

302, "Have you lost your mind?  Training is terminated, return to base."

303, "Pilot, do not fire upon your instructor!"

304, "You are ordered to return at once, pilot."

305, "Pilot, you are straying too far from the engagement zone."

306, "Pilot, you are being removed from battle because of your insubordination."

307, "Pilot, this is your final warning.  Return to your assigned coordinates."

308, "Weapons array diminished.  Calling in for support."

309, "Ensign"

310, "Dang, you're still an Ensign!  You must have gotten busted!"

311, "Lieutenant Junior Grade"

312, "Congratulations.  Your achievements have been noted and you are duly awarded the rank Lieutenant Junior Grade."

313, "Lieutenant"

314, "Per GTAR 64-2a you are hereby promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.  Congratulations."

315, "Lieutenant Commander"

316, "Congratulations.  Your achievements have been noted and you are duly awarded the rank of Lieutenant Commander."

317, "Commander"

318, "Because of your consistent sense of duty and obvious skill as a leader, you have been promoted to the rank of Commander."

319, "Captain"

320, "For displaying a commanding nature and the ability to lead others you are hereby promoted to Captain.  Congratulations!"

321, "Commodore"

322, "For outstanding service through the war, leading many successful missions, and promoting a sense of honor and pride in the Alliance you have been promoted to the rank of Commodore."

323, "Rear Admiral"

324, "We aren't sure how you've done it, but you are hereby promoted to the prestigious rank of Rear Admiral.  (We think you cheated.)"

325, "Vice Admiral"

326, "You really must have cheated to get this rank!  Do you want to sit behind a desk or something?  That is what Vice Admirals do."

327, "Admiral"

328, "You really have got to stop cheating.  This could become a natural thing for you... and that would be bad.  Go on Admiral Cheater, I think you have to perform some ceremony or inspection or something."

329, "Advanced Space Superiority"

330, "Excellent"

331, "Light"

332, "Triton Dynamics"

333, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other GTA fighters."

334, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the GTF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed."

335, "Space Superiority"

336, "Fair"

337, "Medium"

338, "Han-Ronald Corporation"

339, "Original space superiority fighter of the GTA fleet.  Highly versatile, it often doubles as an assault fighter.  Low weapon compatibility."

340, "The Apollo is the most common GTA fighter.  It is highly versatile and can perform multiple roles, including space superiority, interception and assault."

341, "Interceptor"

342, "Good"

343, "High speed recon and bomber-intercept fighter.  Offers high weapon compatibility and payload."

344, "Using the old GTF Angel scout fighter as a template, the GTA created the Valkyrie interceptor fighter.  It has two additional engines, as well as an additional set of primary hardpoints.  This makes the Valkyrie the best bomber interceptor in the fleet.  Its speed is unmatched in the GTA, and its maneuverability is above average.  Its only drawbacks are a small secondary payload and a weak hull."

345, "Heavy Assault"

346, "Average"

347, "Low max velocity offset by its tremendous offensive capabilities.  High weapon capacity."

348, "The Hercules is the slowest and most unmanageable fighter in the fleet.  This is offset, however, by its overpowering weaponry and shielding.  It carries six primary weapons, as well as two full secondary banks.  This heavy assault fighter is best suited for small target attacks and bomber escort."

349, "Recon"

350, "High"

351, "Low"

352, "High max velocity offset by its tiny payload.  High weapon compatibility."

353, "Designed by GTI engineers, the Loki is undoubtedly the best reconnaissance craft in Terran or Vasudan service.  Its hull shape and shielded reactor chamber lends itself to providing a low sensor profile, yet it is capable of very high speed maneuvers.  Its relatively light armament and low armor rating make it unsuitable for extended firefights, however."

354, "Low offensive capability.  Best used in swarm situations."

355, "The old Angel scout fighter is second only to the Apollo in length of service and number of kills.  Developed as an interceptor/reconnaissance fighter in the first years of the Terran-Vasudan War, it also made a formidable match for the PVF Anubis and other early Vasudan fighters.  Upgrades to the Apollo have made the Angel largely obsolete, and the original design has since been retired in favor of its successor, the GTF Valkyrie."

356, "Light Bomber"

357, "Dynamic Metamer"

358, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Good speed for its size, with a high capacity afterburner reserve."

359, "The smallest bomber in the fleet, the Athena has oftentimes been mistaken for a fighter.  However, one should not be fooled by its small size.  The Athena can carry light bombs and most missiles.  It also has the ability to dogfight well.  Its strong shielding and hull make it the favored ''Lightning Bomber'' of the GTA."

360, "Strike Bomber"

361, "Poor"

362, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Can carry Tsunamis.  Good afterburner supply."

363, "Another product of GTI R&D, the Zeus strike bomber is a worthy successor to the Athena.  Its balanced design and increased reactor capacity give it remarkable speed for a bomber, yet it still remains capable of carrying the powerful Tsunami bombs.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against capital ships."

364, "Heavy Bomber"

365, "Heavy"

366, "Suitable for any size target.  Carries most missile types, but few cannons.  Armed with defensive turret, but still requires escort."

367, "The Medusa is the standard attack bomber in the GTA.  Its strong shielding and large secondary capacity make it the favored attack craft against cruiser class targets.  As the first bomber to carry the Tsunami bomb, the Medusa is considered the staple of any bomber pilot's career."

368, "Assault Bomber"

369, "Very Poor"

370, "Designed to annihilate capital ships and cruisers.  Slow, but offers unparalleled assault bombing capability."

371, "The Ursa is the first bomber designed specifically for the purpose of annihilating capital ships.  It carries a massive payload and is the only bomber in the GTA which can equip the Harbinger bomb.  Strong shielding and hull make the Ursa very difficult to destroy."

372, "The Amazon is a simple drone, used for basic combat training.  They are unmanned, and carry only the weakest of weaponry."

373, "The Advanced Amazon is a larger drone, used by the GTA for subsystem and large target training.  They are unmanned and inexpensive."

374, "The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible.  It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

375, "Since the start of space colonization, this standard transport has been used by everyone, both civilian and military.  While it has undergone minor changes time and again, it remains a simple design: a vehicle meant to transport personnel from one place to another."

376, "Tactical Transport"

377, "Very Heavy"

378, "Kallisti Corporation"

379, "Designed for tactical delivery of troops to enemy positions.  Low maneuverability offset by high armor rating and max velocity."

380, "The GTT Hunter was designed by GTI for surgical strike purposes requiring small squads of highly-trained marines.  Faster, smaller, and more heavily armed than the Elysium, it is capable of performing limited offensive roles in addition to carrying soldiers and cargo.  The GTI primarily uses these ships to deposit small teams of special forces units to soften up the enemy in preparation for larger assaults by conventional boarding parties."

381, "The Poseidon is the standard military freighter in the GTA.  It is designed to protect its cargo from any kind of attack, and has four turrets with which to do so."

382, "The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTA for deep space cargo transport.  It has all the electronics and systems needed to preserve any cargo within it at whatever conditions are necessary.  TC 2s are cheap to manufacture and are heavily used throughout the Alliance."

383, "The TSC 2 was developed when Terran Command decided it needed a stronger and more secure cargo container for use in military operations.  It improves on the established TC 2 design by sacrificing a small amount of internal space for a significantly stronger hull.  Although it is still not as strong as the TAC 1, the TSC 2 is usually the GTA's container of choice for cargo with military value."

384, "The TTC 1 is another example of civilian equipment used by the GTA League of Defense.  It is primarily a tech container used for research purposes, especially zero-G development operations.  It is not very strong, however, and is often a target of enemy attacks."

385, "The Chronos is a freighter of civilian design.  As the Terran-Vasudan war dragged on, more and more of these vessels were commissioned by the GTA for use in military operations.  These vessels are slow but strong."

386, "The TAC 1 (called the TacOne by most pilots) is a heavily armored container, usually used for carrying volatile or dangerous substances.  It is also the preferred supply container for use in front-line operations."

387, "The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the T-V war wouldn't be over in a few months."

388, "After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, Command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds."

389, "The Faustus science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft.  However, in the fourteen years since the Terran-Vasudan war began, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research.  Its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships, hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle."

390, "The standard Terran Probe is an all-purpose instrument that can be used in a variety of situations.  They are found in missions ranging from unmanned exploration of new systems, to scientific observation of interesting areas of space, to surveying of patrol routes or suspected enemy positions.  In a pinch, they can be deployed as communications buoys or as couriers for important messages or scientific data.  Their great speed and small size make them useful in battle situations where the enemy will most probably give them a low target priority."

391, "The GTD Hades is a new class of Terran destroyer constructed under the authority of the GTI.  Not much is known of its design or purpose, but it appears to be an attempt to recreate the SD Lucifer.  All available data on the Hades has been highly classified by Terran Command.

The Hades should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

392, "Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia-class station was commissioned, GTA decided to reclassify it as an installation rather than a space station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia-class installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability."

393, "The GTI Polaris is the GTA's standard drydock facility.  A network of Polaris modules allows construction and maintenance of nearly any Terran ship in service.  The drydock's modular design allows inexpensive replacement of damaged sections should one of these facilities come under attack."

394, "Asteroid bases such as these are used by both civilian and military contractors to mine resources and conduct experiments."

395, "The Terran NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Terran convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

396, "The Watchdog is the standard unmanned defensive sentry turret for the GTA.  It fires two standard plasma bursts at any nearby hostile targets."

397, "The Cerberus is an advanced version of the Watchdog, with stronger weaponry and the ability to withstand more damage."

398, "The Hermes escape pod has been used since the destruction of the GTD Goliath over twelve years ago.  They are used by the crews of destroyers and installations to escape destruction.  It is always best to be prepared."

399, "Mekhu/Triton"

400, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other PVN fighters."

401, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the PVF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.

The PVF Ulysses is nearly identical to the GTF Ulysses, except that the Vasudan variant can accommodate Vasudan pilots in its cockpit."

402, "Light Skirmish"

403, "Mekhu Enterprises"

404, "Lowest power Vasudan craft.  Offers little in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.  Best used in swarm situations."

405, "The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

406, "Heavy Fighter"

407, "Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

408, "As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

409, "Very Good"

410, "Akheton Corporation"

411, "Extremely fast with good weapons compatibility.  Very useful in any kind of engagement."

412, "The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA.  This makes it extremely dangerous.  Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy.  This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.

As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible."

413, "Sahr Corporation"

414, "Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

415, "The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses-class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

416, "Bomber"

417, "Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However, carries good payload including space bombs.  Most commonly used in cruiser strikes."

418, "The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations.  It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor.  It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity, and is faster and more maneuverable.

The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris cruisers and a D class threat otherwise."

419, "Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

420, "The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion-class destroyers in the past two years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

421, "Hammer of Light"

422, "Vasudan-Shivan hybrid.  Fast and powerful."

423, "The PVB Sekhmet is a Hammer of Light ship that appears to be a fusion of Vasudan and Shivan technology.  The Hammer of Light claims that its design was adapted from a new class of Shivan bomber heretofore unencountered by either the GTA or the PVN.

Sporting four primary weapon hardpoints and three missile bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch.  Treat it as a class A threat to all allied capital ships."

424, "The Jackal is a simple training and reconnaissance drone used by the PVN.  As the Jackal could be mass-produced quickly and cheaply, it was not long before the Vasudans used it as a template for the PVF Anubis, a piloted variant well suited for use as a swarm fighter.

The Jackal has never been used offensively against the GTA and is classified as a non-threat."

425, "The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

426, "The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size.  Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally this class has been known to act as a repair ship or tugboat.  It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position."

427, "The Bast freighter is unarmed, and considered a non-threat.  We believe that it is mainly used by Vasudan civilians, but we have seen some in front line operations.  It has very low target value, but should be destroyed, as any kind of resupply ship is a danger to the GTA."

428, "The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

429, "With three turrets, the Ma'at is a hairy target for GTA pilots to attack.  However, it is slow enough that it can be destroyed with enough patience.  As always, supply ships for the PVN are considered to be valid targets."

430, "The VAC 4 series of cargo containers is much like its normal counterpart, except it has much more plating.  However, this container is no more dangerous than the standard version, and is nothing more than ML-16 bait without protection of some kind."

431, "The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter.  It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot.  However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a class C threat.  Treat it as one."

432, "The Aten-class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans' warships, falls short as a attack cruiser.  It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry.  With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.  Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

The Aten-class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a class B threat."

433, "The PVSC Imhotep is the standard Vasudan research vessel.  Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys.  One major difference between the two classes is that the Imhotep carries a small podbay housing four remote research pods.  These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems."

434, "This large probe is more of a fully-fledged research pod than a simple drone.  Designed to work in collaboration with an Imhotep science cruiser or as part of team of probes, it is capable of numerous roles including observation, experimentation, and scientific analysis.  It is often possible for a wing of probes to conduct minor missions independent of outside supervision, allowing Vasudan Command to reserve their Imhoteps for deployment where the personal presence of scientists is most needed."

435, "Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations.  The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology.  When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.

The Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup."

436, "The gargantuan Karnak installation is the Vasudans' answer to the GTI Arcadia.  This monstrous facility bristles with dozens of turrets and can house up to two full squadrons of fighters.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a construction and maintenance yard for the Vasudan fleets.

Because of its enormous logistical and strategic value, the Karnak is considered a class A threat."

437, "The PVI Shah is nearly identical to our GTI Polaris, despite the fact that they were designed separately.  Like the Polaris, the Shah serves as a construction and maintenance facility."

438, "The Vasudan NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Vasudan convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

439, "The Ankh is the standard Vasudan sentry gun.  Its most common usage is guarding supply depots.  However, since the development of the Anubis, its usage has dropped off significantly."

440, "The Ra has been used by Vasudans since our first encounter with them.  Every Vasudan capital ship has a few of these lifeboats."

441, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity.

The GTA considers the Dragon as a class A threat."

442, "Captured Shivan fighter, modified for Terran pilots."

443, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity."

444, "The Basilisk seems to be a Shivan heavy attack fighter.  It is not as maneuverable as other Shivan fighters, but it packs quite a punch, and it is very resistant to our weaponry.  Most often they have been used in attacking our supply convoys and transports.

Treat the Basilisk as a class C threat."

445, "We believe that the Manticore is a Shivan interceptor.  It has a very high top speed, and its maneuverability is quite good.  However, its shield system isn't strong enough to withstand constant fighting for long, which leads us to believe the Manticore's primary purpose is to destroy enemy bombers.

The Manticore ranks as a class B threat."

446, "We originally thought the Scorpion was the Shivans' best fighter.  However, we now believe that the Scorpion is nothing more than a Shivan scout ship.  Their vast numbers and seeming unimportance to the Shivan war effort leads us to this belief.  Regardless of its purpose, the Scorpion is highly maneuverable, fast, and difficult to destroy.  It can also do damage equivalent to our space superiority fighters.

In the event that you encounter Scorpions, regard them as a class C threat."

447, "The first encounter with the SF Gorgon was made by the GTD Saratoga in the Ikeya system.  We are uncertain if this is a new Shivan design or if the Shivans have simply held this particular class of ship back for the majority of the war.  The ship's unusual design not only provides it with exceptional maneuverability, but also allows it to generate an extremely powerful shield.  So far these ships have only been sighted leading wings of lesser fighters, but there have been reports of entire wings of Gorgons in larger forces.

Little else is known about the Gorgon.  It should be considered a class B threat when acting as a wing leader, but a full wing of Gorgons is to be treated as a class A threat to all allied vessels."

448, "The Shaitan bomber is only slightly superior to our own bombers - its shielding is better, but its capacity seems to be far worse.  Perhaps the Shivans were confident that they would only need one payload to destroy a target.

We consider the Shaitan to be a class C threat."

449, "The Nephilim-class bomber is the most alien of the Shivan ships.  We are still unsure as to why the Shivans chose this odd shape for arguably their most powerful attack craft.  However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to wings of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.

The Nephilim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

450, "The new Seraphim class bomber is the Shivan's latest threat.  It is three times larger than a Nephilim, and carries a massive payload at least 150% the size of the Nephilim.  With strong hulls and an almost impenetrable shield system, the Seraphim is easily the most dangerous bomber we have yet encountered.

The Seraphim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

451, "The SB Nahema has never actually been encountered by either GTA or PVN forces, as far as we can determine.  What little intelligence we have on this bomber comes from our interrogations of HOL prisoners and is strictly classified by GTI.  We do know that the Nahema was the base from which the HOL constructed the PVB Sekhmet, their Vasudan-Shivan hybrid prototype bomber.  How the HOL managed to acquire scans of the Nahema in the first place is unknown."

452, "The Azrael is most likely a Shivan transport.  While we are not completely sure of its uses, we do know that it can house many Shivans.  It is not very heavily armored, and its weaponry is not too strong.  This makes the Azrael the most common target for capture attempts."

453, "The Mephisto freighter behaves much like one of our own, but it is far more powerful and dangerous.  Very little data is available on this ship class."

454, "We believe that the Shivans use cargo containers such as these as storage depots.  We have yet to see a Shivan land on a planet.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans plan on keeping all of their materials and resources in deep space."

455, "Almost no data is available on the Asmodeus freighter.  We are aware that it has a strong hull and four turrets.  Any further data on this ship should be immediately delivered to Terran Intelligence."

456, "What we have dubbed the SAC 2 is simply a more heavily armored form of the standard Shivan cargo container.  We believe that this is where the Shivans keep their more precious supplies.  SAC 2s are to be captured or destroyed at every opportunity."

457, "The Cain is by far the most common cruiser in the Shivan fleet.  It is also the weakest.  However, the Cain should not be underestimated.  It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.

The Cain is a class B threat."

458, "While far more rare than its counterpart, the Cain-class cruiser, the Lilith is one of the most ferocious cruisers we have had the misfortune of combating.  It has extremely strong weapon systems, as well as a very thick armor which our cannons can barely penetrate.  One for one, the Lilith can easily destroy any of our cruisers.  It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.

The Lilith should be considered a class A threat to any ships that encounter it."

459, "While the Demon-class destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada.  However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters.  It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.

The Demon is a class A threat in any allied system."

460, "The Lucifer is the greatest threat to the survival of the GTA, the PVN, and both the Terran and Vasudan species.  It wields three massive flux cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation.  The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.

Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.  If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

461, "We believe that the sole purpose of the Trident is to guard Shivan repair and supply depots.  It is not too strong, but in large numbers it can be dangerous."

462, "Terrans"

463, "Terrans originated on the third planet in the Sol system, known alternately as Terra or Earth.  Terrans are relatively physically weak, but are highly intelligent and versatile.  This combination of intelligence and versatility have allowed Terrans to evolve from tribal, nomadic primates (not entirely unlike their progenitors) to a spacefaring race.

Terran civilization developed to the point of relatively stable nation-states.  With space travel, the nation-state evolved into the global-state and the Terran species furthered its growth, both in material ways and in immaterial, philosophical ways.  In time, the global-state led to the intersystem-state, which in turn led to the Galactic Terran Alliance, a galactic-state.

To date, Terrans have successfully colonized twelve worlds outside of the Sol system.  Outposts have been established on fifteen other planets and moons throughout the known galaxy.  If the past is any indicator of future trends, unified expansionism will only continue to benefit the Alliance, both politically and economically."

464, "Vasudans originate on the fourth planet of the Vasuda system, the only planet in that system that is capable of supporting life.  Their home planet, also known as Vasuda Prime, is a relatively hostile world.  Both of the twin continents of Vasuda Prime are almost entirely desert, and most of the above-ground water is, even by Vasudan standards, undrinkable.  In order to adapt to these surroundings, Vasudans developed quite rapidly.

Vasudan society is complex and filled with peril for the outsider ignorant of their culture.  Vasudans have a range of social tests and protocols, such as The Conversation.  A Terran mishandling of The Conversation is presumed to be one of the major causes of the V-T War.  The Vasudan government is parliamentary in nature, but is presided over by the Imperial family and the Ambassadors, who are quasi-royal go-betweens for the Parliament and the Imperium.

Vasudan space exploration has been driven primarily by the need to find planets capable of sustaining their species.  As resources on Vasuda Prime have diminished, the drive to colonize has intensified among Vasudans in recent decades."

465, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

504, "Don't fire upon friendly ships."

505, "GTW ML-16 Laser"

506, "Standard issue
Medium Hull Damage"

507, "Argon laser weapon - uses transparent ceramic technology in order to create an optical system that is extremely durable and stable under battle conditions - provides adequate destructive damage to the hull of enemy ships by vaporizing molecular bonds at the target area and destabilizing molecular bonds across the grain of the hull material.

The GTA issues ML-16 Lasers to every fighter and bomber in service."

508, "PVW VLL-9 Laser"

509, "Neon laser weapon - uses silvered optics to create a coherent package of energy that is extremely reliable under battle conditions - energy package infuses plasma bolt which is fired at a rate of 2 rounds/second - high thermal mass vaporizes most materials upon impact - prolonged application will cause material integrity failure and hull breach.

Standard issue to Vasudan ensigns.  This cheap, mass-produced laser cannon is similar in performance to the ML-16 but is slightly more effective against insulated subsystems."

510, "GTW-41 Disruptor Cannon"

511, "Standard issue
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

512, "A gas-focused krypton laser - when the ship is in flight, the chamber of the GTW-41 rotates at a constant speed - a small amount of NO2 is injected into the container .05 ms prior to the emission of the laser light - the rotation of the NO2 in the chamber focuses the laser pulse to a state that is only very slightly (1%) diffused - after the laser pulse is emitted from the chamber into space, the chamber expels the NO2 into space (thus expelling ionized molecules and moisture) - the process repeats for each subsequent burst of laser energy - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - the Disruptor Cannon is best suited and is used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Disruptor Cannon should be utilized in all capture operations in order to minimize risk of target's destruction."

513, "GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor"

514, "Advanced Version
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

515, "The Advanced Disruptor Cannon is much like the GTW-41 Disruptor.  However, its speed and higher subsystems damage make it much more useful in operations against faster moving targets."

516, "GVW Akheton SDG"

517, "Tactical Weapon
Subsystem Disruption"

518, "A gas-focused krypton laser - fixed position firing chamber with quartz-timed injector - dynamic magnetization of the diffused laser pulse responds to feedback from targeting sensors - enhanced gaseous acceleration technology results in higher projectile velocity - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - best suited and used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun is a Vasudan retrofit of the GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor cannon.  Alongside the Prometheus Retrofit it is being pushed into mass production as part of a new generation of standard-issue weaponry, replacing the ML-16s and Disruptor Cannons used since the war between our species ten years ago.  While optimized for next-generation warships currently in development, older fighters may be unable to keep up with its demanding power requirements."

519, "GTW-15 Avenger Cannon"

520, "Special Issue
Projectile Weapon
Low Shield Damage"

521, "A rapid-fire, computer-controlled radar and gun system - capable of firing at a rate of more than 4500 rounds per minute - used primarily for close-defense situations - uses closed-loop radar technology to locate, identify, and direct a stream of highly destructive 45mm projectiles to the target.

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.  It has also proven very effective against Vasudan fighters.  However, its substandard anti-shield capabilities make it a poor choice for dogfighting Shivans, although far better than the ML-16."

522, "GTW-32 Flail Rifle"

523, "Special Issue
Low Energy Usage
Kinetic Weapon
Moderate Shield Damage"

524, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

525, "GTW-5 Prometheus Cannon"

526, "Prototype
High Energy Usage
High Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

527, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

528, "GTW-5a Prometheus Cannon Adv."

529, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

530, "Designed as a special-issue upgrade to the standard Prometheus, the Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity.  These advances come at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption, but many pilots feel that the tradeoff yields a net benefit.  This weapon's deployment is currently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions."

531, "GTW-5r Prometheus (retrofit) Cannon"

532, "Standard Issue
High Energy Usage
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage"

533, "GTW-5r Prometheus Retrofit"

534, "The GTW-5a Prometheus R is a modified version of the original Prometheus weapon.  With the link to Earth severed, the GTVA had been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of argon (a required element in the Prometheus's power-generation module) to continue to manufacture the standard Prometheus.  GTVA engineers modified the original design to incorporate some of the advanced electromagnetic mechanisms of the Banshee.  The technology has not been perfected, however, and the Prometheus R suffers from a long recharge cycle and high energy requirements."

535, "GTW-7 Banshee"

536, "Special Issue
EM Weapon
Very High Energy Usage
Extreme Shield Damage"

537, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

538, "GTW-65 Railgun"

539, "Prototype
HiVel Weapon
Long Recharge Cycle"

540, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

541, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

542, "Prototype
Depletes shields"

543, "Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon is very effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim."

544, "GTW-43 Leech Cannon"

545, "Tactical Weapon
Drains Energy
Low Damage"

546, "The Leech Cannon depletes the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use it to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.

The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

549, "UD-1 Volz"

550, "Unstable Derivative Mark One - Xaser weapon, firing an intense, highly focused beam of x-ray emissions - modified power conversion unit interfaces directly with Shivan electronics - extremely limited availability during testing phase.

The UD-1 Volz is a weapon prototype retrofitted from Shivan armaments captured by the GTI.  R&D has modified an undisclosed number of fighters to mount the cannon, and preliminary tests have shown it to be effective against shields and hulls of all varieties."

551, "GTM MX-50"

552, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

553, "Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

554, "GTM-3 Fury Missile"

555, "Standard Issue
Maximum Compatibility"

556, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - GTA fighters can carry more Fury missiles than conventional missiles, due to their small size - used for distraction and other tactical measures - very small payload (3 Kt).

Use is recommended in close combat situations and against larger targets where tracking is a non-issue."

557, "PVM-7 Fang Missile"

558, "Standard Issue
Twin Fire
Maximum Compatibility"

559, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - low accuracy offset by high speed and immunity to electronic countermeasures - very small payload (2 Kt).

A Vasudan missile design employing a 'twin fire' technique.  It is a good choice for close combat and freighter attacks, where tracking is a non-issue. The twin-fire design increases the payload per volley and damage potential for hit-and-run attacks.  The GTA is developing its own swarm missile based on the Fang."

560, "GTM-9 Interceptor"

561, "Standard Issue
Fast Target Lock"

562, "All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

563, "GTM-4 Hornet Swarm Missile"

564, "Special Issue
Swarm Type
Slow Target Lock"

565, "Infrared and ultraviolet tracking - designed to fire in small groups of 4 missiles per burst - light medium payload per missile (12 Kt) - semi-intelligent on-board tracking - single-pass kill probability will not exceed 60% on average - designed as an offensive version of the Fury.

As a ''swarm'' based weapon, this missile can take out an unshielded fighter without any difficulty.  Its four missile system almost guarantees one or two hits, and its speed is quite amazing.  Twice as powerful against naked hulls."

566, "GTM Phoenix V"

567, "Special Issue
Anti-Bomber Missile
Slow Target Lock"

568, "All-aspect seeking - same tracking system as the Interceptor - large payload (50 Kt), but slower than the Interceptor - one of the best fire-and-forget missiles ever developed - many fighter pilots within the GTA regard the Phoenix V as the weapon of choice against high value, heavily defended targets.

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

569, "GTM-31 Disruptor Missile"

570, "Advanced Prototype
Tactical Missile
Disrupts Subsystems"

571, "Advanced signal processing - high precision interception capability - small payload (9 Kt), combining both conventional explosives and a localized blast of energy caused by the effect of impact upon the laser-propulsion system of the missile - designed to temporarily disable subsystems on hostile targets.

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

572, "PVM-2 Havoc Missile"

573, "Special Issue
Fragmentation warhead"

574, "Havoc missiles were special issue during the 14-Year War to Vasudan aces.  It holds the title of being the first missile to use the remote detonation technique later used in the Cluster Bomb.  Chips and shards of non-explosive shrapnel surround the explosive core, stripping shields and armor from its target.  Subsystem damage is minimal due to its superficial damage.  With the development of shield technology, the Havoc is now used against unshielded cargo formations and such."

575, "GTM-1 Synaptic Bomb"

576, "Advanced Bomb
Wing Attack Cluster Explosion
Area Effect"

577, "Missile propulsion unit carrying several small intelligent ''bomblets'' - when distance to target is less than 100 m or when time to impact is less than 2 sec., bomblets direct missile to the most vulnerable part of the ship of those parts of the ship facing the missile - bomblets then separate from missile propulsion unit and form a sphere - inertia continues to carry bomblets in the direction of the target - the missile propulsion unit continues to advance toward the target - when the missile hits the target or 1.5 sec.  after the missile should have hit the target, the bomblets explode - the spherical shape of the formation of the bomblets helps to ensure a fairly even level of damage across a sensitive area on the target - the spherical shape also ensures that the target will not be able to effectively maneuver away from the blast, thus ''pinning'' the target to a specific area in space - can also act as dumbfire - medium payload per bomblet (15 Kt) - very small payload for missile (2 Kt).

Nicknamed the ''Earthshaker'' by the bomber pilots who tested this, it is a bomber's best defense against fighters.  The Synaptic Bomb can do a lot of damage to a lot of ships at one time."

578, "GTM-86 Cluster Bomb"

579, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile"

580, "A second-generation Synaptic bomb, this GTI-developed cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against entire wings of enemy ships.

Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a large field of blast field, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

581, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

582, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile
Destroys Subsystems"

583, "Heat seeking - laser tracking similar to the Interceptor - missile is protected by a small shield system, allowing for greater success in payload delivery during busy melee situations and intense firefights - fast, but low in-flight maneuverability compared to other missiles of comparable size - low maneuverability due to the size of the missile's payload (60 Kt) and on-board shield system.

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

584, "GTM-11 EM Pulse"

585, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse weapon
Anti-bomber weapon"

586, "Upon impact, the EM Pulse temporarily disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

587, "PVM-1 Barracuda Torpedo"

588, "Standard Issue

Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Moderate Lock/Reload Time"

589, "The Barracuda torpedo has been in use by the PVN since the outbreak of the Terran-Vasudan War.  These antimatter weapons do much more damage than our Phoenix V missiles, but are smaller than normal space bombs.  The Barracuda is favored by the Vasudans for attacks against cruisers and stationary installations.  Osiris bombers commonly fire these weapons in pairs for knocking out turrets on capital ships.  The Barracuda's targeting system is prone to malfunctions, and a common field modification is to bypass the aspect lock system completely, permitting dumbfire launches."

590, "GTM-3 Tsunami Bomb"

591, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

592, "Intelligent tracking similar to GTA targeting system - prior to launch, communicates with ship computer, gathering data about enemy target types and whereabouts - slow, low maneuverability - antimatter warhead (500 tonne mass-to-energy conversion) - due to instability of antimatter, no more than 10 may be carried on board a GTA bomber at any given time, unless pilot is granted a special permit by an appropriate governing body.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

593, "GTM-X1 Serkr Bomb"

594, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Non-Conventional Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

595, "Non-conventional thermonuclear warhead - estimated explosive yield not less than 3125 Mt - massive destructive capability not suited for tactical subsystem destruction - highest damage for its size of any GTA bomb - a single bomber carrying GTM-X1 ordnance has a damage potential two-thirds greater than one carrying GTM-N1 ordnance - single stage liquid fuel rocket booster - smallest turn radius and greatest linear velocity of any GTA bomb - highly efficient design for extended weapon lifetime.

The Serkr is a high-yield warhead developed as part of a top-secret GTI experimental weapons program.  Sacrificing anti-subsystem capability for sheer hull-damaging power, the Serkr delivers a destructive payload 33 percent greater than the more common Tsunami.  Like the Tsunami, the Serkr can be loaded on the Medusa medium bomber for tactical deployment -- and with a top speed of 95 m/s, this bomb stands a good chance of eluding even the fastest interceptor fighters.  GTI pilots have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Serkr against capital ships of all types."

596, "GTM-N1 Harbinger Bomb"

Anti-Capital Ship Bomb
Tactical Fusion Warhead
Extremely Long Lock/Reload Time"

598, "Fusion bomb surrounded by 3 salted fission bombs - propulsion unit is a half-size version of a regulation GTA fighter thruster (Class II) - given the weight of the payloads, the missile is slow despite the power of the thruster - as the Harbinger is exceptionally large, GTA bombers are limited to carrying 6 of these weapons at any given time - the resultant shock wave from this weapon is potentially deadly, due to the size of the payloads (5000 Mt in total) - use near allied installations or allied ship groupings is strongly discouraged by the GTA - most effective when used in preemptive defensive strike against non-military installations.

The Harbinger is our best chance of destroying the Lucifer."

810, "Now I am going to show you how to disarm your target using your wingmen.  Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging box again."

811, "Now, select [2] to send your orders to a wing rather than just a ship, then the [1] key to choose Epsilon wing.  By choosing Epsilon wing, you are sending your orders to that wing only.  Finally press the [3] key to ''Disarm Target''."

812, "Observe that your wingmen have made every effort not to destroy your target.  They will only attempt to disarm, thus making sure your target will no longer be able to attack you with any of its weapons."

813, "The next step will be to disable your target.  By giving this order to your wingmen, they will take out the engines of your target, thus disabling it from moving."

814, "You will once again bring up the messaging window by pressing the communications [$c$] key.  Next, select [2] for ''wing'', and [1] for ''Epsilon''.  Finally, press the [2] key to disable your target."

815, "As you can see, your wingmen are now taking out the engines of Freighter 01.  It won't take them long to knock out the engines of this freighter, but keep in mind that other targets can require many more hits to disable it than this freighter does."

816, "Now it's time to put that freighter out of its misery.  Order your wingmen to destroy the freighter."

817, "Well done pilot!"

818, "Press the communications [$c$] button to bring up the messaging window, followed by the [2] key to select a wing, then the [1] key to select Epsilon wing.  Finally press the [1] key to have them destroy your target."

819, "Well, how does it feel to have ordered your first kill?  Hope you enjoyed it because I want you to do it again."

820, "I want you to order Epsilon wing to destroy Freighter 02.  Have you remembered your previous instruction?  If you need to, you can look on your directives for previous instructions of this same goal."

821, "Nicely done Alpha 1.  I think you've got this down."

822, "OK pilot, now that you've had your fun I want to to order Epsilon wing to depart."

823, "All right pilot, now it's time to learn about countermeasures.  A countermeasure presents a new target for the pursuing missile to go after, thus causing the missile to avoid your ship.  As you will soon see this does not always work."

824, "For this lesson we are bringing in one of our Leviathan class cruisers.  Their gunner will be getting practice hitting a moving target, you.  Don't worry, these are just dummy missiles designed to give you a feel for live fire."

825, "In a few seconds the Neptune will begin to launch missiles at you.  Once the missiles are incoming, you will press the countermeasures [$x$] key to release your countermeasures."

826, "You should also immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum, and fly away from the pusuing missile.  In fact, you should be using your afterburners a great deal of the time."

827, "Then when the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile.  The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

828, "While you are launching your countermeasures, you will also try turning your ship about in sharp movements.  This will further help you to avoid being hit by the missile."

829, "That gives us just enough time to squeeze in one more lesson."

830, "It's time for you to reload your countermeasures.  To do this you will need to call in a support ship."

831, "In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your ship to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you.  Check your  indicator in the lower portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

832, "The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your ship with any secondary weapons and countermeasures."

833, "Finally, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to you ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem on your ship.  However, the support ship is not capable of repairing your main hull."

834, "All right pilot, now for a little more paractice with countermeasures.  The Neptune is going to fire at you again.  Take evasive actions."

835, "All right Pilot, I believe that will be enough for today.  The Neptune needs to continue its training elsewhere and you've had enough for one day.  You've done a good job, considering you're just a rookie.  Return to base."

836, "First, make sure that you still have Freighter 01 targeted."

837, "To do this, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

838, "Don't worry, the missiles being fired at you are not armed and will not harm you at all."

839, "You will use your afterburners to help maintain a high speed.  Additionally, you should try to keep the missile pointer at a 3 or 9 o'clock position."

840, "You will do this by pressing the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key for Rearm."

841, "Check your indicator in the lower central portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

842, "Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to fully reload you."

843, "When you have succesfully evaded a missile, an indicator will come up in the upper portion of your targeting reticle.  This will alert you to the fact that you indeed evaded the missile."

844, "Inability to follow instructions results in immediate failure.  Jump back to base to reschedule training phase one."

849, "In addition to the shield technology, the new Interceptor aspect seeking missiles is now available.  They are more powerful than the MX-50s, but require a lock before they may be fired.  You will learn how to properly use the Interceptor in this mission."

850, "The shield is an important addition to your ship, and the Interceptors are a formidable addition to your arsenal.  You must learn how to use them well."

851, "Congratulations.  You have completed your training."

868, "All right.  First we'll cover use of the aspect seeking Interceptor missiles.  Note that you are fully equipped with Interceptors."

869, "Unlike heat seeking missiles, such as the MX-50, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

870, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth this effort, as its homing ability is much stronger."

871, "Once fired, the aspect seeker will track its target anywhere in space.  Once the heat seeker loses track of its target, it is not likely to reacquire lock."

872, "Freighter 1 is now entering.  Let's see how you do with those Interceptors."

873, "Target the freighter. [Press $H$]"

874, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Diamond.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This indicates your Interceptors are locked and ready to fire."

875, "Now, fire one Interceptor at the freighter."

876, "Note how fast the Interceptor moves.  They also deliver quite a payload."

877, "Note that the Interceptor is nearly useless if fired before lock has been attained.  This is a crucial difference between the Interceptor and the MX-50."

878, "Now, target the Weapons subsystem on the freighter. [Press $S$ until targeted.]"

879, "Good.  Now, wait until you have attained lock on the Weapons subsystem."

880, "Now, fire your Interceptors until the Weapons subsystem has been destroyed."

881, "Well done.  Note your Interceptors will be effective in destroying subsystems on large targets."

882, "Now, unload your Interceptors until you've destroyed Freighter 1."

883, "Excellent job.  Now it's time to destroy some moving targets."

884, "A round of Interceptors can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

885, "Your ship is equipped with the new shielding technology.  It is able to absorb a large amount of incoming weapon energy."

886, "As the shield absorbs damage, it becomes weaker.  However, it automatically regenerates itself over time."

887, "Your shield integrity gauge is located at the lower right of your HUD.  It is flashing now."

888, "Your shield is divided into four quadrants, each able to withstand a certain amount of damage."

889, "When a quadrant of your shield suffers damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

890, "Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken damage."

891, "Note how the gauge changes as your shield takes more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage will pass through to the underlying hull."

892, "Note that your shield automatically recharges over time.  I will accelerate this process to save time."

893, "Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

894, "Now your shield has recharged back to full strength.  Next we'll cover shield management."

895, "There are a number of ways you can manage your shield.  The simplest is the Equalize Quadrants function."

896, "Well done.  Note that your front section has been largely recharged.  This came at the expense of shield energy from the three other quadrants."

897, "I have damaged your front shield quadrant again.  Now use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your front quadrant.  [Press $q$]"

898, "I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero strength."

899, "Now you'll learn how to maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

900, "First, you'll maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]"

901, "Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the others were drained."

902, "Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking a large ship against its turret fire."

903, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

904, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can be very useful."

905, "Well done, Pilot.  Aspect seeking missiles are an important part of your arsenal.  Use them well."

906, "And proper shield management can make all the difference in a crucial battle."

907, "This concludes your training.  Return to base."

908, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed location inside your HUD reticle."

909, "I will now call in fighter drones.  When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock.  Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

910, "Once you have acquired lock, fire an Interceptor to destroy the drone.  Note, these drones will not be using countermeasures."

911, "Well done.  Now let's try something a little more difficult.  Wings of two drones will appear at once.  Destroy them all."

912, "All right.  Now we'll move on to your shield system."

913, "Note that you'll need to be in range of these drones before you can gain aspect lock.  Fly towards them."

921, "At the end of your watch, you will be relieved by $f Delta wing.  Upon $f Delta's arrival, you are to return to base."

922, "Your primary objective will be to protect the $f Orff until the end of your watch.  We expect you to carry out your orders to the letter."

There is no place for you in the GTA.  You are dismissed."

925, "If you kill the Vasudan fighters before they reach the Orff, they will not be able to harm it.  Concentrate on one fighter at a time.  When it's destroyed, move to the next.  After Delta wing arrives, you may return to base."

926, "You did a fine job on your first watch, Pilot.  Your strong sense of duty will serve the Alliance well.

The presence of Vasudans in this system gives us little reason to worry.  The ships that attacked you and the Orff were probably remnants of the Vasudan convoy that we hit last week."

927, "Your performance was excellent.  We have no recommendations for you."

928, "Despite your efforts, Vasudan fighters escaped from the system.

If we allow them to elude us, pilot, we appear weak.  We won't tolerate this sort of embarrassment again."

929, "If you are having trouble killing the Vasudans, try launching missiles.  MX-50s automatically seek out a hostile target if it is within range.  After Delta arrives, you can still help them out by destroying more Vasudans."

930, "We are saddened to learn of Lieutenant Harbison's demise.  He was a brave and skillful pilot.  A memorial service will be held at 0930.  You are ordered to attend."

931, "Next time, try to ensure the safety of your wingmen.  If he requests help, engage the ship that's attacking him."

932, "You left the field of battle before your watch was ended.  This act of cowardice will stain your record for the rest of your military career.

If you can prevent that rendezvous, we'll send in marines in troop transports to capture the freighters and rescue the hostages."

1281, "You conquered three phases of Terran fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  In time, we will expect you to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Good job."

1302, "The Ptolemy was destroyed.  This is a major loss to the Hammer of Light, and a major victory for allied forces."

1303, "The Gateway was destroyed as well.  Good job."

1304, "You allowed all of the escape pods to depart.  Some of the Ptolemy's command staff may have been evacuated.  We are sending fighters to hunt down these pods as we speak."

1313, "Welcome to the GTI

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.  You are now assigned to the GTI's Special Ops destroyer, the Krios.

The primary mission of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of our enemies, specifically the Shivans and the Vasudan insurgency, Hammer of Light.

As a pilot for Special Ops, your missions will involve intelligence gathering and containment.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

1314, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.

We have no word on what became of the Terran pilots that destroyed the Lucifer, or how much of the attack force remains stranded on the Earth side of the node.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth and GTA HQ, an interim GTA Command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

1315, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVN has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.  Furthermore, incidents of violence between Terran and Vasudan military personnel have compounded an already precarious situation."

1316, "Overzealous Pilots

The GTA and the PVN are conducting joint operations in the Vega system.  Though hostilities between allied forces in Vega have been confined to isolated episodes, tensions have now escalated to an all-out confrontation.  During a recent Shivan attack, Terran pilots fired upon Vasudan ships with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the PVN learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the Shivans will soon collapse."

1317, "Mission Classified

This mission has been classified at the highest level.  If you should be killed or captured while fulfilling your objectives, GTI will disavow any knowledge of you or your actions."

1318, "New Technology: Leech Cannon

The secondary mission of the GTI is the research and development of cutting-edge technologies.  As a Special Ops officer, you will have access to advanced weapons and warship prototypes not yet available to GTA pilots.  These systems have undergone extensive lab and field testing and should function as designed.

The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the Leech Cannon to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

1319, "At approximately 1530 hours, Terran and Vasudan fighters repelled a Shivan assault against Outpost Fermi.  During the skirmish, Terran pilots fired on our Vasudan allies with intent to kill."

1320, "The motives of these pilots are unclear.  We do not believe their actions represent a large-scale insurrection within Terran ranks, but the situation must be contained."

1321, "Hostilities have escalated to an all-out confrontation between Terran and Vasudan forces in the area.  A GTI communications terminal in the sector transmitted an encoded message advising command of the situation, which threatens to jeopardize our treaty with the Vasudans."

1322, "Your objective will be to sanitize the area.  Destroy everything but the GTI communications terminal.  All voices must be silenced to preserve the Terran-Vasudan alliance."

1323, "This mission has an operational window of five minutes.  Get in.  Do your job.  Get out.  Good luck, pilot."

1324, "Well done, pilot.  You executed a clean sweep of the area and contained a volatile incident.  A single Vasudan ship escaped, but the GTI will soon liquidate this threat."

1325, "The transport that escaped was too far away from you to be eliminated."

1326, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  This failure will give GTA sufficient evidence to reconstruct the incident.  You have compromised the Terran-Vasudan alliance, and GTA has severed its support of our operations.  You are grounded permanently."

1327, "Destroy all targets within your five-minute window."

1328, "You failed to silence the Vasudan transport.  You have compromised the Terran-Vasudan alliance, and GTA has severed its support of our operations.  You are grounded until further notice."

1329, "Destroy the transport.  Perhaps deploy Beta wing to complete this task while you and Alpha wing engage the other vessels."

1330, "Two targets escaped.  GTI tracked and silenced the first vessel, but the second evaded our forces and informed the Vasudans of our operation.  Your failure has jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans.  You are grounded until further notice."

1331, "Be aware of the positions of all ships in the area.  You cannot afford to let any escape."

1332, "Destroy all witnesses"

1339, "Alpha 1, containment critical.  Aries 2 breaking for the jump node."

1340, "Aries 3 en route to terminal.  Destroy Aries 3, Alpha 1.  Let's keep the Vasudan armada out of this."

1341, "What is going on here pilot?"

1342, "Alpha 1, this mission has been compromised.  Return to base."

1343, "The Pursuit"

1344, "A Vasudan ship, designated Aries 2, escaped our containment operation.  GTI has tracked the vessel to a Vasudan-controlled supply zone."

1345, "Aries 2 has communicated our objectives to Vasudan forces in that sector.  We are jamming all local transmissions, but we must achieve absolute containment."

1346, "Your mission will be to destroy all vessels in the supply zone.  Ignore the cargo.  Preliminary reconnaissance indicates a garrison of two Aten cruisers with fighter escort."

1347, "The loss of innocent lives is regrettable but necessary to preserve the Terran-Vasudan alliance and defeat the Shivans.  You must not fail."

1348, "Excellent work.  You defeated superior forces that intelligence failed to anticipate.  The science vessel's escape pods survived the assault, but GTI will track and eliminate them.  Analysis indicates you had no choice but to avoid the shock wave of the blast.  You exercised good judgment under fire, pilot."

1349, "In order for you to survive you had to leave the escape pods be.  There was no way you could destroy the escape pods and live."

1350, "Aborting a mission without orders is insubordination, pilot.  You will have an opportunity to explain these actions at your court martial tomorrow, at 0800 hours."

1351, "Never abort a mission unless ordered to do so."

1352, "Destroy all enemies"

1358, "Alpha 1, move away from the Einstein!  Sensors reading massive energy surge!"

1359, "Ghosts"

1360, "GTI has located the Einstein's escape pods in the Beta Aquilae sector."

1361, "Command has issued a new directive.  Your mission will be to secure the area and guard the pods.  A retrieval ship will recover the survivors for interrogation."

1362, "We will deploy the retrieval ship as soon as possible.  Defend those pods until you are relieved of duty.  You will receive further orders in Beta Aquilae."

1363, "The incident at Beta Aquilae has us puzzled.  Command acknowledges you had no means of confirming the authorization status of the destroyer.  Under these circumstances, you did excellent work ensuring the recovery of an escape pod."

1364, "Only one escape pod can be rescued in this mission."

1365, "You are grounded until further notice, pilot.  With none of the survivors in our custody, our intelligence efforts are futile."

1366, "Monitor the status of the escape pods."

1367, "You aborted your mission before completion.  You will be required to provide full testimony before a court martial.  Dismissed."

1368, "Escort Einstein Vessels"

1369, "Escort escape pods until retrieval"

1370, "Escape pods, listen up.  Alpha will escort you until the retrieval ship gets here.  If you do not comply, they have orders to open fire."

1372, "Pods, stay clear.  We'll handle this."

1373, "Alpha 1, preparing for pod retrieval.  Maintain escort.  Deploying reinforcements to assist."

1374, "Sucker punch!  Breaking to attack!"

1375, "Alpha 1, this is GTI cruiser Myrmidon.  Deployed for pod retrieval.  What's your status here?"

1376, "Alpha 1, this is Myrmidon.  Pod retrieved.  Returning to base."

1377, "Mission accomplished, Alpha 1.  Bring it on home."

1378, "Sensor malfunction!  Can't read those fighters!"

1379, "On The Run"

1380, "Unknown Fighters

A preliminary analysis of the incident at Beta Aquilae suggests the fighters you engaged possessed advanced stealth technologies.  The origin and intent of this force remain unknown, and Terran Command has ordered a full investigation.  You will be informed of the progress of this inquiry on a need-to-know basis.  Until further notice, you have been reassigned to other GTI operations."

1381, "New Technology: Zeus Bomber

GTI research and development has completed field testing of the Zeus-class strike bomber.  Like the Athena, its predecessor, the Zeus offers excellent speed and maneuverability.  However, more efficient design enables the Zeus to carry Tsunami space bombs in its arsenal.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against Shivan capital ships."

1382, "New Technology: Cluster Bomb

A second-generation Synaptic bomb, GTI's cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against groups or wings of enemy ships.  Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a field of energy blasts, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

1383, "A Shivan offensive has decimated our forces in the Ikeya system.  The enemy annihilated our installations and eighty percent of the fleet garrisoned in that sector.  The survivors are now retreating to secure Terran positions."

1384, "Fortunately, the science cruiser Ratna survived the engagement.  Scientists on board this vessel are spearheading the Eumenides Project and have developed cutting-edge weapon prototypes vital to the war effort."

1385, "The Shivans disabled the Ratna, so the vessel has neither propulsion nor warp capability.  We must retrieve our ship, its scientists, and their prototypes.  Command anticipates Shivan reinforcements will soon resume their offensive."

1386, "Under these circumstances, we must execute a high-risk maneuver to recover the Ratna.  Vasudan transport Gemini will dock with the vessel and tow it away from the Shivan attack point.  The docking seal may not hold, but we have no other viable options."

1387, "Command will deploy additional Terran transports to evacuate the scientists.  We cannot extract the prototypes from the Ratna, so the entire vessel must be recovered."

1388, "Your mission: protect the Ratna.  Repel the Shivan attack so repair crews can get the engines back on line.  The future of this war is in your hands, pilot."

1389, "You held off the enemy so our transports could evacuate the scientists.  We need their expertise to win this war, pilot.  Good work."

1390, "Well done."

1391, "Because of your outstanding performance, we recovered the Ratna and its prototypes.  You should be very proud, pilot.  You saved not only the Eumenides Project but possibly the lives of millions."

1392, "You failed to provide our transports with adequate fighter cover.  As a result, we could neither evacuate the scientists nor retrieve the prototypes.  Technology will win this war, not mediocrity.  Knowledge is power, pilot, and you're flying unarmed.  Dismissed."

1393, "You must keep the enemy fighters away from the Ratna."

1394, "We evacuated our scientists.  However, without the prototypes, Command has terminated the Eumenides Project.  There are no commendations for mediocrity, pilot.  Dismissed."

1409, "Hellfire consists of four cruisers, both Cain and Lilith class, with a fighter escort of ten to fifteen ships."

1410, "Your squad will intercept and destroy as much of the Shivan force as possible.  Beta and Delta will engage the cruisers.  Alpha and Gamma will defend the bomber wings and neutralize the fighter threat."

1411, "Well done, pilot.  Because the Shivan cruisers failed to reach the Delta Serpentis jump node, we anticipate a decisive victory for our forces in that sector."

1412, "You successfully destroyed Hellfire's fighter escort."

1413, "We're at war pilot.  This is no training mission.  Hellfire reached the Delta Serpentis jump node and reinforced the primary Shivan fleet.  Your failure cost us lives and resources we could not afford to lose."

1425, "Should Epsilon 1 fail to accomplish its objective, we will deploy Epsilon 2.  If neither transport succeeds in recovering the Giordano, your orders are to destroy the station and return to base."

1426, "Excellent work.  We recovered the Giordano and its data with only minimal losses."

1427, "Your mission was a success.  We lost Epsilon 1, but recovered the Giordano and its data."

1428, "Your efforts have prevented a critical breach in GTI security.  However, we regret the loss of the Giordano."

1429, "Use some wingmen to protect the transports, and disable the forward turrets of the Ptah."

1430, "The transports failed to recover the Giordano.  The Hammer of Light now has access to data that will compromise GTI operations.  Your gross incompetence has forced command to abort several key missions.  Dismissed, pilot."

1439, "GTI must capture mining materials necessary for the war effort in the middle of an ionized field."

1440, "Unknown Fighters

During recovery of the Einstein's escape pods in Beta Aquilae, unidentified fighters attacked your wing.  The results of our inquiry are puzzling-the vessels are Loki-class fighters, GTI design and manufacture.

GTI research and development created the Loki-class fighter at a top-secret installation, location undisclosed.  The prototype of a stealth fighter project, the Loki is designed to elude detection by all known sensor arrays."

1441, "Unknown Fighters

Analysis of the Beta Aquilae attack has enabled our engineers to exploit a structural weakness in the Loki, thus rendering its stealth technology useless.  We have shared this information with our Vasudan allies, and we anticipate the Shivans will also have the expertise to uncloak the fighter.

The incident does signal an even more disturbing development, however: the emergence of a rogue element within the GTI.  We suspect an insurgent cell has appropriated the Loki for unknown purposes.  However, the secrecy surrounding the stealth project has impeded further inquiry."

1442, "The Einstein

The appearance of the Einstein in the Vega System is also troubling.

According to service logs, the Einstein was destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128, in which the enemy annihilated all Terran ships and installations.  The Einstein had entered the system to conduct a routine geological survey three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Vega during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

1443, "Ross 128

Furthermore, evidence suggests the Einstein may have been a rogue GTI ship.  A high-ranking GTI operative, Captain Ezra Tycho, commanded the science vessel.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.  Analyzing the data we have gathered so far, we believe rogue elements within the GTI may have known about the existence of the Shivan threat prior to the attack on Ross 128."

1444, "Rogue Elements

Therefore, we suspect the Loki-class fighters were engaged in a GTI cover-up.  The attack on your wing in the Beta Aquilae system may have been a botched attempt to destroy evidence of the Einstein's existence.

The extent of the cover-up and the objectives of the conspiracy remain unknown.  You are advised to exercise caution during your next sorties."

1445, "New Technology: Loki Fighter

The latest prototype developed by the GTI stealth project, the Loki features high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability.  Because of a minor structural weakness, the Loki's stealth capability has been compromised.  Nevertheless, the Loki is the most versatile fighter in our arsenal."

1446, "New Technology: S-Breaker

Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon will be effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim.

Use it well."

1447, "Pirates have attacked the Talus Mining Facility.  Because this installation processes materials critical to our warhead production, control of Talus is of the utmost strategic importance."

1448, "The facility's garrison repelled the pirate attack but sustained ninety percent casualties.  Certain volatile materials breached containment during the engagement, and the resulting explosion annihilated the pirate force.  However, the blast also severely compromised the structural integrity of the installation."

1449, "Your primary objective will be to escort our transports while they recover the remaining warhead materials."

1450, "Be advised the explosion released an ionized gas that will render small vessels invisible to sensors.  This will make missile lock impossible on targets within the ionized zone."

1451, "Once the operation has commenced, the facility will begin its evacuation.  However, the cargo must be your first priority.  Only after the materials have been recovered should you protect the escape pods.  We regret any casualties that may result, but the strategic value of the warhead materials necessitates this decision."

1452, "Command will deploy bombers to destroy the facility after all materials and survivors have been recovered."

1453, "Because of heavy subspace activity in the area, we should anticipate a Shivan attack against our operation."

1454, "Well done, pilot.  You ensured the retrieval of all warhead materials and saved the lives of facility personnel."

1455, "Good work, pilot.  You ensured the retrieval of all warhead materials from the Talus Mining Facility."

1456, "You had strict orders, pilot.  Your actions may have seemed humane, but many more lives will be lost without those warhead materials.  Command has no use for pilots who disregard its directives."

1457, "Defend the survivors only after the cargo has been recovered successfully."

1458, "Because of your ineptitude, the pirates now possess critical warhead materials and weapon prototypes.  Furthermore, this catastrophe has bolstered the enemy's morale.  Command anticipates their attacks against our positions will intensify."

1459, "You can defeat the pirates.  Pay attention to where they are going and where they are coming from."

1460, "You skillfully thwarted the pirate assault.  You did well to monitor the status of the transports to prevent materials from falling into enemy hands.  Analysis suggests the pirates no longer pose any viable threat to our military ships and installations."

1461, "Without those materials and prototypes, our capacity to wage war against the Shivans has been compromised.  What happened out there, pilot?  Was it incompetence...or treason?"

To obliterate data gathered about its activities in the Ross 128 system, Galactic Terran Intelligence destroyed the Krios.  Effectively immediately, all surviving personnel are to be reassigned to the GTD Soyakaze."

1517, "The GTI

The conspiracy is not confined to a rogue element within the GTI, but involves officers in the highest echelon of the intelligence directorate.  Although their objectives remain unclear, Command believes the conspirators intend to overthrow the GTA government and dissolve the Terran-Vasudan Treaty.

Galatic Terran Intelligence-its ships, installations, and personnel-are now hostile targets.  Because of the  technology and sensitive information within its grasp, the GTI poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the GTA, the PVN, and all allied worlds.  Our actions must be swift and decisive.

The Soyakaze's primary objective is to locate and destroy the GTI's base of operations."

1518, "Ross 128

The Soyakaze has set course for the Ross 128 system.  Information recovered from the Krios indicates GTI operations are concentrated around the site of the initial Shivan attack.  Our first task will be to investigate this activity."

1519, "Admiral Scott

I will now take this opportunity to honor the late Admiral Scott, commander of the GTD Krios, who died in the line of duty.

Admiral Scott devoted many years of service to the GTI and dedicated himself to its mission: to provide the GTA and its allies with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of its enemies.

His superiors, to whom he had given his trust and loyalty, betrayed Admiral Scott when they abandoned that mission to pursue their corrupt ambitions and designs.  GTI is now the enemy.

Let us never forget the integrity and sacrifice of this fine officer."

1520, "New Technology: EM Pulse Missile

Without the technology and expertise of GTI's research and development branch, we will lack our enemy's cutting-edge weapon systems and ship prototypes.  However, we do have a new addition to the arsenal: the EM Pulse missile.

Upon impact, the EM Pulse disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  The weapon has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also reacquire their target's signature lock."

1521, "We have set course for Ross 128, the site of the first Shivan contact.  GTI operatives have been active in this system, and we must investigate.  Your mission will be to inspect the wreckage from the original Shivan assault."

1522, "Ross 128 is currently under Shivan control.  There are no other Terran forces in this system.  You will need to complete your mission quickly.  Scan the wreckage and return to base."

1523, "Your wing annihilated all GTI vessels.  Fine work.  We suspect the GTI already salvaged the wreckage at Ross 128.  Their objectives in this sector remain unknown."

1524, "We made no strategic gains at Ross 128, but your assault decimated the Shivan garrison.  Nice work."

1525, "Use the Shivans to your advantage against the GTI."

1526, "Elements of the Shivan force escaped.  I should not have to remind you that destroying all hostiles is a high priority.  Winning the battle means nothing if we lose the war."

1527, "Destroy Vishnu"

1532, "Terran vessels are GTI ships.  Engage and destroy all hostiles - GTI and Shivan."

1533, "Hostiles have been neutralized, but sensors are unable to locate wreckage for scanning.  Abort mission and return to base."

1534, "The Wait"

1535, "Reconnaissance reports heavy Shivan traffic through the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Our mission: shut them down."

1536, "Your wing will patrol this area and engage any hostiles.  Seek and destroy."

1537, "You had orders not to destroy the cargo, pilot.  Either you're a slow learner or you're shooting for demotion.  Intelligence needed that cargo for analysis."

1538, "Disable the freighters first, then destroy them after eliminating the other hostiles."

1539, "The Shivans escaped with their cargo.  Apparently their freighters were too fast and maneuverable for you, pilot.  Command is unimpressed with your lack of results."

1540, "Our freighters retrieved the Shivan cargo.  Well done.  Intelligence has begun its analysis, and we hope to learn much about Shivan strategy in this sector."

1541, "We failed to recover all the cargo, but we have sufficient evidence to uncover the Shivan's objective in this sector."

1549, "Command says Shivans have been swarming all over this node."

1550, "Engage and destroy Shivan freighters.  Do not, repeat, do not destroy the cargo.  We will commence retrieval once the area is secured."

1551, "Deploying freighters Priam, Hector, and Paris to retrieve the cargo."

1552, "The freighters can take it from here.  Return to base."

1553, "Alpha, stop wasting time and return to base"

1554, "Back off!  That cruiser's gonna blow!"

1555, "Secrets Revealed"

1556, "GTI Headquarters

We have located the GTI's base of operations- the Jotunheim installation in the Beta Aquilae system.

The full extent of their activities in Beta Aquilae remain unknown.  However, we believe the GTI has been studying Shivan culture and technology at Jotunheim since the massacre at Ross 128."

1557, "GTI Plans

Reconnaissance also has evidence of a large-scale prototype construction involving Shivan technology, but no data regarding the configuration and capability of this vessel could be gathered."

1558, "GTI Technology

GTI forces have access to Shivan armaments as well as the systems created by its research and development branch, so be advised your foe will possess superior technology.  You will have to fly smarter and fight harder to win this battle.

Command suspects the GTI may also have Shivan captives at Jotunheim for the purposes of biological research and the development of viral weapons."

1559, "Hades

Terran Command intercepted a GTI transmission and technical readout relating to a Jotunheim operation with the codename Project Hades.  Cryptographers are in the process of deciphering the transmission, and engineers are analyzing the technical readout.  Although we have nothing conclusive, we must act now."

1560, "Our Mission

The rogue Galactic Terran Intelligence group must be crushed.  These traitors threaten the security of the GTA, the stability of the Terran-Vasudan Alliance, and our future victory over the Shivans.  Report for your mission briefing, pilot."

1561, "Reconnaissance has uncovered the location of GTI's primary base of operations, the Jotunheim.  Details concerning the strength of the garrison remain sketchy.  GTA will launch an immediate, all-out offensive and deploy reinforcements as soon as possible."

1562, "Failure is not an option.  The GTI conducts weapons research on the Jotunheim, so be prepared to engage exotic prototypes with unknown capabilities."

1563, "Your cowardice jeopardized our best opportunity to eliminate the GTI threat.  Once operational, the Shivan-Terran hybrid will be invincible.  Dismissed, pilot."

1564, "Protect your bombers and keep your wingmen focused."

1565, "Excellent work!  Our initiative caught the GTI off guard.  Preliminary scans indicate the GTI possessed Shivan defensive technologies.  If that juggernaut had gone on line, GTI would be writing the history books."

1566, "For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of your own life, you have distinguished yourself above and beyond the call of duty in the highest traditions of military service.  You are hereby awarded the Galactic Service Medal, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the Galactic Terran Alliance."

1567, "That sucked, didn't it?  Well, if you share our feelings that Silent Threat had potential that it never managed to live up to, then you might like to try Silent Threat: Reborn.  ST:R is the Port team's reimagined and reinterpreted version of Silent Threat, with improved missions, a deeper plot, more immersion, and plenty of ties to FreeSpace 2!

1584, "Terran Command has initiated Operation Fury, a renewed offensive against Shivan positions in the Capella system.  Phase 1: eliminate all hostiles and secure the Vega system.  Reconnaissance has located a Hammer of Light cruiser group, comprised of two Aten-class warships, en route to the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Our task force has been deployed to engage and destroy this threat.  The Fenris-class Mjollnir and the Leviathan-class Dionysos will provide support for the assault."

1585, "Sensors indicate a Terran cruiser group on intercept course.  Engage and destroy the Mjollnir and Dionysos warships."

1586, "Our task force secured the Vega system, and Command has issued the go-ahead for Phase 2 of Operation Fury.  Excellent work, pilot."

1587, "You destroyed only one Aten warship.  Command has suspended Operation Fury until a more proficient force can secure the Vega system.  Anything less than total victory is unacceptable."

1588, "Guard your bombers and keep your wingmen focused."

1589, "Because of your failure, Command has scrapped Operation Fury.  With officers like you, the alliance needs no enemies."

1590, "Hammer of Light destroyed the Mjollnir and the Dionysos.  You are grounded pending a full investigation.  Dismissed, pilot."

1591, "Excellent work, pilot.  You destroyed the Mjollnir and the Dionysos."

1592, "A Terran warship survived the battle.  You failed to destroy both cruisers."

1593, "The Mjollnir and the Dionysos survived the battle.  You failed to destroy the Terran cruisers."

GTI scientists are now in the process of developing a warhead-viable containment system for the Serkr's volatile core."

1602, "Your objective is to destroy the Ragnarok and its Orion-class escort, the Heimdall.  For the sake of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, the Serkr project must be terminated."

1603, "Outstanding, pilot!  You destroyed the Ragnarok and the Heimdall.  Your efforts have terminated the GTI's Serkr project."

1604, "You destroyed the Ragnarok and terminated the GTI's Serkr project.  Command regrets you failed to eliminate the Heimdall, but you achieved your primary objective."

1605, "You are a disgrace, pilot.  The Ragnarok and the Heimdall escaped.  If GTI succeeds in stabilizing the Serkr warhead, every capital ship in the Terran-Vasudan alliance will be at risk.  Dismissed."

1615, "Terran intelligence has received the coordinates of the Apophis, a Hammer of Light Typhon-class destroyer.  Your mission: ambush and obliterate this vessel."

1616, "The commander of the Apophis is Admiral Kek, the highest-ranking officer to defect since the formation of the Terran-Vasudan alliance and the HOL insurgency."

1617, "Deep-cover Vasudan operatives within Hammer of Light have advised intelligence of the destroyer's location.  Because we are the alliance force in closest proximity to these coordinates, command has ordered the GTD Hephaestus to launch an immediate attack."

1618, "The Epona has also been deployed to assist and will reinforce our assault once the cruiser is in position."

1619, "Expect to encounter heavy resistance.  Admiral Kek inspires absolute loyalty in his followers.  We must be willing to make any sacrifice necessary to destroy the Apophis."

1620, "Excellent work, pilot.  You destroyed the Apophis, and the GTD Hephaestus sustained only minor damage.  Command anticipates the death of Admiral Kek will undermine the morale and strategic leadership of Hammer of Light."

1621, "You eliminated Admiral Kek and his capital ship.  However, the GTD Hephaestus sustained heavy damage.  Extensive repairs will be required before we bring the ship back on line.  This may compromise allied operations in this sector."

1622, "Use some wingmen to defend the Hephaestus."

1623, "Command deeply regrets the loss of the GTD Hephaestus and its crew.  However, our task force accomplished its objective.  With the death of Admiral Kek and the destruction of the Apophis, the alliance has achieved a significant victory over Hammer of Light."

1624, "Command has ordered court-martial proceedings, pilot.  What should have been a triumph for the alliance resulted in humiliating defeat.  Admiral Kek and the Apophis destroyed the GTD Hephaestus and escaped."

The Vasudan ship has sustained minor damage, but the Shivans have them outgunned.  Our mission: destroy the hostiles and save the Vasudan cruiser."

1632, "You saved the PVD Serket and obliterated the Shivans.  The Serket was able to complete its operations in the Deneb system, and the Vasudan admiralty has extended its gratitude.  Well done, pilot."

1633, "You neutralized the Shivan cruiser group, but the PVD Serket was destroyed.  Command has sent its regrets to the Vasudan admiralty.  Dismissed, pilot."

1634, "Use some wingmen to defend the Serket."

1635, "You are an embarrassment to the Terran fleet, pilot.  The Shivan destroyer vaporized the PVD Serket and escaped.  This failure may damage our alliance with the Vasudans, and you are grounded until further notice.  Dismissed."

1641, "There are 3 subspace nodes in this sector.  They lead to Vasuda, Aldebaran, and Sirius.  Civilians will be transported from Vasuda to Aldebaran."

1642, "Our warships will travel to and from both the Sirius and Vasuda jump points."

1643, "Because of the strategic importance of this system, we expect the Shivans to try to secure it quickly.  You will ensure the safe passage of all Allied vessels in the area.  Additional orders will be sent to you as they arise."

1644, "You did an outstanding job in protecting our transports.  We were able to save countless lives.  You should feel proud of this accomplishment."

1645, "You were also able to keep the area secured until we established a stronger foothold in the system.  Well done."

1646, "Far too many ships were lost in this evacuation operation.  This is a great blow to our people.  It is unfortunate that you were unable to do more to help those refugees."

1647, "Protect all of the ships in the area.  Make sure every group of ships is protected by either you or your wingmen.  Kill the bombers as fast as possible with your hornets."

1648, "However, we were not able to secure the area because you left your post before you were relieved."

1649, "Remain in the area until Zeta arrives to relieve you.  If worse comes to worse, Delta wing is available for reinforcements."

1650, "You were also unable to secure the area against future Shivan attacks.  It will be very difficult to retake this sector of space."

1651, "Remain in the area until Zeta wing has arrived to relieve you.  If you are having difficulty staying alive that long, make sure you manage your shields well.  If worse comes to worse, you may call in Delta wing to assist you."

1652, "What we are most impressed with, however, is your protection of each and every ship.  We did not lose a single freighter or transport, and the Mecross is safe from Shivan bombers.

This is truly an amazing accomplishment, and for this we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

1653, "It is unfortunate that the Mecross was destroyed during the battle.  Her loss is keenly felt.  We realize the odds were stacked against you, and we do not hold you responsible."

1654, "The Mecross can be saved.  Try to kill the Nephilims as fast as you can.  Also make sure you shoot down any incoming bombs.  Save your hornets if possible and use them as soon as you get a lock."

1655, "We did lose a few refugee ships during this evacuation operation."

1656, "Saving every ship requires good communication.  Make sure every ship is always guarded by you or your wingmen.  Use your hornets on bombers and don't let them get too close to the freighters.  Make sure all of your wingmen are always doing something."

1657, "We are pleased you were able to use Delta wing to accomplish all of your objectives.  However, you should try to keep your use of reinforcements at a minimum.  If every wing leader requested reinforcements at every opportunity, we would run out of fighters."

1705, "We are the last wing available to help cover the Hope while it is being repaired.  The Terrans are sending a few of their own fighters to stand guard over the Hope, but it will be some time before they arrive."

1706, "We do not believe the Shivans have enough forces in the system to mount a serious attack, but their strategies are difficult to predict.  Good luck."

1707, "Well done, Pilot.  This mission was quite a bit more intense than we had expected, thanks to the Shivans.  Fortunately you were able to hang on until the reinforcements arrived.  Very impressive."

1708, "For protecting one of the few remaining Vasudan Typhon-class destroyers, you are awarded the medal of Conspicuous Gallantry.  Wear it proudly."

1709, "You failed to protect the Hope.  Even though we were not expecting an attack from the Shivans, you needed to protect that ship.  Due to your failure, our hold on this sector becomes even more tenuous.  We all have to perform beyond our abilities in this war, Pilot.  Dismissed!"

1742, "Fortunately you were able to save some of the escape pods.  The survivors thank you and look forward to the chance to avenge the destruction of the Aquilae."

1743, "Protecting all the escape pods is most impressive.  The survivors thank you and hope we can avenge the destruction of the Aquilae."

1744, "By protecting the Beta Aquilae Communications Terminal we are able to keep in contact with our forces in the outer systems.  Losing the communication terminal would have been a severe blow.  Well done pilot.

For continued service to the Alliance, we are awarding you the Good Conduct Medal.  Keep it up."

1745, "We lost many escape pods in the battle as well.  Such a loss of life is difficult to bear.  Several key scientists were unable to evacuate the installation.  They, and their research, will be sorely missed."

1746, "You should try to stay near the escape pods and destroy any shivan fighters that attack them.  Sacrificing one or two pods so the rest can make it is a wise choice which you may have to make."

1771, "The Zenith is currently on patrol with just two wings of Shivan fighters, the Arjuna interceptors, and the Rama superiority fighters.  However, we believe they are able to call in reinforcements."

1772, "Your primary objective will be to destroy the Zenith.  Take out the Zenith's communications system first to prevent it from calling in reinforcements.  If you're unable to do that, go after all weapons systems, including turrets and missile launchers."

1773, "Alpha wing will provide cover for the bombers.  Gamma wing will assist Alpha and will attempt to take out the communications system on Zenith.  Beta will be equipped with Tsunami bombs, and will be targeting suspected weak points on the Zenith's hull."

1774, "You failed to destroy the Zenith.  We will have quite a bit of difficulty continuing this operation."

1775, "If you can't beat the Zenith, try to first eliminate all Dragons in the area, then go straight for the Zenith's comms.  Once the comms are out, target the weapons system and then allow your bombers to finish him off."

1776, "Congratulations on destroying the Zenith.  It is now time to begin the next stage of this operation."

1794, "Omega wing will dock with the Rosetta as soon as they arrive.  Oversee this personnel transfer, then escort Omega 1 and Omega 2 to the jump node."

1795, "You managed to get both transports to the Altair system.  If the information at Altair IV proves as valuable as the Vasudan refugees suspect, then the Terran and Vasudan people will owe you a great debt.  Well done, pilot."

1796, "A crucial transport was lost.  We hope the one that managed to get through will be adequate to recover the information from Altair IV.  We relied on you to safeguard the transit of the scientists and you were only marginally successful.  We expect better in the future."

1797, "Forget Rosetta.  Getting those two transports out alive is far more important.  You have to take out those heavy attack basilisks as fast as possible, before they launch their streams of swarm missiles."

1798, "Both transports were destroyed.  You were entrusted with a mission of enormous importance and you failed.  Dismissed."

1799, "Forget Rosetta.  Concentrate on saving those transports.  Kill the Basilisks as fast as possible unless you want Omega to eat all kinds of missiles for dinner.  Make sure all your wingmen are under your control.  You need to make sure every fighter is doing its job."

1800, "The crew of the Rosetta sends their thanks.  When the Lucifer jumped in, they all but gave up hope of survival.  Your squadron was able to hold off the enemy and that is most impressive.  For this, you are awarded the Commendation Medal."

1825, "Unfortunately, the Altair system is still controlled by the Hammer of Light.  One of their flagships, the Anvil, is stationed here, and has gotten word of our presence in this system.  It is currently blocking the vector to the subspace node."

1826, "The Anvil carries with it a powerful contingent of Vasudan fighters.  Intelligence reports two squadrons: one of advanced Thoth space superiority fighters, and one of Horus Interceptors.  These fighters have defended the Anvil well."

1827, "Intelligence has also detected the presence of a third wing of Vasudan bombers in the system.  They will undoubtedly try to attack our fleeing transports."

1828, "Intelligence has also detected the presence of a third wing of Vasudan bombers in the system.  They will undoubtedly try to attack our fleeing transport."

1829, "Your strike force will once again consist of Alpha, Beta and Gamma wings.  Gamma will provide escort for Alpha while Alpha attacks the Anvil.  Beta will ensure the safety of the transports and maintain our fighter superiority."

1830, "The Anvil must be destroyed.  We are equipping Alpha with Harbinger bombs.  These bombs require exact placement and careful maneuvering, but will do massive damage to the Anvil.  Beta and Gamma must ensure that the Harbingers reach their target."

1831, "Our primary goal, however, is to ensure that Omega 1 and Omega 2 reach the jump node.  Destroying the Anvil is the best way to ensure that this goal is accomplished.  This mission is of grave importance.  Do not fail, Pilot.  Good luck."

1832, "Our primary goal, however, is to ensure that Omega 1 reaches the jump node.  Destroying the Anvil is the best way to ensure that this goal is accomplished.  This mission is of grave importance.  Do not fail, Pilot.  Good luck."

There is nothing we can do from here.
Dismissed."

1834, "If worse comes to worst, let Omega 2 die, and go straight for the Leo bombers.  Once you've destroyed the Leos, you can simply order everyone to engage fighters, and you should have little trouble escorting Omega 1 to the jump node."

1835, "Mission accomplished, Pilot.  We haven't yet been briefed on the full importance of the ancient records, but Terran Command is extremely pleased.  Further orders are expected soon."

1836, "At least we were able to save one of the transports.  We lost half the data, but the half you retrieved just might be enough.  In ordinary circumstances, we'd reprimand you pilot.  But in these circumstances we have no choice but to put you back into battle.  The final conflict looms.  All our forces are gathering for a last counterstrike."

1837, "If you are having trouble keeping both transports alive, keep this in mind:  The Leo squadron of bombers has only 4 bombers.  Destroy them as quick as possible, and you are free to worry about Omega 2.  If you can't destroy the Typhon, at least try to disable it with disruptor missiles while Omega 2 flies by."

1838, "It is impressive that you managed to destroy a primary flagship of the Hammer of Light.  Perhaps this will put an end to their resistance.  Fighting the Hammer of Light has been a great strain on the Terran-Vasudan alliance."

1855, "There will be 5 waves of Shivan enemies.  Each wave will be comprised of 3 to 6 groups of enemy ships.  After clearing the final wave, you will have run the Gauntlet.  Doing so will win you a certain level of honor and privilege within the League of Defense.  Good luck, Pilot."

1856, "While you were able to survive the first phase of Shivan enemies, you were unable to meet the challenge presented to you by the other waves.  Your performance was what we would expect from a rookie fresh from flight school.  If this is how you fight, pray you get a desk job."

1857, "You were able to survive two phases of Shivan enemies before you evacuated the Gauntlet.  This was a marginally satisfactory performance, one that we might expect from an Alliance reserve pilot.  Don't worry about your job security, though.  The Alliance is always in need of cannon fodder."

1858, "You conquered three phases of Shivan fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attmept to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

1893, "Terran Intelligence is certain that there are four small attack wings responsible for the attacks on our convoys."

1894, "You are to sweep the asteroid field and take out the four Vasudan attack wings.  Be aware that the asteroids will be causing interference with your sensors.  You won't be able to target the Vasudans until they are near, but they won't see you either."

1895, "If you encounter the Vasudan ace, you may use your discretion as to whether or not to engage him.  Keep in mind that your primary objective is to take out the four attack wings.  Check your loadouts and commit when ready."

1896, "Nicely done, pilot.  By destroying the Vasudan attack wings you have helped to ensure that our convoys will make it through this subspace node."

1898, "We are awarding you the Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment."

1899, "Since you were unable to take out the Vasudan attack wings, other pilots will need to risk their lives to do your job.  We need results from pilots like you if we expect to keep a foothold in these systems.  Dismissed!"

1900, "Don't get too far ahead of your wingmen, or they won't be able to assist you.  If you get in trouble, use the Comm menu to request cover.

Using missiles on the Vasudans early on can make it easier to take them out with guns.

If you are having trouble finding the Vasudans, try flying towards their general vicinity by following your radar.  If you wait long enough, they'll probably come to you."

1901, "We understand that you did not engage the Vasudan Ace.  It is understandable, given the skill of your opponent.  Still, it would have been a blow to the Vasudans' morale if he had been defeated."

Unfortunately, the contents of this cargo were stolen by a traitor, flying the Omega transport.  These prototypes will need to be recovered."

He has also managed to steal the plans for the Avenger prototype cannon.  These need to be recovered immediately.

The Galatea has received a full complement of the new Valkyrie Interceptor Fighters.

Some of you may remember the Angel Scout Fighter.  It has been completely modified and fitted with two additional engines, making it the fastest fighter in the fleet.  It has been re-designated the Valkyrie.  It should enable you to make short work of enemy fighters.

1983, "After the Comet and the Omega have left the area, it is your responsibility to eliminate any remaining hostiles.  Once the area is clear, you are to jump back to the Galatea."

1984, "Note that you will be required to engage Terran pilots.  These pilots are traitors to the Alliance, and no quarter should be given.  Thousands of lives are at stake.  Do not hesitate to use deadly force on the traitors.  They are your enemy."

1985, "If you encounter significant resistance or experience severe losses, $f Delta wing will be sent by Terran Command to assist.  If further assistance is needed, call in $f Epsilon wing, as well.  Good luck, pilot."

1986, "We wanted McCarthy taken alive, Pilot.  Your squad's lack of control is disturbing.  We are not pleased with this."

1987, "Make sure you use your disruptors when trying to disable McCarthy.  They do minimal damage to a ship's hull, while inflicting normal damage on its electronics and subsystems.  Once Omega is disabled, hostile ships may try to destroy him.  Make sure they do not."

The Vasudans will surely use this against us in future encounters."

1990, "Make sure you disable the Omega as soon as possible in order to recover the prototype.  Once the Omega's engines are destroyed, the GTT Comet will arrive and capture the Omega."

These ships are not detectable by our sensors.  Worse, they appear to have some type of energy-shielding system, making them nearly immune to our attacks.

But the greatest concern is their weapons.  They are more powerful than anything in the GTA or VPE arsenal.

We believe the data you gathered will prove valuable in discovering a weakness in this new adversary."

Terran Command has confirmed the existence of a new species.  Until further contact is established, Command has designated them ''Shivans''.

The Shivans have inflicted heavy casualties to both Terran and Vasudan forces in the Beta Cygni and Vega systems, and appear to be making a rapid push into other key systems along the Terran-Vasudan front.  All contact has been lost with our forces in the Ikeya and Ross 128 systems."

2067, "$b The $b Vasudans

The Vasudan government has contacted the GTA and proposed a cease fire.  Considering the reports regarding the Vasudan and Terran losses to the Shivans, this should not come as a surprise.

Terran Command has not yet responded.

Expect to hear more from Terran Command on this later today."

2068, "$b Hostile $b Contacts

All Shivan forces should be considered a serious threat.

You are authorized to engage any Shivan ship that stands in the way of your mission objectives.

Attempts to establish communication with the Shivans have failed.  Intelligence will continue its attempts to learn more about this new adversary."

2069, "$b Shivan $b Technologies

What little information has been learned about Shivan technology concerns their fighter shielding system.  This shield system makes them nearly impervious to our ML-16 Laser.

R&D is currently modifying the Avenger Prototype cannon to make it more useful against the shields.

Additionally, our fighters cannot target their ships due to our lack of data regarding the Shivan electronics systems.  Plans are currently underway to remedy this situation."

Terran Intelligence is working around the clock to give us more information.

Until then, we have been ordered to move into the Beta Cygni system and monitor any activity."

2071, "Due to increased encounters with Shivan forces, Terran Command has ordered the Galatea to the Beta Cygni system to monitor Shivan activity.  The Galatea has taken quite a beating since her last repair, and there isn't time to follow the safest route."

2072, "The Antares-Beta Cygni Jump Node lies in the center of a dense asteroid field, making it one of the least used jump nodes in the galaxy.  Standard procedure would have us circumvent this node completely, requiring two jumps.  Now we have no choice."

2074, "Alpha Wing will fly point for the $f Galatea and destroy any asteroids that cross its flight path."

2075, "Asteroids that are considered a threat to the $f Galatea will be marked by white targeting brackets.  Destroy these asteroids first."

2076, "Once the Galatea has jumped out, you are to report to the $f GTD $f Bastion, stationed in Antares.  The $f Bastion will take you to Ikeya for your next mission.  Your wing will rendezvous with the $f Galatea in Beta Cygni upon completion of that mission."

2077, "In the event of enemy attack, you are to cover the Galatea's escape from the system at any cost."

2078, "Abandoning the Galatea in an asteroid field was an inexplicable act of cowardice.  The Galatea has been destroyed and you are to blame.  You are hereby stripped of all rank and duties."

2079, "Stay in the area until the Galatea can depart.  If you are having trouble staying alive long enough, try flying slower and using thrusters to control your speed.  Asteroids are often much farther than they seem."

2080, "The destruction of the Galatea is a major loss for the Terran Alliance.

Thousands of lives were lost due to your poor execution.

Perhaps this task should have been given to a more skilled pilot.  You are hereby stripped of all rank and duties in the GTA."

2081, "If the Galatea takes too many asteroid hits, it will not survive.  Concentrate on the asteroids with the white targeting brackets.  The Galatea's turrets will also fire on the asteroids.  Don't waste time with the ones the Galatea is firing on.

Pay special attention to the area around the subspace node.  Asteroids in this area pose a greater threat to the Galatea.

If the Galatea is being destroyed by the Shivans, try shooting down their bombs after they have been launched."

2082, "The Galatea made it to Beta Cygni, but our reports show it took serious damage.  It will be in repair for at least three days.

It's a pity you couldn't better protect it, but what's done is done.  Report to briefing at 0800."

2083, "Protecting it from every asteroid may not be possible, but you should try to keep the Galatea above 70% hull.

Once the bombers come in, shooting down a few of their bombs will save the Galatea from a lot of damage."

2104, "At least five cargo depots of unknown origin have been located here in Ikeya.  These cargo formations are different than any Vasudan and Terran formation, and are believed to belong to the Shivans."

2105, "Reconnaissance indicates that the depot is protected by six sentry guns on the outer edges.  This depot provides a prime opportunity to gather more information about the Shivans.  Their offensive activity in this system is at a minimum, and we do not believe that they will make a serious attempt to defend this depot."

2106, "Long range scanners indicate that some of these cargo containers contain unusual electronics.  They appear to be similar to those used to give the Shivans their shielding technology.  A short range scan of these containers is the primary objective in this operation."

2107, "Further reconnaissance indicates another container group may contains parts for a Shivan sensor array.  A short range scan of this group should provide crucial data needed to adjust ship sensors to attain radar lock on Shivan fighters.  Scanning those containers is your secondary objective."

2108, "You will jump in approximately six kilometers from the cargo depot.  Proceed to the cargo depot quickly, and eliminate all sentry guns.  This will enable our freighters to collect the cargo after you have scanned it."

Your hearing is scheduled for 0700."

2110, "At least try to meet your objectives.  Sometimes that's all it takes."

2111, "Despite the Shivan ambush, you had a mission to accomplish.  Your orders were to remain in the area, unless ordered to leave by Terran Command.

Your defiance of these orders has wasted a prime opportunity."

2112, "Once the Shivans have sprung their trap, stealth is no longer an option.

Use your afterburners as much as possible, and attempt to scan the cargo containers.  Your wingmen will do their best to cover you."

2113, "It is fortunate that you were able to escape the Shivan trap.  Your persistence in obtaining the data we needed is commendable.

While you were unable to gather the shield data, another of our Ikeya task forces was successful in acquiring it.

The data you did gather about Shivan sensor technology will be vital in combating the Shivan forces.  Our technicians now believe they will be able to implement a targeting solution for Shivan ships.

Good work, pilot."

2114, "The Shivans protected the shield technology too well.  There was nothing you could do to acquire it."

2115, "Your success in acquiring the shield technology against such overwhelming odds has indicated to us that you are, in truth, working with the Shivans.  Your interrogation is scheduled for 0930.  You will be escorted to the brig."

The GTA has signed a cease-fire and non-aggression pact with the Vasudans.  Command has already expressed great relief, largely due to the huge drain on military and economic resources the war has caused in the past few years.

The end of a 14-year war should bring peace.  Unfortunately there is no time to breathe easy.

Unfortunately, not all Vasudan forces have agreed to the cease-fire.  Reports have been received of attacks by a rogue group of Vasudans calling themselves the ''Hammer of Light''.

Hammer of Light (HOL) appears to be willfully aiding the Shivan cause, citing some Vasudan legend about the coming of an all-powerful race.

In appreciation of your fine performance in our first operation with allied Vasudans, we are awarding you the Vasudan Alliance Medal."

2230, "The Taranis is heading for the Beta Cygni subspace node, where it will probably resupply.  This will allow for a small window of opportunity in which to conduct a strike."

2231, "The Taranis is heading for the Beta Cygni subspace node, where we expect it to mount an offensive.  This only allows a small window of opportunity in which to conduct a preemptive strike."

2232, "Your primary objective is to disable and disarm the $h Taranis in order to enable its capture.  This will be our first attempt to capture a major Shivan vessel.  Three wings will be assigned to this task."

2233, "Alpha Wing will be flying Athena bombers.  These bombers just arrived on the Galatea and are equipped with the new Stiletto bomb.  The Stiletto is capable of destroying subsystems in one hit.  Alpha's primary responsibility will be to disarm and disable the Taranis."

2234, "Beta Wing is assigned to escort Alpha and protect it from fighter attacks.  Beta will fly Apollo-class fighters."

2235, "Gamma wing will fly Valkyries and should engage any hostile fighters and bombers in the area.  If needed elsewhere, they can be assigned to any task that you see fit."

2237, "Do not allow the $h Taranis to escape or be destroyed.

Good luck."

2238, "The purpose of this mission was to capture a major Shivan vessel for analysis.  It was imperative to the war effort.  Your failure is unforgivable.

Perhaps one day you will learn that the consequences of your actions affect others.  Until that time, you are dismissed from all duties."

2239, "To disable the Taranis without destroying it, you must employ weapons that do very little hull damage.  Your best alternative would probably have been Stiletto bombs and Disruptor lasers.

If the Shivan wing Rama is destroying the cruiser, pursue and distract them.  Use your wingmen to help take them out."

2240, "The Taranis has escaped to the Beta Cygni system.

Not only has the chance to capture a Shivan cruiser been lost, but the Taranis is certain to wreak havoc in other systems.

You were ordered to disable the Taranis.  Inability to follow simple orders makes it clear that you do not belong on the Galatea.  You are hereby dismissed from all duties."

2241, "Destroying the Taranis' engine subsystem is your first, and most important task.

If the Shivan fighters are stopping you, have Beta and Gamma wing cover you while you make runs at the Taranis.

If you absolutely can't make it through, tell your wingmen to disable the Taranis.  A few well placed Stilettos should make short work of the engines."

2242, "You departed before ensuring the capture of the Taranis.  The Omega transports you left unprotected were destroyed by Shivan fighters.

Our hopes of capturing the Taranis were ruined by your carelessness.

Your career is over, Pilot."

2243, "Disarming the Taranis might seem difficult, but if you are careful about it, it shouldn't be too difficult.

Once disabled, the Taranis will be unable to move, making disarming it much easier.

Take out its Missile Launchers first, then the weapons subsystem.  This will hamper the accuracy of its remaining turrets, and give you ample time to take them out."

This may take awhile, but it is your duty to oversee the process, and to protect the ships involved.

If this gets too difficult, you may call in Delta wing to assist you."

2246, "Congratulations, Alpha 1.  You were instrumental in the first capture of a major Shivan vessel!

The Halkins is taking her to the Tombaugh station, where engineers will be able to study their technology and learn more about their methods and motives.

$b * $b Ribos $b System
$b * $b 2/11/35

$b Tombaugh $b Station $b Attack

We've just received some discouraging news from Terran Command, pilots.  At 0300 today, after the captured Taranis was towed to Tombaugh installation in the Ribos system, the Shivans staged a major ambush.  There isn't a lot of confirmation from the footage yet, but it's clear that a Shivan destroyer of massive proportions jumped in and destroyed Tombaugh station, along with all its defenses.  We have designated this new class of Destroyer ''Lucifer''.

Debris from the station is still falling from orbit on Ribos IV."

2270, "$b The $b Lucifer

Terran and Vasudan fighters and cruisers engaged the Lucifer, but were wiped out quickly.  Footage suggests that the Lucifer was using a new type of shield, impervious to any of our attacks.  Needless to say, this is grim news.  If the Shivans indeed have managed to shield a vessel of that magnitude, it's merely a matter of time before they wipe out all front-line installations and march through to our home systems."

2271, "$b Diplomacy

Since all attempts at communication with the Shivans have ended in violence, it appears unlikely that a diplomatic solution will work."

2272, "$b System $b Status

At this point, the Shivans have control of Beta Cygni, Betelgeuse, Ross 128, Ikeya, and Regulus.  Most of the Vasudan forces are gathering in Vega for a counterstrike, while we are gathering our fleet in Antares for an effort to retake Ribos and Beta Cygni.  Oddly enough, the Shivans don't seem to be interested in taking control of any planets in the systems, or gathering natural resources.  Instead they seem to be focused on controlling individual jump nodes."

2273, "$b New $b Technology: $b Flail $b Cannon

Research and Development teams at Sol have recently completed development on a few new weapons.

A group of Terran scientists has returned from a previously unexplored system known as Laramis, and bring with them a new weapon called the Flail.

The Flail is quite different from our typical energy cannons.  Please consult the weapons database in the Tech Room for more details."

2274, "$b New $b Technology: $b Interceptor $b Missile

Our communications with Vasudan technicians have yielded the Interceptor missile.  By combining the Vasudan-designed engine with a Terran warhead, we were able to produce the most powerful anti-fighter weapon yet.  It's an aspect-seeking missile, and requires a few seconds to lock onto the enemy's engine signature, but its speed and accuracy make it lethal.  Use it well."

2275, "The survivors of the Tombaugh attack must be evacuated from the Ribos system immediately.  We do not have sufficient firepower to retake Ribos at this time.  Your wing's objective is to escort the Iota transports."

2276, "Other wings will be accompanying this convoy.  Alpha wing will be in charge of this operation and will have command authority."

2277, "The convoy must reach the designated checkpoint.  Escort from this point onward will be provided by allied Vasudan forces, led by the PVD Pinnacle."

2278, "Hostile forces have been spotted all over this system, and there is a good chance that our convoy will be attacked by Shivan fighters."

2279, "All hostile forces should be eliminated."

2280, "The $f PVD $f Pinnacle will be arriving at the designated check point.  This Typhon class destroyer has one of the most skilled crews in the PVE.  It will escort the refugees for the remainder of their journey."

2281, "Help the Pinnacle until it has dismissed you, then return to base.  Many lives depend on this operation.  Good luck."

2282, "Your primary objective was to escort the transports to the rendezvous with the Pinnacle.  They were destroyed and hundreds of innocent lives were lost.  Such failure cannot be tolerated in the GTA."

2283, "Always make sure that Iota wing is protected.  Attack all ships that attack your transports, and try not to get too far behind them.  If you are still having difficulty protecting them, try equipping your ship with a Flail cannon.  If you survive long enough, the Pinnacle will arrive to assist you."

2284, "Great job, Alpha 1.  You managed to save all three of the Iota transports from the Shivan attacks.  We were told by the crew of the Pinnacle to congratulate you on a job well done.  The civilians on those transports owe you their lives as well."

2285, "You safely escorted some of the refugees in Iota and for that you are to be commended.  It is unfortunate that so many had to lose their lives.  They will be mourned."

2286, "Protecting all 3 transports is extremely difficult.  You may have to assign individual ships to protect individual transports."

2287, "Epsilon lost all of Omega wing.  The Shivan war machine is fast taking its toll on our population."

2288, "Asking for Epsilons help can have dire consequences."

2289, "Beta could not protect Sigma wing, and all of the Sigma transports were destroyed.  Admiral Halkins, a 10 year veteran of the war and a great soldier, was on Sigma.  He will be greatly missed."

2299, "Did you see what was left of Ribos?"

2313, "The crew of the GTC Ravage thanks you for saving their lives.  The Shivans will find their assault on Antares far more difficult with the Ravage on board.

For saving the crew of the GTC Ravage, we are awarding you the Medal of Conspicuous Gallantry."

2314, "The destruction of the GTSC Asimov has struck a major blow to our attempts to preserve this sector.  Due to the loss of the Asimov's data, Project Tsunami is no more.

Without it, we have no chance of destroying enough major Shivan vessels to win this war."

2315, "Protecting the Asimov requires that you do not let any of the Shivan bombers near it.  There are plenty of Shivan fighters in the area, but you must ignore them and go for the bombers first.  Target the Shaitans and destroy them as fast as possible with your Interceptors."

2450, "The Shivans are leaving their cargo behind!"

2451, "You were clearly ordered to NOT destroy the cargo!  Pilots, secure the area and jump back to base."

2452, "We've got four Shivan freighters with cargo and two transports in the area."

2453, "The Eva jumped out before we could reach it."

2454, "Alpha and Beta, try to destroy the freighters without destroying the cargo."

2455, "GTT Harmon moving in to dock with Shivan cargo."

2456, "GTT Marcos docking with Shivan cargo now."

$b * $b Deneb $b System
$b * $b 2/20/35

$b Our $b Orders

We are under general quarters because a fighter patrol detected advance ships from the Lucifer fleet approaching Vasuda Prime.

Somehow, the Shivan forces have circumvented our blockade at Antares, and now control the Deneb system.  We are en route to Deneb as we speak.  ETA is thirty-five minutes, so when you leave here, report to your wing station for immediate mission briefings.

The Lucifer itself is behind the vanguard force, so we can expect it to make an appearance at any time."

2462, "$b New $b Technology: $b Ulysses $b Advanced $b Fighter

The Vasudan-Terran Ulysses project has been completed, and the Galatea has received a complement of these fighters.  It is the most maneuverable craft ever developed by the PVN or the GTA, and it should be extremely useful in this next series of sorties.  It can also be equipped with the Prometheus cannon, the most powerful cannon weapon we've ever developed.  Use them both well."

2463, "$b Capturing $b a $b Shivan $b Fighter

Intelligence has concocted a daring plan to enable us to learn more about the Shivans.  We are going to attempt to capture a Shivan fighter.  Suit up and report to your wing stations for briefings immediately."

2464, "The Shivans have established quite a base of operations in the Deneb system.  They have multiple supply depots scattered across the system, as well as several repair centers for their damaged fighters."

2465, "Each of their repair stations consists of a Cain-class cruiser and extra supplies.  The Shakti is one such cruiser in the area."

2466, "All fighters in the area around the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets.  One of our objectives in this mission is to put this repair station out of commission.  This will greatly reduce Shivan capability in the Deneb system."

2467, "All the fighters in the area near the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets."

2468, "One of the fighters being repaired by the Shakti is a Dragon-class fighter, designated '$h Arjuna $h 1'.  The Dragon is the Shivans' most maneuverable craft, and the most dangerous."

2469, "Intelligence has requested that we capture the Dragon for research purposes.  Since the Arjuna 1 Dragon is very low on power, it is in a weakened state, and is the best candidate for this operation.  You must disable Arjuna 1 by destroying its engine subsystem."

2470, "Once Arjuna 1 has been disabled, the $f Charon will dock with it and jump back to the Galatea.  We must capture Arjuna 1.  We cannot allow it to be destroyed.  To this end, we've equipped your craft with an advanced disruptor cannon.  Use it to take out its engines."

2471, "Since this station is so poorly defended, we are sending only Alpha and Beta to attack.  Alpha will cover Beta until the Shakti has been destroyed.  Then Alpha will attempt to disable Arjuna 1."

2472, "If Alpha fails to disable Arjuna 1, Delta wing will be available.  As Delta is currently guarding the $f Bastion, we will only send them in if it is imperative.  However, we believe you can do it without their help."

2473, "Because we are custom outfitting your ship, you will not be able to customize your loadout.  You have your orders.  Dismissed."

2474, "Great work Alpha 1.  We've destroyed a Shivan repair depot, and managed to get ahold of an intact Shivan fighter.  Our technicians are currently working on reverse engineering it."

2475, "For your excellent piloting abilities, the GTA has decided to award you the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Congratulations."

2476, "Your failure to destroy the Shakti has crippled our chances of holding the Deneb sector.  Such critical failures cannot be tolerated."

2477, "Your best bet in destroying the Shakti is your Beta wing bombers.  If you can keep the fighters off their backs for long enough for them to get off their Tsunami bombs, the Shakti is doomed.  However, even if you lose the bombers, you can still destroy the Shakti yourself.  Try taking out its weapons systems first, and then its turrets.  If worse comes to worst, you can call in Delta to assist you."

2478, "Good work destroying the Shakti.  Delta wing was successful in capturing the Dragon-class fighter.  However, due to Delta's absence, the Bastion took quite a beating near Deneb III.  She survived, but is in need of repairs.  It is unfortunate that you needed their help to disable a single Shivan fighter."

2479, "Disabling a Dragon is no easy task, but you have been equipped with the proper tools to do it.  Arjuna 1's power supply is low, and it cannot regenerate its shields.  Concentrate first on eliminating its shielding, and then focus on trying to get off any hits you can with the Advanced Disruptor.  Patience is the key."

2480, "You were specifically ordered not to destroy Arjuna 1.  Yet it was destroyed.  Such insubordination cannot be tolerated.  While we regret having to do so, we are grounding you for the next three months."

2481, "Do not destroy Arjuna 1.  While using the Prometheus to weaken its shields is useful, make sure you are only using the Advanced Disruptor once the Dragon's shields are down.  Do not use your missiles on it either."

$b Our $b Orders

We have now entered the Deneb system.  After your investigation of the Lucifer at Antares, Terran Command has deduced that the Shivans will be attempting a multiple pronged attack on Vasuda Prime coming from Deneb and Antares.

The Intrepid and the Minnow will be in charge of protecting the Antares-Vasuda Prime node, while the Galatea and the Bastion will be guarding Deneb."

2504, "$b The $b Shivan $b Attack

We expect the main force of the Shivan attack will come through Antares, led by the Lucifer.  A smaller secondary force, led by the Demon-class destroyer Eva, will come through Deneb.  The Shivans already control the Vega-Deneb Jump Node, so our defense will have to be at the Deneb-Vasuda Prime Jump Node.

Finding and destroying the Eva destroyer is our top priority."

2505, "$b The $b Captured $b Shivan $b Dragon

As you know, we captured a Shivan Dragon-class fighter in Beta Aquilae.  Our technicians have retro-fitted this alien fighter with Terran instrumentation and gotten it into working condition.

However, there are a few flaws with our redesign.  We could not get the Shivan weaponry to operate, so this fighter has been equipped with Terran weaponry.  We also could not properly operate the lateral thrusters or afterburners, so the ship's maneuverability is limited.

We also have had some difficulty with the Shivan engine systems.  In test runs, the Dragon broke down for short periods of time.  We are looking into this problem as we speak.

The capture of this Shivan fighter will bring great strides in fighter technology to the Alliance."

2506, "In this mission we will be using the captured Shivan Dragon-class fighter on a scouting mission in the Deneb system."

2507, "The Shivans seem to be bringing in a large number of vessels into the Deneb system through the Vega jump node.  We believe this is in preparation for a preliminary assault on Vasuda Prime."

2508, "Because the Shivans have tight control over the Vega-Deneb jump node, we cannot send in a Terran scout.  By flying the Shivan Dragon,  we believe you will be able to slip in undetected."

2509, "There are four Shivan fighters in the area, maintaining tight patrol.  If you come into close range with these fighters, they will certainly scan your ship, detect your presence, and open fire.  Avoid contact with any of the Arjuna fighters."

2510, "Arjuna seems to be maintaining consistent patterns in their patrol."

2511, "On arrival, observe their flight pattern and plan your course to avoid contact."

2512, "In the event that you are engaged by Arjuna wing, return to the Galatea immediately."

2513, "Your primary objective is to conduct a close scan of all ships that pass through the Vega-Deneb Jump Node.  This includes warships, freighters, and transports.  Try to determine the contents of any cargo containers in the area, as well."

2514, "We have reason to believe that a Shivan Demon-class destroyer, the $h Eva, will be passing through this area.  If it does, it is imperative that you scan it.  Remember that your fighter is only partially functional, and its flight systems will behave unpredictably.  Be careful.  Command out."

2515, "You failed to scan enough ships for Intelligence to analyze the Shivan forces effectively.  With the Lucifer class destroyer in the area, we are in grave danger.  Your failure to collect the needed data will have dire consequences."

2516, "Scanning the warships means getting close enough to all the cruisers and capital ships to fully scan them.  The cruisers should be easy, you can simply wait for them to come to you while you are avoiding Arjuna.  Eva leaves pretty quick, so you have to make sure you scan it as fast as possible."

2517, "You were unable to stay in the area long enough to get a clear reading on the Shivan attack force.  This failure will cost us dearly."

2518, "Make sure you wait for orders before you return to base.  Only after Terran Command is sure that all ships are accounted for will you be ready to leave.  If you are being detected by Arjuna wing, make your best effort to avoid them.  Once the warships start coming in, make quick runs to scan them and then get back out of Arjuna's range."

2519, "Pilot, you bring us terrible news.  If both the Eva and the Lucifer are here in Deneb, it will be extremely difficult to stop the Shivan attack.  Still, you did an excellent job scanning the Shivan warships.  Well done."

2520, "It is unfortunate you were unable to get readings on the Shivan freighters and transports.  It would have been useful to know what supplies the Shivans were bringing into the area."

2521, "Inspecting the freighters and transports takes a little bit of cunning.  You have to be very careful to avoid the Arjuna ships, while you scan the ships as fast as possible.  The best chance of scanning the freighters is while they are docking.  The transports you should get behind and match speed.  And always use your hotkeys to monitor Arjuna's position."

2522, "The fact that you were also able to scan the Shivan supply ships is truly outstanding.  Your courage and piloting skills are to be commended.

However, the news is bad.  The Shivans have enough supplies in those ships to sustain a lengthy assault on Vasuda Prime.  We believe their attack force will consist of at least eight full squadrons of fighters, both Genma cruisers, the Eva, and the Lucifer.  Things do not look good."

2523, "The cargo you identified contains parts for Shivan fighters.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans will set up a base in the Deneb sector, near Vasuda Prime.  This information will be invaluable in planning our counterstrike.

For your diligence in reconnaissance missions, we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

2562, "If you were playing this through a campaign, you would never see this.  It would take you straight into the next mission."

2563, "You failed to destroy the Eva.  We cannot hope to defend this system against two Shivan capital ships.  We will now be retreating to Vasuda Prime, where we must make a stand."

2564, "First, get rid of the Dragons by ordering your wingmen.  Your first task should be taking out the weapons system on the Eva.

2578, "Good job destroying the Eva."

2579, "The Galatea has been destroyed.  Many lives, many friends are gone.  Everyone in the Terran Alliance feel this loss deeply.

Yet, greater is the tragedy of the Vasudans.  There is nothing between the Shivan fleet and Vasuda Prime.  Soon their homeworld will be gone.

Our fighters fought bravely to preserve the Galatea, but there was nothing to be done.  The Lucifer was too powerful."

2580, "The Galatea has been destroyed.  Not by the hand of a cruiser or a destroyer.  But by a bomber.  This is truly a sad day for the Alliance.  If a squadron of bombers can destroy one of our flagships, how can we defeat the Lucifer?"

2581, "Protect the Galatea from the bombers at all costs.  Attack the Nephilims before worrying about the Manticores.  Shooting down the Nephilim's bombs will preserve the Galatea even longer.  If you managed to save some Synaptic bombs from the Eva attack, use them now."

2582, "You fled the most important battle of your career.  The Galatea has been lost and the people of Vasuda Prime are doomed.

Such cowardice is unconscionable.  You are permanently grounded."

2583, "At least make an attempt to save the Galatea!"

2584, "Many lives were saved by the Hermes escape pods.  For that we are thankful.  But we mourn the loss of Admiral Wolf.  He was a great commander and he died with the ship he loved.

This is Admiral Shima.  I'll be delivering your command briefs while you're onboard the GTD Bastion.  I extend a welcome to all pilots formerly stationed on the Galatea.  I wish your reassignments could have come under better circumstances.

The loss of the Galatea is a great blow to all of us.  We've lost many friends and loved ones.  We've also lost many great pilots.  We will need to double our efforts if we plan on stopping the Shivan fleet."

This brings me to the reason for this briefing.  As some of you may have already heard, shortly after the destruction of the Galatea at nineteen-hundred last night, we received word that the Shivan Lucifer made the jump to Vasuda Prime.  The Lucifer fleet bombarded Vasuda Prime from orbit for thirteen hours straight."

2602, "$b Aftermath $b of $b Vasuda $b Attack

Most escaping transport ships were destroyed.  All major Vasudan cities were leveled, and most of the landmass was rendered uninhabitable.  All of our attacks launched from the nearby installations were defeated.

We have lost contact with all Terran ships in the area, but it appears that the Shivan fleet has now moved on.  It's estimated that four billion innocent Vasudans lost their lives in the attack.

Terran Command is preparing to help evacuate all survivors to other habitable worlds in the area."

2603, "$b Our $b Orders

What we need to concentrate on now is keeping the Lucifer fleet from making further moves towards Earth.  We've been put on standby status and ordered to assist in all evacuation operations in Vasuda Prime and the surrounding systems.

2650, "After you have completed these tasks, stand by for further orders.  Good luck, Alpha 1."

2651, "You were ordered to stay in the area until you received further orders.  Yet you jumped out and the mission is a failure.  You are hereby grounded.  Dismissed."

2652, "Stay in the area and await further orders.  If you can't beat the Zenith, try to first eliminate all Dragons in the area, then go straight for the Zenith's comms.  Once the comms are out, target the weapons system and then allow your bombers to finish him off."

2659, "In a last ditch effort to stave off the Shivan attack, Terran Command pursues all the leads that it has.  One such lead takes the player and his squadron deep into conquered Vasudan territory in order to recover an ancient artifact.  And while the preliminaries are complete, the chances of this operation going off without a hitch are all but... nil."

2660, "As you already know, we are sending scientists to the Altair system to investigate records found on Altair IV.  Command hopes they will aid us in our war with the Shivans.

The Rosetta is currently carrying the scientists.  It will rendezvous with two transports, Omega 1 and Omega 2.  All three ships should be arriving within a few minutes.

Omega wing will dock with the Rosetta as soon as they arrive.  Oversee this personnel transfer, then escort Omega 1 and Omega 2 to the jump node."

2661, "Forget Rosetta.  Getting those two transports out alive is far more important.  You have to take out those heavy attack Basilisks as fast as possible, before they launch their streams of swarm missiles."

2667, "We have successfully extracted the records from Altair IV.  They have been partially deciphered and are being moved back to Terran Space.  Omega transports will once again be handling the movement of the scientists and the records."

2668, "We have successfully extracted the records from Altair IV.  They have been partially deciphered and are being moved back to Terran Space.  Omega will once again be handling the movement of the scientists and the records."

2669, "If worse comes to worst, let Omega 2 die, and go straight for the Leo bombers.  Once you've destroyed the first wave of Leos, you can simply order everyone to engage fighters, and you should have little trouble escorting Omega 1 to the jump node."

2670, "If you are having trouble keeping both transports alive, keep this in mind:  The Leo squadron of bombers has only 4 bombers, and no reinforcements.  Destroy them as quickly as possible, and you are free to worry about Omega 2.  If you can't destroy the Typhon, at least try to disable it with disruptor missiles while Omega 2 flies by."

$b The $b Lucifer

The Shivans have finally determined the location of the Sol system.  The Lucifer has moved into position here in Sirius for the subspace jump to Delta Serpentis.

From Delta Serpentis, she will certainly  make the jump to Sol to destroy our homeworld."

2674, "$b New $b Information

From the records you retrieved in Altair, we have discovered the means to destroy the Lucifer.  As you know, our shield systems do not work in subspace.  The same holds true for the Lucifer.  More importantly, the records contain the information to enable us to track a capital ship into and inside subspace.

If we can track the Lucifer into subspace, we believe a small strike force may be sufficient to destroy it."

2675, "$b Our $b Orders

We have been assigned the task of destroying the Lucifer before she reaches Sol.  The Bastion is currently en route to intercept the Lucifer at the Sirius-Delta Serpentis subspace node.

The Bastion will attempt to provide close cover, while Ursa bombers deliver a payload of Harbingers.  We believe that without the shielding system it's relied on so heavily, the Lucifer will be vulnerable.

Keep in mind that this is a time critical operation.  If we do not enter subspace soon after the Lucifer, we cannot launch our attack."

2676, "$b Destroying $b the $b Lucifer

From your earlier scans of the Lucifer in the Deneb system, we have determined that it is powered by five primary reactors.  These reactors are spread out across the Lucifer.

If all five reactors are destroyed in a short period of time, the Lucifer won't have a chance of surviving."

2677, "We don't have much time.  Report for mission briefings immediately."

2678, "We have few chances to stop the $h Lucifer.  It is heading to the Sol system but we have an opportunity to head them off at Sirius."

2679, "If you encounter the Lucifer in Sirius, hold it off until the rest of the fleet can catch up with you."

2680, "The Bastion was severely damaged in this battle.  More of the burden of destroying the Lucifer will shift to the bombers.  The Bastion will be of limited assistance.

We are now proceeding to the Delta Serpentis system."

2681, "Try to destroy all bombers before they reach the Bastion."

2682, "The GTD Bastion is in prime condition to assault the Lucifer.  We are proceeding to Delta Serpentis now."

2683, "For your outstanding defense of the GTD Bastion, you are awarded the Military Defense Medal."

2684, "The Bastion has been destroyed.  There is little hope of stopping the Lucifer at this point.  This is the saddest of days for the Alliance.  The Lucifer is expected to reach Earth in 40 hours."

2685, "Always kill the bombers first.  Try shooting down their bombs.  You cannot let the Bastion die at this stage of the war."

2686, "The Bastion made the jump to Delta Serpentis and you didn't you follow her?  She was destroyed shortly after her arrival.  We have no way of stopping the Lucifer.  This is certainly the end of the Alliance.  The Lucifer is expected to reach Earth in 40 hours."

2703, "Your task will be to provide cover for the Bastion so that it can quickly converge on the Lucifer.

That destroyer must be stopped at all costs.  Failure is absolutely not an option here, pilots.  Good luck."

2704, "Why you chose to leave the battle area is a complete mystery.  If any historians survive the destruction of Earth, they will surely wonder what went through your mind.

2786, "* GTD Krios
* Vega System
* 4/15/35

Welcome to the GTI

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.

You will lead Alpha wing of the 91st Phantoms.  As a pilot for the GTI, your missions will involve highly sensitive combat and containment operations.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

2787, "GTI Command Structure

The primary objective of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTA.  GTI is divided into three branches, each with its own fleet and each focusing on specific areas of intelligence.

Special Operations, headed by the GTD Krios, specializes in strategic assault and containment.  Our missions involve high-priority objectives in situations too sensitive, dangerous, or volatile for standard GTA forces.

Intelligence, led by the GTD Soyakaze, specializes in infiltration and espionage.  Intel primarily conducts reconnaissance and surgical strikes, and its missions are planned to provide minimal combat exposure."

2788, "GTI Command Structure (continued)

Research and Development, commanded by the GTD Repulse, specializes in the development of cutting-edge technologies.  R&D's missions involve the deployment and field-testing of advanced weapons and warship prototypes.  As an officer of the GTI, you will have access to these technologies before they become available to GTA pilots.

Normally, the three branches conduct joint operations in concert with one another, directed by a single command fleet.  Unfortunately, the loss of the GTD Legion in the Battle of Deneb earlier this year has forced us to decentralize our operations somewhat.  We will be taking our orders directly from GTA High Command."

2789, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.  The cataclysm seems to have also closed the phasing nodes to Deneb and Beta Aquilae via some sort of chain reaction.  We currently have no way to access the Sol system via subspace.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth, an interim GTA command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

2790, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVE has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.

Preserving the fragile peace treaty is of the utmost importance.  Both the Terran-Vasudan war and the Shivan war have taken a heavy toll on our fleets, so our species must work together if we are to have any hope of defeating the Shivan threat.  As an officer of the GTI, it is your responsibility to conduct yourself in a manner worthy of your station, both in battle and in your personal interaction with Vasudan colleagues.  Should tensions escalate out of control, Special Operations will brief you on the appropriate method for containing the situation."

2791, "New Technology: Leech Cannon

You are being issued the new Leech Cannon prototype.  The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the gun to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required: just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

2792, "At approximately 1530 hours, $f Terran and $f Vasudan fighters repelled a Shivan attack against $f Outpost $f Fermi, one of our primary communication terminals in $b Vega.  During the skirmish, Terran pilots fired on our Vasudan allies with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the $f PVE learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the $h Shivans will soon collapse."

2793, "Your objective will be to sanitize the area to prevent news of this incident from spreading beyond our secure zone.  Destroy everything but the $f GTI communications terminal.  The loss of innocent lives is regrettable but necessary to preserve the $f Terran-Vasudan $f alliance and defeat the $h Shivans.  You must not fail."

2794, "We have a window of five minutes during which we must complete this operation.  Staying any longer risks detection by $f GTA or $f PVE forces.  Get in, do your job, and get out.  Good luck."

2795, "Well done, pilot.  You executed a clean sweep of the area and contained a volatile incident.  Vasudan Command remains unaware of these events and the peace treaty remains intact."

2796, "For demonstrating a strong sense of duty and a commitment to preserving the Terran-Vasudan alliance at any cost, you are awarded the Commendation Medal."

2797, "Unfortunately, your squadron destroyed the GTI communications terminal in your haste to prevent the PVT Aries from using it.  While the terminal was not as important as the success of today's mission, it still represents a significant GTI asset that must now be replaced.

This incident will be noted in your record.  I suggest you avoid such losses in the future."

2798, "Don't destroy the terminal."

2799, "You failed to eliminate the PVT Aries before it communicated our objectives to Vasudan forces.  The Vasudans view this incident as an outright betrayal of the Terran-Vasudan alliance and have threatened to withdraw from the peace treaty.  Terran Command has disavowed the entire Special Operations branch of GTI and is struggling to avoid outright war.  You and your squadron will pay for your incompetence."

2800, "Destroy the transport Aries before it can use the communications terminal to send a message, preferably before it docks with the terminal in the first place.  Don't forget to use your wingmen."

2801, "You allowed the PVT Pisces to escape and notify Vasudan forces of today's events.  This incident has jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans and threatens to plunge the alliance into outright war.  Terran Command has disavowed all support of our operations.  You and your squadron will pay for your incompetence."

2802, "Be aware of the positions of all ships in the area.  You cannot afford to let any escape.  Don't forget to use your wingmen."

2803, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  Although you completed your objectives within your five-minute window, you failed to depart the engagement zone before being detected.  You have compromised our secrecy, and the GTA may now have sufficient evidence to reconstruct the original incident.  You are grounded permanently."

2804, "Return to base within your five-minute window."

2805, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  By exposing this mission you have jeopardized our treaty with the Vasudans and caused the GTA to disavow support of our operations.  You are grounded permanently."

2806, "Complete your mission within your five-minute window."

2807, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot.  Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the GTA's objectives in this theatre.  Desertion is grounds for a court martial, and you are confined to quarters pending your preliminary hearing.  Until a military court decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran Alliance."

2856, "Good work, pilots.  Keep an eye out for enemy ships.  The Pinnacle's fighters will arrive in a few minutes."

2857, "So, what kind of research are you doing here, Chensit?"

2858, "That is classified information, Beta 3."

2859, "Oh, come on.  Just a little hint.  What's in those cargo containers?  Weapons?  New subspace drives?  Shivan technology?"

2860, "Give it a rest, Beta.  You know the spooks never tell anyone anything."

2861, "All will be revealed in due time, pilot.  This area of space should prove most fruitful to our scientific endeavors.  We look forward to sharing our findings with you when our scientists on the Pinnacle complete their research."

2867, "They haven't been the same since we took out the Lucifer.  Like they've lost the will to fight, or something.  Not that I'm complaining, of course."

2868, "We're getting hammered here!  Launching escape pods!  Pilots, protect them!"

2869, "The Shivans are swarming us!  We're launching the escape pods.  Pilots, protect them!"

2870, "We've lost the Einstein!"

2871, "Now tracking the Einstein's escape pods.  Alpha and Beta, stand by for further orders."

2872, "Pilots, your new objective is to recover the escape pods.  We will deploy reinforcements to protect the Vasudan convoy.  Transmitting jump coordinates now."

2873, "Protect the Einstein's escape pods until they can be recovered."

2874, "We have tracked the Einstein's escape pods to a remote location within the Deneb system.  As you know, Hermes-class escape pods are equipped with stripped-down subspace drives that can only be used once, after which they must be replaced.  This necessitates the deployment of a retrieval ship that can accommodate the pods in its hangar bay.

The ferocity of the Shivan attack left the escape pods with little time to properly calculate jump coordinates, forcing them to jump to the first available destination.  Although they are in no immediate danger, it will be some time before allied forces can be deployed to assist.  Your wings have been assigned to safeguard the pods until they can be retrieved.

The strength of Shivan forces in this sector is unknown.  We do not believe they will concern themselves with the escape pods, but the arrival of two fighter wings will probably draw their attention.  Destroy any Shivan vessel that interferes with your mission objectives."

2875, "Good work, pilots.  You successfully ensured the recovery of both escape pods, despite the confusion and unexpected outcome.  The personnel on board the pod we retrieved are currently being debriefed and treated for the injuries they sustained during the battle.

Command has yet to respond to our inquiries regarding the Repulse's presence in the Krios's theater of operations, so for the time being Admiral Scott is treating this incident as a security breach.  You will be updated as we receive further information.

Unfortunately, this is not the only blemish on the GTI's record today.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2876, "It seems that the Shivan presence in this system is greater than we had initially assumed.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2877, "Be glad that you were not there, pilots.  The Shivans launched a savage attack that wiped out not only your reinforcements but the entire Vasudan convoy as well.  When the Pinnacle's fighters arrived, they found only a few damaged cargo containers among the debris.  These containers were recovered intact, but irreplaceable materials and research were lost aboard the ships and cargo that were destroyed.

Admiral Scott has issued a formal apology to Vasudan Intelligence for our failure to protect the convoy.  Although the Vasudans are justifiably upset over this incident, they have fortunately chosen not to hold it against us.  They have responded that the Shivan threat is too great to risk jeopardizing the alliance over such matters.  Once the Shivans have been neutralized, our species will be able to more effectively focus our attentions on research and recovery."

2878, "Follow your orders, but stay alert.  Things may not be as they seem."

2879, "Unfortunately, Command does not share the Vasudans' optimism on the outcome of today's events.  GTI has launched a formal inquiry into this incident, and you have been grounded for the duration of the investigation."

2880, "Keep an eye on your radar display so that you can break off and engage the Shivans as soon as they arrive.  Brahma wing poses the greatest threat to the survival of the escape pods."

2881, "Destroy Kali"

2882, "Defend the escape pods until they can be retrieved"

2883, "Defend the Repulse and the Krios"

2884, "Okay, I'm reading the escape pods at 2500 meters.  Moving to escort formation."

2885, "Looks like the Shivans didn't follow them here.  That's a good sign."

2886, "Einstein escape pods, this is Beta 1 of the 91st Phantoms, GTD Krios.  We have orders to protect your craft.  Please acknowledge."

2887, "Acknowledged, Beta, and standing by.  We appreciate your help."

2888, "I've transmitted our coordinates to the Krios.  It'll be awhile before they get here, so we'll have to sit tight for a bit."

2889, "Great.  I just hope that convoy will be all right while we're away.  Forty crew for a dozen freighters with cargo is not my idea of a fair trade."

2890, "I wouldn't worry.  That convoy seemed pretty well protected -- it'd take a really large or a really coordinated attack to punch through that turret screen.  Besides, Command said reinforcements were on their way."

2891, "Looks like the Shivans found us.  Break and attack!"

2892, "We've lost the escape pods!"

2893, "Return to base, everybody.  There's nothing else we can do here."

2894, "This is the GTD Repulse.  We have orders to recover the escape pods."

2895, "Looks like the Repulse got the Shivans' attention.  They're no longer targeting the pods."

2896, "Shivan bombers inbound!  Don't let them get near the Repulse!"

2897, "More bombers arriving!  They're targeting the Krios!"

2898, "Iota and Kappa wings returning to base.  The operation was a complete success."

2899, "Acknowledged, pilot.  Assist Alpha and Beta for now.  Once the Einstein's survivors are on board, secure the area."

2900, "Understood, sir."

2901, "What's with those new fighters?  I can't target any of them."

2902, "Must be some new R&D prototype.  I didn't know they had stealth technology.  They always get first shot on all the cool stuff."

2903, "Whoops -- I can target Iota and Kappa now.  Those stealth fighters must still have a few bugs left in them."

2904, "GTD Krios now on station.  Commencing pod retrieval."

2905, "Wait a minute, who's supposed to be picking us up?"

2906, "Stand by -- we've got a bit of a situation here.  Pilots, we're launching additional fighters to assist you.  Keep the Shivans away from the pods."

2907, "All hostiles have been neutralized.  Excellent work, pilots."

2908, "Now to the matter at hand.  Admiral Glaive, what are you doing in this sector?  Isn't the Repulse currently assigned to Antares?"

2909, "I might ask you the same question, Admiral Scott.  We were ordered to proceed directly to these coordinates to retrieve a set of escape pods."

2910, "While your assistance is appreciated, sir, that does not give you the right to interfere with our mission.  Both of the escape--"

2911, "We are not here to provide assistance, Admiral, nor are we interfering.  We are here to retrieve the pods.  Command has ordered us to ensure their safe and immediate transportation to Beta Aquilae.  Your involvement is no longer required."

2912, "We've received no notification of these orders."

2913, "Nevertheless, the orders stand.  You will transfer the second escape pod from your hangar bay to ours immediately."

2914, "With all due respect, Admiral Glaive, I take orders from GTA High Command only.  I will not transfer this pod to the Repulse or anywhere else without their express authorization."

2915, "Very well.  See that you contact them immediately to resolve this matter.  In the meantime, we have business elsewhere.  GTD Repulse out."

2916, "Escort Iota through an asteroid field to a secret GTI rendezvous."

2917, "$f Intelligence has requested the help of our squadron to escort a convoy to a secret cargo transfer.  The convoy consists of three ships: the $f GTC $f Adamant and two freighters with cargo.  All three carry important supplies and research.  To avoid detection, the rendezvous point is located within a dense asteroid field."

2918, "Sentry guns have been placed at the destination, but the convoy will still require protection until it reaches the safe zone.  $f Alpha and $f Beta wings will destroy any asteroids in its path.  When the convoy has reached the safe zone, return to base."

2919, "Intelligence suspects that Shivan remnants may be using the asteroid field as a staging area.  If any $h Shivans threaten the convoy, destroy them immediately."

2920, "Good work, pilots.  The entire convoy made it to the safe zone.  The research on board those ships will greatly help us in our fight against the Shivans.  You are to be commended for your diligence in achieving your objectives despite the hazardous environment."

2921, "The Adamant and one of the freighters made it to the safe zone.  Unfortunately, the other freighter was destroyed.  This ship carried important supplies and research, and now we'll just have to make do with what we've got.

Considering the hazards of the location, your performance was adequate.  However, I remind you that officers of the GTI are held to a higher standard than those of the GTA.  We expect better performance in the future."

2922, "Don't get distracted by the Shivans.  Your first priority is to protect the convoy against the asteroids, so stick close to them."

2923, "The Shivan bomber class you encountered has been designated Seraphim.  Your scans will be helpful in determining its capabilities.  Our scientists will present the results of the data analysis shortly."

2924, "This mission was a failure.  Because of damage from asteroids and Shivan attacks, both freighters were destroyed.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future.

Intelligence is very displeased, pilots.  Admiral Tess has asked that you be transferred back to the GTD Intrepid, and I have no choice but to comply.  Your transport ships out at 1330 hours tomorrow."

2925, "It can be hard to keep up with all the fighters, bombers, and other hazards in the area, but try to first take out the asteroids.  These cause the most damage to the convoy and are your first priority."

2926, "The GTC Adamant was destroyed before it could make it to the safe zone.  Thousands of lives were lost due to your poor performance."

2927, "The GTC Adamant and one of the freighters were destroyed before they could make it to the safe zone.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future."

2928, "The entire convoy was destroyed before it could make it to the safe zone.  We lost important supplies and research that would have greatly aided us in the future."

2929, "Without the materials and personnel aboard the Adamant, GTI will be forced to postpone several key projects.  Admiral Tess has demanded a formal inquiry.

News From the Front

GTA High Command is pleased to report a major victory in our war against the Shivans.  A combined Terran-Vasudan task force crushed a massive buildup of Shivan forces in Antares, destroying the SD Demiurge and a large number of supporting cruisers and cargo depots.  With the removal of this nexus of activity, the Shivan armada has been fragmented into numerous smaller secondary fleets scattered throughout known space.  Victory over the Shivans, though far from imminent, appears to be in sight.

Both the GTA and the PVE are moving quickly to secure their positions and press the advantage.  The GTD Minnow has been deployed to Beta Cygni and Betelgeuse, while the PVD Hope is en route to Vasuda and Alpha Centauri.  The Krios, however, is returning to Antares to monitor Shivan behavior and investigate several pirate factions that have cropped up in the aftermath of the Shivan defeat."

2951, "The Deneb Incident

Terran Command has informed us that the escape pod recovery mix-up in Deneb was due to a breakdown in communications.  Misunderstandings and bureaucratic errors such as these have unfortunately plagued the GTI command structure ever since the loss of the GTD Legion several months ago.  Both the Repulse and the Krios were accidentally assigned to the same operation, and the Repulse arrived first.  The first escape pod landed in the Repulse's hangar bay, while the confused personnel on the second pod landed in the Krios.

After the Krios received confirmation of the Repulse's orders, the escape pod and its occupants were transferred to Beta Aquilae.  Terran Command has classified all official records pertaining to their proceedings on this subject."

2952, "The Einstein

In the absence of further information, the Krios is continuing to investigate the Einstein's appearance in the Deneb system.  According to service logs, the Einstein was reported destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128.  The Einstein had entered the system on a routine geological survey mission three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Deneb during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

2953, "The Einstein (continued)

Before its alleged destruction at Ross 128, the Einstein was under the command of Captain Ezra Tycho, a high-ranking GTI officer.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.

The appearance of the Einstein in such a highly secure region of space is troubling.  Analysis of the ship's flight pattern indicates that it was performing a high-level scan of the area in and around the Deneb asteroid belt.  The Einstein would be in an ideal position to observe and record the activities of all Vasudan research convoys in the area.

The purpose behind these scans, as well as any data the Einstein gathered, remain unknown.  Our brief interrogations of the Einstein's survivors yielded little useful information on this subject, as most of the command crew were aboard the escape pod retrieved by the Repulse."

2954, "New Shivan Technology: SB Seraphim

Recent engagements with Shivan forces have revealed the existence of a new class of bomber, which we have designated Seraphim.  The Seraphim appears to be similar to the Nephilim in most respects, except that it boasts an additional four primary hardpoints and its armament capacity is approximately 50% greater.  Like the Nephilim, the Seraphim is a formidable foe.  Pilots are advised to carry a heavy shield-damaging weapon, such as the Banshee, in theaters where these bombers are expected.

We are unsure as to why the Shivans waited until now to introduce the Seraphim.  Its deployment could have shifted the balance in a number of close engagements during the height of the Great War.  Now, however, the Shivans appear to lack the initiative to use it effectively."

2955, "New Technology: GTF Loki

Research and Development has completed field testing of its latest stealth fighter prototype, the GTF Loki.  Featuring high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability, the Loki is designed primarily as a reconnaissance fighter.  Its shielded reactor chamber and compact hull give it a low sensor profile, enabling it to elude detection by enemy forces.  Pursuant to regulations, the Loki's on-board IFF transponder will emit an encrypted signal to allow targeting by designated friendly units.

At this time, the Loki is restricted to GTI pilots only.  No pilot in the standard GTA fighter corps is to be authorized to fly the Loki until further notice."

2956, "Approximately one hour ago, pirate raiders launched an attack on the $f Talus $f Particle $f Accelerator complex in Antares.  This facility houses top secret GTI weapons research laboratories and is of the utmost strategic importance to the war effort."

2957, "Some of the station's research modules, already weakened by previous Shivan attacks, breached containment during the engagement, causing a massive explosion that crippled the station and destroyed virtually every ship in the immediate area, including the pirate attack force and the facility's defensive perimeter."

2958, "The only craft that remain are a crippled Leviathan-class cruiser, the $f GTC $f Leto, and eight cargo containers containing critical weapons research.  This information is extremely sensitive and must be recovered immediately."

2959, "Since the security of this sector has been severely compromised, GTI forces will recover the materials to a safe location.  The station will evacuate all personnel until repairs can be completed at a later date.  Your assignment is to ensure that this operation proceeds smoothly."

2960, "Due to the loss of the station's defenses, control of this area is extremely tenuous.  We expect the pirates to return and possibly attempt to seize the weapon prototypes during their removal.  You must prevent this at all costs."

2961, "Keep the area secure until reinforcements arrive.  A repair transport will attempt to bring the Leto's systems online to help with your defense, but it may be some time before this can be accomplished.  Command will deploy additional fighters as the need arises."

2962, "Excellent work, pilots.  The weapon prototypes were successfully recovered with all records intact.  This achievement will prove invaluable to the war effort."

2963, "Good work, pilots.  Enough warhead material was recovered to allow us to reconstruct our previous research.  The GTI should be able to make up the lost ground in a matter of weeks."

2964, "You failed to ensure the recovery of sufficient research for us to reconstruct our weapons program.  Without those materials and prototypes, our capacity to wage war against the Shivans has been compromised."

2965, "Forget everything but the freighters and cargo.  Protect them at all costs."

2966, "This mission was a disaster.  Because of your carelessness, the GTI's most sensitive weapons research is now in the hands of pirates.  This failure will cost us dearly.  You are relieved until further notice."

2967, "Scan the Kappas as soon as possible.  Your wingmen will help you out when they know who to shoot."

2968, "You also helped to rescue the facility's complement of scientists.  Every life saved is critical to the war effort.  You are to be commended for your skill in completing your objectives."

2969, "We are pleased that the GTC Leto survived this engagement.  With a few days' repair in drydock and a new crew, she'll soon be able to return to active duty.  Great work protecting a valuable fleet asset."

3008, "A routine escort mission turns deadly when the GTI loses control of its volatile cargo."

3009, "Following the recovery of the Talus Particle Accelerator, the $b Antares system is nearly secure.  Residual pirate activity is almost nonexistent, and the Shivan presence in this system is too scattered and disorganized to present a credible threat."

3010, "With the pressure on our core systems relieved, GTI is stepping up research and development of new technologies.  Several important projects are nearing completion, and GTI has decided to move them to $b Beta $b Aquilae where their results can be more closely monitored."

3011, "In this mission, you will be tasked with guarding a GTI science convoy as it transfers its cargo to Beta Aquilae.  The convoy consists of three Faustus-class cruisers: the $f GTSC $f Moreau, the $f GTSC $f Idun, and the $f GTSC $f Ratna.  The cruisers are carrying research and prototypes for $b Project $b Eumenides, the GTI's most highly classified weapons program."

3012, "You will escort the cruisers as far as the Beta Aquilae jump node.  Upon reaching Beta Aquilae, the cruisers will be joined by a second escort and taken to a secret location."

3013, "Because of the extremely sensitive nature of this convoy, we are assigning three wings to protect it.  However, we do not believe you will encounter significant resistance.  Because of the scarcity of Shivans in this system, the remaining ships seem to be unable to coordinate their attacks effectively."

3014, "As always, GTI will be on hand to monitor your progress.  Good luck."

3015, "You were clearly ordered to maintain your escort of the Ratna, pilot.  Your dereliction of duty has cost the GTI many months of research and the invaluable technology aboard that vessel.

In the GTA, desertion is grounds for court-martial.  But officers of Galactic Terran Intelligence are held to a much higher standard, and your cowardice is inexcusable on such an important mission.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  Your superiors on the Krios will be informed that you were killed in action."

3016, "If you're in a tight spot, ask your wingmen to help you out.  Reinforcements will arrive shortly after the Abaddon jumps in."

3017, "Pilot, this failure is inexcusable!  The entire convoy was lost, and now the Shivans possess our most sensitive new technology!  You have single-handedly cost us months of research and signed our entire strategic initiative over to the Shivans.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  I assure you, it will not be pretty."

3018, "Move quickly to destroy the Shivan transports before they can dock with the Ratna.  Stay close to the Abaddon's belly, because it's only a short hop from the hangar to the cruiser."

3019, "Pilot, this failure is inexcusable!  Your incompetence has cost us months of research and set us back years in our efforts to understand the Shivans.  The GTI expects top-notch performance from its pilots, and your egregious failure on such an important mission has permanently ended your career.

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  Your superiors on the Krios will be informed that you were killed in action."

3020, "Watch the Ratna's hull integrity.  Also keep an eye on the ships attacking the freighters, since any stray shots may hit the Ratna."

3021, "Well done, pilots.  Despite fierce resistance, the GTI was able to recover the Ratna and its cargo.  Shivan strategies are difficult to predict, and we did not anticipate them sending a destroyer to capture a mere science cruiser."

3022, "The destruction of the SD Abaddon is a major blow for the Shivans.  Your performance in this operation was most impressive."

3023, "According to reports from Beta Aquilae, the GTI received sufficient research to continue Project Eumenides as originally planned.  This technology will benefit the GTA immensely in our fight against the Shivans.  Research and Development estimates that the first of these next-generation weapons, the EMP Missile, will be available for field testing within the month.

I have been informed by Command that the flight records for this mission have been classified Level Omega.  As such, I am required to notify you that divulging any information about this mission, directly or indirectly, to any persons other than those specifically authorized by Galactic Terran Intelligence, is a treasonous offense, punishable by death.

3084, "Pilots, we are launching Kappa wing to destroy the Abaddon.  Provide cover."

3085, "Kappa wing has been destroyed.  Return to base, pilots -- there's nothing more we can do here."

3086, "Command, what is a DEMON CLASS DESTROYER doing in Antares?!?"

3087, "Pilots, do NOT engage the Abaddon.  Maintain full escort of the Ratna!"

3088, "Look at that thing!  It's cradling the Ratna like a baby!"

3089, "The Ratna is out of range of the Abaddon!  Pilots, keep close to the freighter and ensure that it jumps out safely.  We'll distract the Abaddon for you."

3090, "Transmitting jump coordinates now.  All ships, return to base."

3091, "The GTI begins their offensive against the Shivans.  The first step is to attack a series of cargo convoys."

The Shivans

Vasudan forces have secured Vasuda, Deneb, and Sirius, while Terran forces are making rapid progress on the Vega and Betelgeuse fronts.  Isolated cells of activity are being crushed in Alpha Centauri, Aldebaran, and Regulus.  Inexplicably, all Shivan activity in the Capella colonies has vanished.

The bulk of the Shivan armada appears to be retreating to Ikeya and Ross 128, where they will likely make their stand and possibly attempt a counterattack.  However, GTA tacticians doubt their chances of success.  Experts have observed that the Shivans appear to be lacking ordered leadership and coordination."

3093, "Our Mission

While the remainder of the fleet is hunting down the Shivans in Terran and Vasudan space, Special Ops has been charged with softening up the fleeing armada as they attempt to regroup.  Your next series of missions will involve surgical strikes against overwhelming odds deep in Shivan territory.  Fortunately, we have some new tools to assist us."

3094, "New Technology: Shield Breaker

The new Shield Breaker is a special-issue weapon developed specifically for this campaign.  Designed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker is an electromagnetic energy disruptor, inflicting massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon such as the Prometheus will be effective against heavily shielded fighters and bombers.  The Shield Breaker has greater weapons compatibility and energy efficiency than the Banshee."

3095, "New Technology: GTB Zeus

Research and Development has completed field testing of the Zeus strike bomber.  Like the Athena, its predecessor, the Zeus offers excellent speed and maneuverability.  Additionally, more efficient design enables the Zeus to carry Tsunami space bombs in its arsenal.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against medium-sized targets."

3096, "Recent victories have forced the majority of the $h Shivan fleet to fall back to the initial systems in which they appeared, $h Ikeya and $h Ross $h 128.  Recon has located waves of heavily escorted Shivan convoys heading to Ikeya from Ribos.

Our mission here is twofold.  First, we will shut down the Shivan convoys and sever their supply lines.  Second, we will capture the cargo and analyze its contents."

3097, "Your squadron will enter the system between convoys.  You must quickly eliminate any Shivan fighters guarding the node.  Once the area is secured, our forces will set up an ambush."

3098, "Sentry guns will be dropped near the Ikeya jump node to intercept any escaping ships.  Alpha and Beta wings will destroy all Shivan freighters and transports, leaving the cargo intact.  Our own freighters will then pick up the cargo and depart."

3099, "We estimate we will be able to intercept at least three waves of transports before the Shivans are alerted to our plan.  In case of any unforeseen developments, await orders from Command.

Report to the flight deck immediately."

3100, "You allowed a significant part of the Shivan force to escape.  Although we were successful in neutralizing most of the Shivan supply line, the surviving ships will undoubtedly cause trouble for our forces later on.  Your failure will cost us lives and ships we should not have to lose."

3101, "Disabling the freighters will prevent them from escaping.  Alternatively, use Disruptor Missiles to temporarily knock out their systems."

3102, "Excellent work, pilot.  Your performance in this mission was outstanding.  Shivan supply lines to Ikeya have been cut off and we now have full control over this subspace node."

3103, "Good work, pilot.  Our containment operation was effective in neutralizing most of the Shivan supply line.  The few surviving ships are unlikely to provide significant reinforcement to the Shivan position in Ikeya.  Still, GTI prides itself on going above and beyond the call of duty, and our failure to destroy every ship mars our record somewhat."

3104, "You also destroyed all hostile targets, including several fighter wings and the Cain cruiser Maus.  You and your wingmen are to be commended for this accomplishment."

3105, "Unfortunately, not all the cargo was recovered.  Some of our recovery craft were destroyed by the Shivan cruisers.  With the Shivans being destroyed or disappearing all over Terran-Vasudan space, we must gather all the data about them we can while we still have the opportunity."

3106, "If you can take out some of the cruisers' turrets with Phoenix or Stiletto missiles, the transports should be able to jump out safely."

3107, "Unfortunately, not all the cargo was recovered.  Theta wing never arrived at the designated GTI rendezvous.  Command is officially listing them as MIA until evidence can be found to the contrary, but it is unlikely that they could have been intercepted by the Shivans.  Keep your eyes open for any unusual activity in the future."

3108, "Despite the odds, you stood and faced the Genma cruisers and assisted the Monitor and Leto in their defense of the node.  Your actions have saved many lives.  For going above and beyond the call of duty, you are awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Well done."

3109, "Despite the odds, you stood and faced the Genma cruisers and assisted the Monitor in its defense of the node.  Your actions have saved many lives.  For going above and beyond the call of duty, you are awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Well done."

3152, "Roger that, Command.  All right, Beta, keep those fighters off us."

3153, "Affirmative.  Watch out for the crossfire!"

3154, "Convoy one is down, Command.  All cargo is intact."

3166, "Shivans are attacking our recovery craft.  Protect them, pilots!"

3167, "Command, I'm reading two Lilith cruisers!  Request status update!"

3173, "The Shivan cruiser group Hellfire is on its way to reinforce the main Shivan battlegroup.  Your squadron's task: interception."

3174, "Reconnaissance has observed a Shivan cruiser group, designated $h Hellfire, en route to the $b Ikeya jump node.  If $h Hellfire reaches its destination, it will be reunited with the main Shivan fleet."

3175, "$h Hellfire consists of four cruisers, both Cain and Lilith class, with a fighter escort of ten to fifteen ships.  Normally we would send the $f Krios to reinforce the node blockade, but this information was acquired at the last minute and we don't have time for a full deployment."

3176, "Instead, your squad will intercept and destroy as much of the Shivan force as possible.  Beta and Delta will engage the cruisers.  Alpha and Gamma will defend the bomber wings and neutralize the fighter threat."

3177, "If $h Hellfire is stopped, we can expect a decisive victory in $b Ikeya.  If $h Hellfire gets through, the Shivans may be able to hold out long enough to mount an offensive.

Our forces are counting on you, pilots.  Report to the flight deck immediately."

3178, "Excellent job, pilots!  The entire Shivan battlegroup was destroyed, thanks to your squadron.  You have proven your dedication to the GTI once again."

3179, "You did well in this mission, pilot.  Though one cruiser escaped, we will destroy it when we make our assault."

3180, "If you disable any cruisers before they escape, you should be able to fulfill your objectives.  Disruptor missiles and Stilettos can be used to great effect."

3181, "You also destroyed Hellfire's fighter escort.  This will make the assault against Ikeya much easier for our bombers."

3182, "Harr!  The FS2 Volition Bravos is the scurviest ship in the known universe.  Furl yer sails, strike yer colors, and prepare to be boarded by the FreeSpace 2 team!"

3183, "Fortunately, you were able to destroy Hellfire's fighter escort.  This will help even the odds a bit."

3184, "Unfortunately, you failed to destroy Hellfire's fighter escort.  These ships will undoubtedly return to cause trouble for our forces in the upcoming invasion.  Such carelessness ill suits a GTI officer.  This incident will be noted in your record."

3185, "This mission did not go as planned.  Two Shivan cruisers managed to reinforce the fleet in Ikeya, and scans indicate they are now blockading the other side of the jump node.  They now have the high ground, and we expect heavy losses in our initial push."

3186, "Cover your bombers and they'll work on the cruisers.  Disruptor missiles can be used to temporarily shut down cruisers, buying valuable time.  Phoenix V missiles are also very effective against the turrets."

3187, "This mission was a disaster!  We dedicated four wings to this operation, and you only succeeded in destroying a single cruiser.  We do not have the resources to wage war with the Shivans much longer, and failures like these cost us ships, weapons, and lives."

3188, "Your performance in this mission was atrocious.  You realized the importance of this mission yet you failed to destroy a single cruiser.  This disgrace has permanently stained your service record."

3189, "However, we are so short-handed on pilots that we can't afford to ground you.  Instead, your squadron will consist of the first attack wave on the reinforced Shivan positions."

3190, "Beta and Delta wings are carrying Tsunami bombs with which to destroy the cruisers.  You must protect them by drawing away the fighter escort and attacking turrets when possible."

3191, "With the Ribos system secure, the way is now clear for our forces to begin the assault on Ikeya.  The Intrepid and the Hope have been deployed to Ribos to spearhead this operation.  Scouts have determined that no Shivan vessels above cruiser class remain in this area of space, so the system should be ours within a matter of days.

* 5/16/35

Ross 128

With our victory in the Ikeya system, allied forces have succeeded in eradicating the Shivan presence from almost every corner of Terran-Vasudan space.  Only one Shivan stronghold remains: the Ross 128 system, site of the first Shivan attack on our territory.

The GTA and PVE have deployed all available ships to Delta Serpentis in preparation for the invasion of Ross 128.  The assault will be led by the GTD Bastion and the PVD Pinnacle, the finest ships in the Terran and Vasudan fleets."

3212, "On the Vanguard

Intelligence believes the Shivans have enough supplies and warships in Ross 128 to mount a significant defense.  Special Ops has been tasked with doing whatever it can to reduce the amount of resistance our fleets will encounter as they scour the system.

Our operations will be divided into two phases.  In the first phase, our squadrons will perform a reconnaissance-in-force of the system to determine the optimum allied attack strategy.  In the second phase, after the invasion begins, our squadrons will conduct strategic assaults against key Shivan positions.

We will be deploying all available wings on continuous rotation, so when you leave here, report to your squadron leaders for immediate mission briefings.  The Krios itself will remain standing by in a hidden location should problems arise during the invasion."

3213, "New Technology: Cluster Bomb

Research and Development has made available two new weapons to assist our forces in the invasion.

A variant of the Synaptic Bomb, GTI's cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against groups or wings of enemy ships.  Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a field of high-intensity explosive charges, making the Cluster Bomb most effective against fighter formations and freighters.  The Cluster Bomb has a large blast radius and can destroy your fighter if detonated at close range."

3214, "New Technology: Electromagnetic Pulse Missile

The EMP Missile has just completed field testing, and R&D's scientists are conducting a final evaluation of its design.  The missile is designed to produce a large electromagnetic pulse that scrambles sensors, communications, and navigation systems, crippling all small craft caught in the blast radius.

We are expecting a shipment of the missiles from the Repulse shortly and anticipate the weapon will be available for use when you return from your next series of missions."

3215, "In preparation for the main GTA thrust into Ross 128, our squadron is being dispatched to scout out the area.  Your assignment is to scan a suspected nexus of Shivan activity near the site of the original attack on Outpost Riviera.  Because our communications network in Ross 128 was destroyed when the Shivans first attacked, you will be out of contact with Command for the duration of this mission."

3216, "Gather as much data as you can.  We do not know the extent of the Shivan presence in this sector, so be cautious.  Expect to encounter the standard complement of freighters, transports, and fighters.  Scan all warships in the area as well as any debris that you find.  If you get the opportunity, scan the cargo in the area as well."

3217, "The GTI places a high priority on this operation, pilots.  It is preferable to gather a small amount of data and return safely than to gather too much information and fail to make it out alive.  We need whatever you can give us, no matter how insignificant it may seem.  Dismissed."

3218, "You failed to gather any worthwhile data on this sortie, pilot.  Without scans of both cruisers, the GTI cannot form any reasonable theory as to what happened during your mission.  The GTA will now be at a strategic disadvantage when it begins its invasion.  Dismissed!"

3219, "Scanning both cruisers isn't hard.  Just order all your wingmen to protect you and get in and out quick.

Scanning the transport and cargo is a little more difficult.  Get the transport as soon as you arrive, then order your wingmen to destroy the freighters so you can scan the cargo in relative peace.  Scan the cruisers last -- they aren't going anywhere."

3220, "This mission was a surprise for both of us, pilot.  Thanks to your scans, we have verified that the cruisers you encountered are GTI ships, originally registered as GTC Odin and GTC Thor.  Official records, however, show that these cruisers were destroyed in two separate engagements at the beginning of the Great War.  The fact that these ships were present in a highly sensitive sector of Shivan-controlled space at the same time as your deployment is more than a little suspicious.  We can only assume that this operation was carried out by a rogue element of the GTI."

3221, "Thanks to your scan of the Shivan transport, Intelligence may soon be able to determine the motivation and intent of the rogue operation.  We are already preparing a preliminary report to deliver to Terran Command.  Excellent work."

3222, "Thanks to your scan of the Shivan cargo, Intelligence may soon be able to determine the motivation and intent of the rogue operation.  We are already preparing a preliminary report to deliver to Terran Command.  Excellent work."

3244, "The last Shivan Demon bites the dust, with a little help from the EMP Missile.  But something's not right..."

3245, "Allied forces all over the system have reported major victories in their attacks against the Shivans.  The $f GTD $f Bastion and her battlegroup have already destroyed a number of cruisers, fighter wings, and cargo depots.  The $f PVD $f Pinnacle and her battlegroup have reported similar successes.

But to completely secure Ross 128, we must decapitate the Shivan infrastructure.  Intelligence believes the source of command for the Shivans in this sector to be the $h SD $h Archon, a Demon-class destroyer.  This ship will be the target of our next operation."

3246, "The $h Archon is a hive of Shivan activity, with reconnaissance sighting several freighters, transports, cargo formations and sentry guns, and at least two Cain-class cruisers: the $h SC $h Golem and the $h SC $h Chimera.

You will lead a GTI task force into the area and eliminate all ships you encounter.  Normally you would be significantly outmatched in such an operation, but we have something special in store."

3247, "The new $b EMP $b Missile has been completed, and this mission will serve as a final evaluation.  Wings $f Iota and $f Kappa from the $b 122nd $b Crazy $b Ivans, monitored by the $f GTSC $f Giordano, will saturate the area with electromagnetic pulses prior to your deployment."

3248, "The EMP cloud will impair all sensors on Terran and Shivan craft.  The Shivans should not be able to target you, but you won't be able to target them either.  For this reason, your loadout should include dumbfire or heat-seeking missiles.  Our scientists predict the effect will last between two and five minutes."

3249, "$f Alpha, $f Beta, and $f Gamma wings will relieve the $b 122nd and inflict as much damage as possible while the EMP field is active.  Once the effect wears off and aspect lock is possible, $f Delta and $f Epsilon wings will deploy their heavy ordnance.  Command has authorized the use of $f GTB $f Ursa heavy bombers for this mission."

3250, "This is the coup de grace, pilots.  Once the $h Archon has been destroyed, the allied fleet should have no trouble isolating and eliminating the remnants of the Shivan fleet.  If you succeed here today, we will have nothing more to fear.  Good luck."

I cannot imagine what you must be thinking, pilots.  To return to your command ship after what was to have been a great victory, only to find it under attack from your fellow officers.  Though you fought valiantly, the Krios and most of her crew were lost.  They died a bitter death, betrayed by the very organization they swore to defend.

This development has grave implications for the future of the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  Terran Command has already been notified of our situation and will be updated as we debrief the survivors of the Krios.  I will address the crew of the Soyakaze tomorrow with our findings.

In recognition of your contributions to the allied victory over the Shivans, the GTA has awarded you the Medal of Honor.  Take comfort in the fact that, though your return is not as triumphant as it should be, we will never have to fear the Shivans ever again."

3310, "This is Admiral Tess of the GTD Soyakaze.

I cannot imagine what you must be thinking, pilots.  To return to your command ship after what was to have been a great victory, only to find it under attack from Terran ships.  Though you fought valiantly, the Krios and her crew were lost.  The phantom attackers have since disappeared without a trace.

This development has grave implications for the future of the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  If a rogue cell is active in our military, it has the potential to significantly destabilize our reconstruction efforts.  Terran Command has ordered a full investigation, but without the crew or flight records from the Krios, I am afraid we have little to go on."

Victory

At 0525 hours this morning, GTA High Command declared a decisive victory over the Shivans in Ross 128 and Ikeya.  The species which annihilated the Ancients, which devastated Vasuda Prime, which nearly succeeded in driving mankind to extinction, has been defeated.  Recon units have found no trace of any remaining Shivan activity.

With the Shivans gone, we should be able to start rebuilding our shattered systems and working on forging a lasting alliance with the Vasudans.  But there has been a terrible new development."

3346, "Ambush

While allied forces throughout Ross 128 engaged the Shivans, fighters and bombers launched from the GTD Repulse secretly attacked, disabled, and destroyed the Krios.  Only through the intervention of the Soyakaze were the survivors recovered.  We believe the Krios was destroyed to cover up information it had gathered about rogue activity in the Research and Development branch of GTI.

Once we had contacted GTA High Command, the Repulse and the R&D fleet immediately sprang into action, pulling out of Ross 128 and heading to Delta Serpentis.  Command has authorized all GTA units to consider these forces hostile, and to capture or destroy them at any opportunity.

Our agents have pieced together the events leading up to the Krios's destruction by analyzing the evidence salvaged from her.  A summary of the report follows."

3347, "Evidence

The Krios's interrogations of the Einstein's survivors suggest that Research and Development knew about the existence of the Shivans even before their initial appearance at Ross 128.  Several science vessels, including the Einstein, were assigned to secretly study this new species and its technology.  We believe the Einstein was deployed to Ross 128 and then reported destroyed so that the ship could continue its research operations without fear of outside supervision.

While R&D was instrumental in enabling the GTA and PVE fleets to quickly close the technological gap on the Shivans during the Great War, events strongly suggested that the Repulse and its fleet were keeping their most significant discoveries to themselves.  Based on the Einstein's appearance at the Vasudan research site in Deneb, Admiral Scott theorized that there could be an unknown number of ghost R&D ships conducting research unaccountable to the rest of the GTA.  This theory was given further support when pilots from the Krios blundered upon a secret recovery operation in Ross 128 and came under fire from rogue ships."

3348, "Betrayal

With the Krios slowly assembling evidence, the rogue elements grew in increasing danger of being exposed.  The Repulse sought to destroy this information before it reached critical mass and soon found the perfect opportunity.

With the Krios's fighter wings and support craft engaging the Shivans in Ross 128, the destroyer was left virtually undefended.  The rebels launched bombers against the Krios while sanitizing several SpecOps operations and jamming the transmissions of others under the guise of monitoring scientific data.  Only the pilots attacking the SD Archon returned early enough to witness the destruction of the Krios, and it was only because of their quick thinking that we were able to recover enough evidence to implicate Research and Development.  We have taken care to spread that information far enough that it can no longer be covered up.  The silent threat has been forced into the open."

3349, "Rebellion

We do not yet know the full extent of the insurrection, nor the rebels' motives or objectives.  Unfortunately, our maneuvers against the Shivans have left our fleets at serious risk of guerilla attacks from within.  While the GTA consolidates its forces, the Soyakaze has been tasked with gathering all the data we can about the enemy's objectives.  We cannot allow them the element of surprise.

Report for mission briefings immediately."

3350, "At ease, pilots, and welcome to the 82nd Nighthawks.  I understand you're still a little shaken up after the destruction of the $f Krios, but rest assured -- the $h R&D rebels will get what's coming to them, sooner or later.  $f Terran $f Command and the officers of the $f Soyakaze are still analyzing data regarding the $h R&D insurrection and preparing a counterattack.  You'll be fully briefed when the time comes."

3351, "A situation is developing in $b Delta $b Serpentis.  Slipping behind our rear defenses, the $h Repulse launched a surprise attack against the diplomatic installations orbiting Delta Serpentis IV.  $f Terran and $f Vasudan forces responded quickly, but by the time they arrived, the orbital annex of the Vasudan Embassy had been wiped out.

The loss of life was less than would be expected from such an attack, but our communications with the Vasudan government have been thrown into disarray.  Needless to say, the incident has not improved Terran-Vasudan relations either."

3352, "Although the $h Repulse has since gone into hiding, the GTA isn't taking any chances.  The survivors of the attack are currently being relocated to fortified positions within the Terran-Vasudan fleet.  Diplomats, officers, and supply convoys are currently en route to a secure rendezvous point within the Delta Serpentis system, where they will be joined by the $f GTC $f Challenger and the $f PVC $f Bastet."

3353, "Unfortunately, $h R&D has access to our fleet communications network, so it is quite likely that the convoys will fall under attack.  You must defend the convoys until the Challenger and Bastet arrive.  Once the cruisers have relieved you, you may return to the $f Soyakaze.

Do not fail, pilots.  Dismissed."

3354, "Your primary objective was to defend the convoys against rebel attack, and you failed.  Hundreds of innocent lives were lost due to your incompetent performance.  Worse, Terran relations with the Vasudan government may have been damaged beyond repair.

You and your wing are grounded pending a formal inquiry into these events.  As wing leader, you will be court-martialed and charged with willful negligence of duty.  Frankly, you'll be lucky to get a dishonorable discharge."

3355, "Pay particular attention to Bragi, Roskva and Buri wings.  Be careful not to get distracted by dogfighting."

3356, "Good job, Alpha.  Thanks to you, the majority of the survivors were successfully evacuated.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3357, "Your protection of the freighters ensured that the refugees were well-supplied when they arrived at their shelter.  Well done."

3358, "Excellent work, Alpha.  Through your efforts, every single ship that was in your care made it to safe havens in Delta Serpentis.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3359, "Alpha 4 exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer of the GTA, and has been disciplined accordingly.  Let me remind you that all pilots have a responsibility to adhere to the highest standards of behavior, especially in their interactions with Vasudans.

With the repositioning of the GTA and PVE fleets in Delta Serpentis, the way is clear for our forces to begin the counterattack.  The next briefing will be at 1400 hours this afternoon.  Don't be late."

3375, "You are late, Terrans.  Our vessels have already assembled themselves."

3376, "Late?  We launched as soon as we received our orders."

3377, "We expected you to be here upon our arrival.  During our rendezvous, we were vulnerable to enemy attack."

3378, "Hey, pal, give us a break.  We know less about this than you do.  We got here as quickly as we could."

3379, "Then let us be glad the rebels were not quicker."

3380, "I think we got them all.  Alpha wing, resume escort formation."

3381, "I don't see why we have to guard the Vasudan ships too.  Don't they have their own fighters?"

3382, "Most of the fleet was caught off-guard when R&D attacked.  I'm sure the Vasudan fighters are off doing something important."

3383, "Yeah, like spying on us.  If you ask me, we should never have let them into Delta Serpentis."

3384, "I didn't ask you, and shut up.  They can hear you."

3385, "I don't care if they can.  They can't do anything on their own, that's why they came running to us as soon as the Shivans attacked.  That's why they need us to guard every single one of their stupid convoys!"

3386, "You have a loud mouth, Terran.  If you knew the truth you would not say such things."

3387, "I'll say whatever I want, fish-lover.  If if weren't for us, you wouldn't have a fleet to run home to.  You couldn't even stop the Lucifer from glassing your planet!"

3388, "Pilot, that is enough!  Your behavior is risking an interspecies incident!  Focus on your mission and maintain radio silence."

3389, "Forced Hand"

3390, "The GTA conducts a surprise attack on a secret shipyard in Delta Serpentis."

3391, "The $h Research $h and $h Development branch of GTI has now staged an all-out open rebellion against the $f GTA.  Terran Command reports that all $h R&D ships are pulling out of allied operations and regrouping in $b Delta $b Serpentis and $b Beta $b Aquilae.

We suspect that the rebels are setting up rallying points throughout these systems, but they have proven quite adept at evading our efforts to track them down."

3392, "Fortunately, the $f Intelligence branch of GTI employs the most skilled reconnaissance and espionage operatives in the entire GTA.  Scouts from the $f Soyakaze have located a major rallying point in a remote corner of $b Delta $b Serpentis, guarded by none other than the $h Repulse herself.

Command has ordered us to capture the Repulse to determine the full extent of the insurrection.  The operation will proceed as follows."

3393, "A small strike force will arrive to confront the $h Repulse directly and draw its attention.  Meanwhile, $f Alpha wing will arrive on the far side of the engagement zone and attempt to slip in undetected.  The strike force will attempt to distract the Repulse long enough for you to disable and disarm it.  Transports will then arrive to board and capture the ship."

3394, "In addition to the $h Repulse, reconnaissance reports several freighters, three cruisers, and a large drydock of unknown configuration.  The drydock is unarmed and should pose no threat, but the other ships must be destroyed.  Additional units will be deployed to neutralize these threats, but you may be required to assist them once your have completed your objectives.  Vasudan forces will blockade the jump nodes to $b Beta $b Aquilae and $b Ross $b 128 to prevent any ships from escaping."

3395, "Exercise care during this mission, pilots.  The $h Repulse is commanded by $h Admiral $h Marcus $h Glaive, the highest-ranking field officer in $h R&D.  You can be sure that he will deploy his most capable forces, including his $b Loki-class stealth fighters, to defend his position.

Although our engineers are searching for a weakness in the Loki's stealth technology, their efforts have so far proven unsuccessful.  Regardless of the situation, you must do everything in your power to ensure that this mission succeeds.  The security of the GTA may depend on it."

3396, "Excellent work, pilots.  Our forces executed a clean sweep of the battle area.  Despite heavy resistance, we managed to capture the Repulse and destroy its cruiser escort.  The Vasudans report that all ships attempting to escape the system were neutralized by the blockades.

Unfortunately, we were unable to capture Admiral Glaive himself.  While you were distracted by transport Omega, a single Hermes escape pod left the Repulse's hangar and jumped to an unknown location.  Attempts to track the pod have so far proven unsuccessful.  However, Intelligence believes the interrogation of the Repulse's crew will provide us with sufficient information to plan our next move."

3397, "At present, we have determined that the Repulse was not rendezvousing at a rallying point, as we had initially assumed, but rather guarding a shipyard in the process of being evacuated.  Freighters had been moving supplies out of the area for several days, and the drydock was being rigged to self-destruct.

The drydock itself is something of an enigma.  Although it is constructed of standard Polaris modules, no designs exist for a configuration of this size and scope.  Scans indicate that the drydock was recently occupied by a large vessel, but all maintenance and repair records have been erased.

Quite what this means at this point is unknown, but Command has urged us to continue our investigation with caution."

3398, "You and your squadron destroyed the Repulse, despite specific orders to preserve it for capture.

This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  Although we have removed the rebel leadership, guerrilla forces continue to harass our ships and attack our convoys throughout Delta Serpentis and Beta Aquilae.  Tracking down these forces will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had our operation succeeded.

Your squadron is being removed from active duty until further notice.  Dismissed."

3399, "Don't destroy the Repulse.  Use Stilettos instead of Tsunamis, and pay attention to your wingmen."

3400, "You and your squadron failed to disable the Repulse before it escaped."

3401, "You and your squadron failed to intercept Omega before it could repair the Repulse."

3402, "This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  We will have to attempt the operation a second time, but the Repulse is now fully aware of our plans and will undoubtedly have called for reinforcements.  We have no choice but to attempt a direct frontal assault, one which will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had this operation succeeded the first time.

Your squadron is being removed from active duty until further notice.  Dismissed."

3411, "You're hardly in a position to be making demands, Captain.  Do you really expect us to back down against a mere two cruisers?"

3412, "We have more backup in transit, Admiral.  You can save yourself the trouble by powering down now."

3413, "Captain, be reasonable.  The fleet has been wiped out and we've lost all contact with Earth.  Fighting against us is futile."

3414, "Surrender or be destroyed.  This is your final warning."

3415, "I don't have time for this.  All fighters, engage and destroy the allied warships."

3416, "The Lokis are breaking off to engage the cruisers.  Now's your chance, Alpha.  Disable the Repulse before they notice you."

3417, "The Lokis have detected your presence!  The Repulse is charging its subspace drive -- pilots, go to FULL BURN and take out its engines before it can jump!"

3452, "Excellent work, pilot.  Despite fierce resistance, you were able to protect the Hope long enough for us to recover it to a secure location.  It will be a long time before the destroyer is ready for service again, but your efforts saved thousands of lives and a significant portion of our war materiel.

We have no conclusive data regarding the Serkr warhead deployed in this engagement.  It seems to be between 25 and 50 percent more powerful than the Tsunami.  Your efforts prevented R&D from using this weapon to its fullest capability."

3453, "You also neutralized every enemy vessel attempting to run the blockade.  Most impressive.  This will significantly impede rebel operations in Beta Aquilae."

3454, "Unfortunately, many of the rebel ships managed to run our blockade and escape to the Beta Aquilae system.  Our efforts to track them through subspace have proven ineffective."

3455, "The survivors rescued from the Aten cruisers appear to be suffering from severe shock and post-traumatic stress and are currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation.  They are lucky to be alive, and the PVE has expressed gratitude for their safe recovery."

3456, "Many of the survivors on board the Aten cruisers were killed before they could be safely recovered.  Their loss will be keenly felt."

3457, "Protect the Aten cruisers until the survivors can be extracted."

3458, "The scans from the GTSC Hinton are highly alarming.  It appears that the damage done to the blockade was inflicted by Shivan flux cannon weaponry, similar to that observed on the Lucifer superdestroyer.  Our scientists are poring over the data, and the Repulse crew is being interrogated on the matter.  Further information on the proceedings has been classified, so I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis."

3459, "The PVD Hope and her crew of over 9,000 officers and crew were lost to the fierce rebel offensive.  This tragedy is a terrible blow to the alliance.  In the aftermath of our war with the Shivans and the advent of the R&D rebellion, the loss of yet another destroyer and the resources it held puts a tremendous strain on our remaining fleets.

The loss of the Hope and the near-complete destruction of an entire Vasudan blockade force indicates the rebellion is much more powerful than we had initially assumed.  Command has ordered the Terran fleets to withdraw to Delta Serpentis, where we will attempt to consolidate our forces."

Origin of the Rebellion

With the material and information obtained from the capture of the Repulse, our counterintelligence agents have finally determined the origin and extent of the rebellion.  The discovery is deeply troubling.  Rogue activity within the GTI is not confined to the Research and Development branch, but involves officers in the highest echelon of the intelligence directorate.

Effective immediately, the GTA has terminated all support of GTI operations and declared an open state of war against the organization.  All forces loyal to the GTA, including the Soyakaze and the remnants of the Intelligence and Special Ops fleets, have been reintegrated into the main GTA battlegroup."

3518, "The GTI

Because of the technology and sensitive information within its grasp, the GTI poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the GTA, the PVE, and all allied worlds.  GTI's assets include, in addition to the ship and weapon prototypes developed by R&D, the top military scientists and strategic planners in the GTA.  They are not to be underestimated.

Against the GTI, our most effective weapon will be the numerical superiority of the combined GTA and PVE fleets.  Our actions must be swift and decisive."

3519, "New Developments

Our tactical situation will be greatly improved by the latest discovery from the Soyakaze's personnel.  Analysis of the GTF Loki has enabled our engineers to identify a design flaw in the Loki's structural composition.  This flaw renders the Loki's stealth technology effectively useless, as a simple reconfiguration of sensor parameters allows the Loki to be targeted by any of our ships.  All sensor systems in the GTA and PVE fleets have been upgraded with this new information."

3520, "Our Mission

Command has disclosed the location of the GTI's base of operations: the Jotunheim installation in the Beta Aquilae system.  The existence and location of this installation were, until now, classified at the highest level.  Our analysts believe that the majority of the rebel leadership and infrastructure are concentrated at this base.

If we are to have any chance of stopping the GTI, Jotunheim must be destroyed.  The GTA will launch an immediate, all-out offensive to take out the installation and its surrounding defenses.  Report to your wing stations for your specific briefings."

3521, "The $f Soyakaze has been ordered to destroy the $h Jotunheim, GTI's base of operations in $b Beta $b Aquilae.  GTI conducts their most secret operations, including xenobiological research and engineering, at this facility.  We believe the GTI has been studying Shivan technology and physiology here since first contact."

3522, "This operation will be performed in conjunction with the $f GTD $f Intrepid and the $f PVD $f Vanguard.  While the Terran and Vasudan fleets engage enemy targets throughout Beta Aquilae, our pilots will conduct a strike against Jotunheim itself.  A massive, coordinated assault on several fronts should overwhelm the GTI forces in this system and significantly improve our odds against the installation."

3523, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least six full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3524, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least four full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3525, "In the second phase, $f Zeta and $f Omicron will jump in and attack the installation's cruiser fortifications.  Once the cruisers are down, they will target and destroy the Jotunheim.  Alpha and Beta will remain on station to provide cover."

3526, "Because of the shortage of bombers on board the Soyakaze, Zeta and Omicron wings will be supplied by the Intrepid and the Vanguard respectively.  These pilots are veterans of the Great War with the Shivans and the fourteen-year war between our species, and have already seen action against the GTI on several fronts.  They are more than qualified to assist you on this mission."

3527, "If you need additional fighter support during any part of the mission, $f Gamma wing will be available as reinforcement.  Command will also deploy $f Delta and $f Epsilon, at their discretion, if the need arises."

3528, "We have only a limited tactical profile of the installation, so be prepared to engage exotic prototypes with unknown capabilities.  You are authorized to destroy any GTI vessel that interferes with your mission objectives.  However, your primary objective is to eliminate the Jotunheim.  All other targets are secondary.

Good luck, pilots."

3529, "Jotunheim has been destroyed, and with it, most of the GTI's weapon prototypes and technological research.  Unfortunately, our attempt to decapitate the GTI leadership failed, as some of the officers aboard the installation were able to escape its destruction and evade capture.  Worse, the insurgents have a new superweapon at their disposal.  The vessel that retrieved the Jotunheim's escape pods is a juggernaut of incredible proportions, capable of annihilating one of our cruisers in a single shot.  Firepower of this magnitude has heretofore been seen only on the SD Lucifer.

Reconnaissance wings have already been scrambled to track and identify this new class of ship.  Admiral Tess has informed me that our squadron may be called up to attack the superdestroyer at any time.  Dismissed."

3547, "Between the war with the Vasudans and the war with the Shivans, the GTA is on its last legs.  The best intelligence forecasts only give the GTA two years before it disintegrates!  The only organization capable of restoring order is the GTI.  You need our help!"

3548, "Excellent work!  Jotunheim's defenses have been destroyed.  Target the installation and fire at will.  Watch for enemy reinforcements."

3549, "Command, listen.  We have the prototype.  It's ready to deploy.  You can end the Vasudan war within a matter of weeks -- months at the most -- but victory is assured.  You can't simply ignore that."

3550, "It's not my call.  Times have changed, Jotunheim.  We're no longer at war with the Vasudans.  We're allies, not enemies."

3551, "We're allies in name only.  You know this cease-fire is only going to last until one race recovers enough to strike the final blow against the other.  If one of our species has to be destroyed, let's make damn sure we're the ones alive at the end."

3552, "Terran pilots, surely you can see what's going on here!  Think of your friends, your loved ones, who fought and died for fourteen years to support the Terran cause!  Now your commanders want to throw away everything they stood for!"

3553, "Pilots, you will ignore the Jotunheim's transmissions and focus on your mission objectives."

3554, "I don't know, Command.  They didn't mention any of this in the briefing.  Surely--"

3555, "Complete your mission objectives, pilot!  That's an order!"

3556, "What about the orders of the past fourteen years, huh?  What about everything we fought for?  My fiancee was on the Eisenhower, damn you!"

3557, "Terran paranoia.  How typical.  Be glad that our governments have risen above such sentiments, blind one.  I would not pardon you so freely."

3558, "Go look at your own treacherous Parliament, you sand-eating Zod, and then tell us we're not paranoid.  What are our orders, Jotunheim?"

3561, "Allied forces, the cavalry has arrived.  The Gladiator, Minotaur, Mecross, and Tatenen stand ready to assist.  Bringing full turret barrage to bear on the Jotunheim."

3562, "Jotunheim assault force, this is the Soyakaze.  Be advised our code slicers report a large rebel force en route to your position.  Destroy the Jotunheim ASAP."

3563, "Acknowledged, Soyakaze.  The Jotunheim has gone critical.  Just give us a few more moments."

3564, "Sorry, Command.  We're going to win this war whether you like it or not.  It may take a generation or two, but the Terran race will emerge victorious."

3565, "The Jotunheim has jettisoned escape pods.  Do not engage the pods, pilots.  We'll send in a team of transports to capture them."

3566, "The Jotunheim has been destroyed!  All units, stand clear!"

3567, "Command, I'm picking up an enormous jump signature here!  The readings are off the scale!"

Apocalypse

The GTA and PVE have been plunged into chaos by the appearance of the GTI's latest superweapon.  The unthinkable has happened.  Somehow, Galactic Terran Intelligence has managed to acquire a vessel with the size, armor, and firepower to rival the SD Lucifer.  Preliminary scans indicate that it is a fusion of Terran and Shivan technologies unlike anything in our arsenal."

3574, "The Hades

We now know that this vessel, designated the Hades, is the attacker that crippled the PVD Hope and destroyed the Vasudan blockade at the Beta Aquilae node.  The Hades has since gone on to obliterate several allied strongholds throughout Beta Aquilae and Vega.

Terran and Vasudan forces are scrambling to develop a strategy to counter this new threat.  All pilots have been placed on ten-minute alert."

3575, "$r RED $r ALERT!  The $f PVI $f Egyptos is under attack!  Recon has sighted multiple $h GTI fighter and bomber wings converging on the station."

3576, "We are scrambling $f Alpha and $f Beta wings to reinforce the station's depleted fighter complement.  Unfortunately, we have no conclusive intelligence on the strength of $h GTI forces in this system.  If Command determines that the $h GTI have sufficient firepower to threaten our position, the station may need to be evacuated."

3577, "Most of our ships are scouring the system in search of the $h Hades, so you will have minimal logistical support.  Hold off the $h GTI until additional fighters can be deployed to assist you."

3578, "The PVI Egyptos has been destroyed.  Thousands of innocent Vasudans perished today, and the Vega node is now defenseless against the GTI onslaught."

3579, "It is unfortunate that you fell victim to the same tactic we used against the Vasudans only four years ago.  The Karnak-class installation's main weakness, as exploited by the GTA in Operation Cardinal Spear, is standard material in any League of Defense flight school curriculum.  Were you asleep in your military history class, pilot?

Whether you were caught off guard or simply failed to intercept the bomber in time is not the issue.  Command issued you a direct order, and you were unable to react with the speed and precision that the situation required.  In this present conflict, we cannot afford the risk that one of our top pilots will fail to respond at a critical moment.

I regret to inform you that Command is pulling you from active duty until we have the rebellion under control.  Dismissed."

3580, "Break off your attack as soon as you hear that the bomber is targeting the reactor.  You have enough time to get to the reactor before he does.

Why not play the FSPort conversion of Cardinal Spear to learn the background behind this mission?  Download it from the FSPort website at http://fsport.hard-light.net/."

3581, "The PVC Thebes was vaporized with all hands on board.  The station evacuees that had boarded the Thebes also perished in the Hades's ferocious assault."

3582, "It is fortunate that you were able to save the PVC Hathor and the escaping transports.  The survivors send their gratitude.

We are also impressed that you were able to defeat the GTI's surprise attack against the Egyptos's reactor.  Your quick thinking and prompt response helped buy precious time for the survivors to escape the GTI's attack.  Well done."

3583, "We are disappointed that you were unable to save the PVC Hathor from the GTI assault.  In the face of today's events, even a few hundred additional survivors would have boosted morale."

3584, "Since the GTI fighters arrive all over the place, it's a matter of luck whether or not you'll be near the Hathor when it's attacked.  Assigning your wingmen to protect it will buy you some time, but you still need to be ready to come to its defense when Roskva wing arrives."

3585, "In appreciation of your performance in our operations with allied Vasudans, you are hereby awarded the Vasudan Alliance Medal.  For your courageous defense of the PVI Egyptos, the PVD Hope, and many other Vasudan vessels, the Parliament of Vasuda sends its thanks."

3586, "Our direct losses to the Hades now include the PVI Egyptos, the PVD Vanguard, and twelve cruisers.  For all our sakes, let us hope that a weakness in its defenses can be found soon.

We have reacquired sensor lock on the juggernaut and are attempting to track it through subspace.  Our squadron will be redeployed ASAP to intercept the vessel when it arrives at its destination.  Report to the briefing room on the double."

3634, "Abandon Hope"

3635, "Our hero must scan the subsystems of the Hades in a desperate attempt to find a weakness."

3636, "Command has located the $h Hades near the jump node to $b Deneb.  The superdestroyer is travelling without escort but remains a formidable adversary on its own.  We cannot risk a direct attack until we have more information on its strengths and weaknesses."

3637, "$f Alpha $f 1, you have been selected to fly reconnaissance against the Hades.  Command has requested data regarding the $b communications, $b sensors, $b weapons, and $b navigation subsystems of the warship.  Information on the $b fighterbay and $b engine subsystems would also be valuable, but they are not as critical."

3638, "The $f GTSC $f Herschel will oversee this operation.  Your fighter's computer will be linked to the Herschel's computer, and your fighter will automatically upload your scan data as it is acquired."

3639, "To protect itself from the Hades's powerful beam weaponry, the Herschel will attempt to mask its sensor signature.  This will prevent the Hades's computers from acquiring target lock on the vessel, and the Herschel's small size should make manual targeting nearly impossible.  If we're lucky, the gunners on the Hades won't bother with her."

3640, "Choose your loadout quickly, pilot.  We won't have much time before the Hades leaves the system.  This is the best chance we have to get the intelligence we need.  Let's make the most of it."

3641, "The events we have just witnessed have dramatically underscored the necessity of defeating the GTI rebellion.  The Hades survived both the collision with and the explosion of a fully-armed Typhon-class destroyer.  The crew of the PVD Hope sacrificed their lives and their ship in a valiant attempt to bring victory to the GTA and PVE.  Though they were unsuccessful, they will be remembered with honor.

Unfortunately, Command must still deal with the consequences of the failed strike.  Although the Hope had unloaded her pilots and non-essential personnel before moving against the Hades, we have lost a well-trained and highly skilled command crew.  With our weakened fleets dispersed over several systems to contain the rebellion, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we will not be able to marshal sufficient forces quickly enough to confront the Hades.  We have no choice but to attack with what we have.  Command hopes that between the intelligence acquired from the Repulse and the scan data obtained from our reconnaissance, we should be able to find a weakness in the Hades before it reaches its destination."

3642, "However, you failed to scan the required subsystems on the Hades, forcing us to depend on the long-range sensor data transmitted by the Herschel.  Without the tactical intelligence we had hoped to obtain, our analysts will lack the information they need to plan an effective counterattack.

You were selected for this mission based on your impressive record of successful reconnaissance missions, and Command is extremely disappointed in your failure to live up to your reputation.  Perhaps your abilities are better demonstrated in standard assault and defense missions rather than situations requiring quick thinking and tactical improvisation.

Admiral Tess has approved your transfer back to the GTD Intrepid.  The containment effort will benefit greatly from someone with your piloting skill, but for our attack against the Hades we need pilots who excel in all areas of combat engagement.  The Soyakaze will jump to Deneb in six hours, so you have until then to collect your belongings.  Your transport will be waiting in the hangar."

3643, "Take out the first few fighters immediately, and then scan a subsystem or two in the interval between waves.  If you keep doing this, you should be able to get at least three subsystems.  Make sure you scan the communications, sensors, weapons, and navigation subsystems before any others."

3644, "Our reconnaissance was mostly successful, as you scanned three of the required four subsystems on the Hades.  Although we had hoped for a complete tactical profile of the juggernaut, your performance was satisfactory, considering the circumstances.  Our analysts will have a difficult time planning an effective counterattack, but the data you obtained should significantly improve our odds."

3645, "Our reconnaissance was a complete success, as you scanned all four of the required subsystems on the Hades.  Excellent work.  Our tacticians are analyzing the data you acquired as we speak, and we expect to receive a preliminary report in a few hours.  This information will significantly improve our odds in the upcoming counterattack."

3646, "Additionally, you were able to scan the Hades's fighterbay.  Intelligence has expressed great alarm at your findings, but their analysis remains classified for the time being."

3647, "You were also able to scan one of the Hades's engines.  Our engineers are incorporating your findings into their analysis as they search for a weakness in the juggernaut's defenses.  This information may explain why the Hades was temporarily disabled."

3648, "Admiral Tess has taken special note of your performance over the last few missions and has selected you to lead the attack against the Hades.  Your familiarity with the juggernaut's defenses will give us an extra edge in the upcoming battle, and your proven leadership and piloting skill are unequaled in this squadron.

Command has allowed our strategists and tacticians six hours to formulate a battle plan, after which the Soyakaze will jump to Deneb to pursue the Hades.  In the meantime, I suggest you get some rest.  Dismissed."

GTI Rebellion

The GTA, PVE, and GTI are now engaged in an all-out conflict that could determine the future of Terran-Vasudan history.  Although the bulk of the GTI fleet has been contained in Beta Aquilae and Vega, the GTI flagship Hades is still at large and must be stopped.  The Soyakaze is the only ship within range to intercept the juggernaut before she can carry out her ultimate objective.  Victory or defeat will be decided in the next few hours.

You are being informed on a need-to-know basis about the Hades project, and are hereby notified that all information regarding it is classified Level Omega.  Divulging this information, directly or indirectly, to any persons other than those specifically authorized by the Galactic Terran Alliance is a treasonous offense, punishable by death."

3694, "Project Hades

The GTD Hades was conceived and designed in 2324, when it became apparent that the Terran-Vasudan War would not be won decisively in a matter of months.  This superdestroyer would be nearly invulnerable to bomber, cruiser, and destroyer attacks, and would be able to mount full-scale planetary assaults unaided.  Construction began the following year, in the Delta Serpentis shipyards.

When the Shivans arrived in 2335, the Hades was nearing completion.  The GTI conducted extensive studies of the aliens, particularly of the Lucifer, and put the new developments to use in the Hades.  With their ultimate weapon now boasting Shivan beam weaponry and Terran-Shivan hybrid systems, GTI forces waited for the deployment order from GTA High Command.

But the order never came.  Unlike every other cease-fire over the course of the Terran-Vasudan War, this one held.  The GTA and PVE set aside their differences to counter the Shivan threat, and in the process developed a grudging respect for each other."

3695, "GTI's Objective

Galactic Terran Intelligence, however, could not easily discard the investment and momentum of ten years' worth of work on the Hades.  According to statements by captured operatives, the GTI concluded that the GTA had lost sight of its original goal and decided to take matters into its own hands.

The GTI appears to have been positioning itself to overthrow the GTA government, as soon as the Terrans had recovered enough from the Great War to stand on their own.  Once the Shivans were defeated, the GTI would dissolve the Terran-Vasudan treaty and strike the final blow against the PVE.  The Terran-Vasudan War would finally be won."

3696, "A Final Gambit

The exposure of the GTI conspiracy has prevented their plan from coming to fruition, but the GTI may yet succeed in their ultimate objective.  Our reconnaissance against the Hades has indicated that its engines are enhanced with Shivan components, which may enable the juggernaut to use jump nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels.  Command believes that, rather than pursuing a random course of destruction, the Hades is actually en route to Altair and Aldebaran via the Deneb-Altair phasing jump node.

This maneuver would effectively allow the Hades to slip behind Vasudan lines, beyond any possibility of interception by GTA or PVE forces.  The Deneb-Altair jump node is no longer stable enough for our ships to traverse, which means that any counterattack would have to go the long way around via Alpha Centauri.  By then, the Hades will have had more than enough time to devastate the Vasudan home systems unopposed."

3697, "Our Response

There are some within the GTA who favor the GTI in this conflict.  Indeed, many officers and pilots have defected to the GTI, and many others have argued that the Vasudans would behave the same as the GTI if they were in the same position.  I can only answer by saying that I believe this is the right thing to do, and I believe the Vasudans would defend us if the situation were reversed.

It may be difficult for each species to see past the horrors of the past fourteen years, but the Vasudans seem to be holding up their end of the bargain.  The PVE continued to work closely with the GTA in our campaign to track and destroy the Lucifer, even after the devastation of Vasuda Prime removed their main motivation for doing so.  And the GTA and PVE continue to share military resources and intelligence even today.  We should honor their continued support with our own.  History will determine whether we made the right choice in doing so."

3698, "The $h Hades has been tracked to an abandoned cargo depot in orbit around $b Deneb $b III.  This once-prosperous colony was utterly destroyed by the Shivans earlier this year, and the shattered remains of many warships drift nearby.  The Hades's engines are currently offline, and we believe she is repairing the damage sustained in the collision with the $f PVD $f Hope.  This may be our only chance to destroy the juggernaut before it reaches $b Altair."

3699, "The $f Soyakaze is making the subspace jump to $b Deneb as we speak.  Advance fighter wings will be launched immediately upon the Soyakaze's arrival in the system, and the Soyakaze herself will move into position to challenge the Hades directly as soon as her jump drives are recharged.  The Hades has five main beam cannons that must be destroyed for the Soyakaze to have a chance of victory."

3700, "$f Alpha wing will fly tactical assault, using $b Tsunami bombs to destroy the Hades's beam emplacements.  $f Beta wing will cover them.  When the Soyakaze arrives to confront the Hades, $f Delta and $f Epsilon wings will also be deployed."

3701, "We have a limited window of opportunity to destroy the Hades before it concludes its activity at the depot and leaves the system.  The capabilities of this warship are unthinkable, and in the hands of the GTI it is a terrible weapon.

The security of the Terran and Vasudan species is in your hands now, pilots.  You know the consequences of failure.  Good luck."

3702, "Congratulations, pilots!  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered.  Had we failed here, the GTI would be writing the history books."

3703, "Welcome to the GTD Intrepid, pilots.  The destruction of the GTD Soyakaze is a tragedy for everyone in the Alliance, especially for those of you so recently stationed on the GTD Krios.  Fortunately, the Soyakaze was not lost in vain.  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered."

3704, "Members of the provisional GTA government have already begun the process of reconstruction in cooperation with our Vasudan allies.  It is ironic that, far from tearing our two species apart, this conflict has brought them closer together than ever before.  Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group, has expressed interest in personally meeting with the pilots who flew against the Hades -- a rare gesture on the part of a Vasudan."

3705, "Debris from the Hades is still raining down on Deneb III.  Due to the sensitive nature of the technology it contained, the planet will be quarantined until the wreckage can be disposed of.  Terran Command has classified all data regarding the technology used in this engagement, though we can probably expect to see these advances in future Terran and Vasudan warship designs."

3706, "We failed to stop the Hades before it could repair its engines, and the GTI superweapon successfully made the subspace jump to Altair.  It has only been a few short hours since the battle ended, but our worst fears have been confirmed.

We have already started to receive reports on the devastation being wrought in Altair and Aldebaran.  Hundreds of thousands of Vasudans are believed dead, and many of the PVN's highest-ranking officers have committed ritual suicide, including Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group.  Most alarmingly, Hammer of Light cells in Altair have begun to change their rhetoric, claiming that the prophesied Great Destroyers are not the Shivans after all, but the Terrans."

3707, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.  In our battle against the Hades, the odds were against us, and the sentiments of fourteen years are not easily pushed aside by the events of six months.  As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis.  In the face of overwhelming opposition from our former allies, Admiral Tess and the Soyakaze have surrendered."

3708, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.

As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis."

3732, "Pilots, you must destroy the Hades at all costs!  The GTI must be stopped here and now!"

3733, "Good work, pilots.  All the beam cannons facing the Soyakaze have been destroyed.  Continue your attack."

3734, "The Hades has deployed bombers!  We are launching Theta wing to intercept."

3735, "This is Admiral Amentep of the PVD Guardian.  Allied Terran vessels, please respond."

3736, "This is Admiral Tess of the GTD Soyakaze.  Greetings, Admiral.  I was not aware that the Guardian had been repaired yet."

3737, "Regrettably, it has not.  We are still in orbit around Cygnus Prime.  But let us dispense with protocol, for the time is short.  Am I correct in assuming that you have engaged the GTI destroyer Hades?"

3738, "Affirmative, Admiral.  Our bombers are attacking the Hades near Deneb III."

3739, "And so the circle completes itself.  Remarkable.  I wish to inform you, Admiral, that one of our fighter squadrons just repelled a Hammer of Light ambush against the GTC Orff and two bomber wings."

3740, "These craft had entered the Deneb system in an attempt to engage the Hades, but were apparently provided incorrect information by a traitor sympathetic to the GTI.  If you will transmit your coordinates, I will redeploy the Orff and its wings to your location."

3741, "Transmitting now.  Admiral Amentep, you have our sincerest gratitude."

3742, "The gratitude is ours, but you may repay us by recounting the story of your victory over the GTI.  Sa Terra, vessels of the GTA.  Admiral Amentep out."

3743, "GTC Orff now on station.  We are targeting the Hades."

3744, "Holy crap, the Orff is down!  It never even had a chance!"

3745, "The Orff will be avenged today, pilot, as will every other victim of the GTI.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3746, "It's good to see you again, Orff.  I really like your new friends."

3747, "Iota 1 here.  If you can keep those fighters off us, pilots, we'll take down that juggernaut faster than you can blink."

3748, "This is Pi 1.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3749, "Oh, hell... Command, the Hades is moving!"

3750, "The Hades appears to have channelled all of its remaining power into its main engines.  Pilots, you must either disable or destroy the Hades before it can escape.  Move it!"

3751, "The Hades is jumping out!"

3752, "Damn it, pilots! ... All right, we're attempting to track the Hades through subspace.  Return to base quickly and we might be able to redeploy you to its new location."

3753, "How are we ever going to kill this thing?  It's twice as big as an Orion and probably eight times as strong!"

3754, "Just keep fighting.  This is the same as every other assault mission you've been on, it's just going to take longer.  Stay focused.  The Hades isn't going anywhere."

3755, "We're lucky the Hope managed to hit the engine array.  The more strain we can put on this ship, the better.  I'm guessing those Terran-Shivan integrated systems aren't entirely stable."

3756, "I don't believe this.  We're actually winning!"

3761, "While you were able to survive the first phase of Terran enemies, you were unable to meet the challenge presented to you by the other waves.  Your performance was what we would expect from a rookie fresh from flight school."

3762, "You were able to survive two phases of Terran enemies before you evacuated the Gauntlet.  This was a marginally satisfactory performance, one that we might expect from an Alliance reserve pilot."

3763, "You conquered three phases of Terran fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

3764, "You almost ran the entire Gauntlet, Pilot.  Excellent job.  Very few pilots could ever hope to emulate your accomplishment.  We are definitely going to keep our eye on you, Pilot.  You might want to consider meeting the final challenge of the Gauntlet sometime in the future.  Dismissed."

3766, "Vasudan Gauntlet"

3767, "The player runs the Gauntlet against an ever-increasing rush of Vasudans."

3769, "You conquered three phases of Vasudan fighters before conceding defeat.  You performed well and with honor.  If you ever feel particularly adventurous, you might want to attempt to defeat all of the ships in the Gauntlet.  Well done, Pilot."

3770, "You successfully ran the Gauntlet, Pilot!  Congratulations!  Your performance was truly amazing.  To recognize your skill as a fighter pilot, the Alliance will send you into tremendously risky and dangerous battle situations.  Your courage inspires confidence in your fellow pilots and in the Alliance.  Again, a most excellent job, Pilot."

3771, "Your hull can't take much more, Pilot.  You may exit the Gauntlet without fear of losing honor, if you wish."

3840, "What we are most impressed with, however, is your protection of each and every ship.  We did not lose a single freighter or transport, and the Mecross is safe from Shivan bombers.

For continued service to the Alliance, we are awarding you the Good Conduct Medal.  Keep it up."

3850, "We lost many escape pods in the battle as well.  Such a loss of life is difficult to bear.  Several key scientists were unable to evacuate the installation.  They, and their research, will be sorely missed."

334, "Entwickelt in einer gemeinsamen Operation der vasudanischen und terranischen Regierung, ist der GTF Ulysses ein ausgezeichneter, überall einsetzbarer, Jäger. Er bietet überragende Manövrierfähigkeit und eine hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit."

340, "Der Apollo ist der gebräuchlichste GTA-Jäger. Er ist höchst vielseitig und kann mehrere Rollen übernehmen, inklusive Raumüberlegenheit, Abfänge und Angriffe."

341, "Abfänger"

342, "Gut"

343, "Hochgeschwindigkeitsaufklärer und Bomberabfangjäger. Bietet hohe Waffenkompatibilität und Zuladung."

344, "Mit dem $quoteGTF Angel$quote-Aufklärungsjäger als Vorlage, entwickelte die GTA die Valkyrie Abfängerin. Diese hat zwei zusätzliche Antriebe, wie auch einen zusätzlichen Satz an Primären Waffenhalterungen. Dies macht die Valkyrie zur besten Bomberabfängerin in der Flotte. Ihre Geschwindigkeit ist in der GTA unübertroffen und ihre Manövrierfähigkeit ist überdurchschnittlich. Ihre einzigen Nachteile sind die kleine sekundäre Zuladung und die schwache Hülle."

345, "Schwerer Angreifer"

346, "Durchschnittlich"

347, "Seine niedrige Höchstgeschwindigkeit wird durch seine enormen Offensivfähigkeiten ausgeglichen. Hohe Waffenkapazität."

348, "Der Hercules ist die tragende Säule der terranischen Flotte. Er ist der langsamste und schwerstkontrollierbarste Jäger in der Flotte. Dies wird jedoch durch seine überwältigenden Waffen und Schilde ausgeglichen. Er trägt sechs primäre Waffen, wie auch zwei vollständige Sekundärbuchten. Dieser schwere Angriffsjäger ist am besten für Angriffe auf kleine Ziele und der Bombereskorte geeignet."

349, "Aufklärer"

350, "Hoch"

351, "Gering"

352, "Hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit auf Kosten einer winzigen Zuladung. Hohe Waffenkompatibilität."

353, "Entworfen von GTI-Ingenieuren, ist der Loki zweifellos das beste Aufklärungsschiff im terranischen oder vasudanischen Einsatz. Seine Hüllenform und die abgeschirmte Reaktorkammer sorgen nicht nur für ein geringes Sensorprofil, sondern auch für die Fähigkeit von Hochgeschwindigkeitsmanövern. Für erweiterte Gefechte ist er wegen der relativ leichten Bewaffnung und der geringen Panzerung jedoch ungeeignet."

354, "Geringe Offensivfähigkeiten. Am besten in Schwärmen verwendet."

355, "Der alte Angel Aufklärungsjäger muss sich in Sachen Dienstzeit und Anzahl der Abschüsse nur dem Apollo geschlagen geben. Entwickelt als ein Abfang- und Aufklärungsjäger in den ersten Jahren des Terranisch-Vasudanischen Krieges, entwickelte er sich zu einem beeindruckenden Gegenstück zum PVF Anubis und anderen frühen vasudanischen Jägern. Verbesserungen an dem Apollo machten den Angel weitgehend überflüssig und der ursprüngliche Entwurf wurde zugunsten seiner Nachfolgerin, der GTF Valkyrie, außer Dienst gestellt."

356, "Leichter Bomber"

357, "Dynamic Metamer"

358, "Ausgezeichnet für überfallartige Bombardierung. Gute Geschwindigkeit für ihre Größe, mit einer hohen Nachbrennerreservekapazität."

359, "Als kleinster Bomber in der Flotte, wurde die Athena wurde schon des Öfteren mit einem Jäger verwechselt. Jedoch sollte jemand durch ihre kleine Größe nicht getäuscht werden. Die Athena kann leichte Bomben und die meisten Raketen tragen. Ebenso hat sie gute Nahkampffähigkeiten. Ihre starken Schilde und Hülle machen Sie zum bevorzugten $quoteBlitzbomber$quote der GTA."

360, "Stoßbomber"

361, "Schlecht"

362, "Ausgezeichnet für überfallartige Bombardierung. Kann Tsunamis tragen. Guter Nachbrennervorrat."

363, "Als ein weiteres Resultat der F&E des GTI, ist der Zeus Angriffsbomber ein würdiger Nachfolger zur Athena. Sein ausgeglichener Entwurf und seine erhöhte Reaktorkapazität geben ihm eine bemerkenswerte Geschwindigkeit für einen Bomber, wobei er in der Lage bleibt, die mächtigen Tsunami zu tragen. Diese Merkmale machen den Zeus zu einer vielseitigen und effektiven Waffe gegen Großkampfschiffe."

364, "Schwerer Bomber"

365, "Schwer"

366, "Geeignet für alle Zielgrößen. Trägt die meisten Raketentypen, aber nur wenige Geschütze. Zwar bewaffnet mit einem Verteidigungsturm, erfordert aber weiterhin Eskorte."

367, "Die Medusa ist der Standardangriffsbomber der GTA. Ihre starken Schilde und große Sekundärkapazität machen sie zum bevorzugten Angriffsschiff gegen Ziele der Kreuzer-Klasse. Als der erste Bomber, welcher die Tsunami tragen kann, gilt die Medusa als der Grund für eine Karriere als Bomberpilot."

368, "Angriffsbomber"

369, "Sehr schlecht"

370, "Entworfen um Großkampfschiffe und Kreuzer zu vernichten. Langsam, bietet aber unvergleichliche Angriffsbombardierungsfähigkeiten."

371, "Die Ursa ist der erste Bomber, der speziell für die Vernichtung von Großkampfschiffen entworfen wurde. Sie trägt eine riesige Zuladung und ist der einzige Bomber in der GTA, welcher die Harbinger bestücken kann. Durch die starken Schilde und Hülle ist eine Ursa nur sehr schwer zu zerstören."

372, "Die Amazon ist eine einfache Drohne, die zum grundlegenden Kampftraining verwendet wird. Sie sind unbemannt und tragen nur die schwächsten Bewaffnungen."

373, "Die Advanced Amazon ist eine größere Drohne, welche von der GTA für Subsystem- und dem Großzieltraining verwendet wird. Sie sind unbemannt und billig."

374, "Das Centaur-Versorgungsschiff ist dafür entwickelt so schnell wie möglich in den Kampf hinein- wie auch herauszukommen. Er ist schnell und ziemlich manövrierfähig, was ihm gestattet mit möglichst geringem Zeiteinsatz mit Jägern anzudocken. Am bemerkenswertesten an dem Centaur ist jedoch sein extrem großer Explosionsradius. Die Menge an Sprengköpfen, die auf einem Versorgungsschiff befördert werden, machen es sehr gefährlich in der Nähe eines explodierenden Centaurs zu sein."

375, "Seit Beginn der Weltraumkolonisation wird dieser Standardtransporter von jedem, egal ob Zivil oder im Militär, genutzt. Während er immer wieder kleineren Veränderungen unterzogen wurde, behielt er seinen einfachen Entwurf bei: Ein Schiff, was für den Transport von Personal von einem Ort zum anderen gedacht ist."

376, "Taktischer Transporter"

377, "Sehr schwer"

378, "Kallisti Corporation"

379, "Entworfen für die taktische Anlieferung von Truppen an gegnerischen Positionen. Geringe Manövrierfähigkeit wird durch die hohe Panzerungsbewertung und Höchstgeschwindigkeit ausgeglichen."

380, "Der GTT Hunter wurde von dem GTI für Präzisionsschlägen entworfen, die nur kleine Truppen an hochtrainierten Marines benötigen. Schneller, kleiner und stärker bewaffnet als die Elysiums, ist er dazu in der Lage eine beschränkte Anzahl an Offensivrollen neben dem Transport von Soldaten und Fracht durchzuführen. Der GTI nutzt hauptsächlich diese Schiffe um kleine Teams an Spezialeinheiten abzusetzen, die den Gegner in Vorbereitung größerer Angriffe mit konventionellen Entertruppen schwächen sollen."

381, "Der Poseidon ist der Standardmilitärfrachter der GTA. Er wurde entworfen, um seine Fracht gegen alle Arten an Angriffe zu verteidigen und besitzt dafür auch vier Türme."

382, "Der TC2 ist der standardausgegebene Frachtbehälter der GTA für Frachttransporte im tiefen Raum. Er besitzt die nötige Elektronik und Systeme, um jede Form an Fracht zu bewahren, ganz unabhängig davon, welche Bedingungen dafür nötig sind. TC 2s sind günstig herzustellen und werden häufig überall in der Allianz verwendet."

383, "Der TSC 2 wurde entworfen, als das terranische Oberkommando entschied, dass es für die Nutzung in militärischen Operationen einen robusteren und sichereren Frachtbehälter benötigt. Dieser verbessert den etablierten $quoteTC 2$quote-Entwurf, indem er eine geringe Menge seines internen Platzes für eine bedeutend stärkere Hülle opfert. Obwohl er nicht so robust ist, wie der TAC 1, ist der TSC 2 für die GTA der Behälter der Wahl, wenn es um Fracht militärischen Wertes geht."

384, "Der TTC 1 ist ein weiteres Beispiel für zivile Ausrüstung, welche von der GTA-Verteidigungsliga verwendet wird. Er ist hauptsächlich ein technischer Behälter, welcher für Forschungszwecke, insbesondere Null-G-Entwicklungsoperationen, genutzt wird. Er ist jedoch nicht sehr robust und ist oft das Ziel gegnerischer Angriffe."

385, "Der Chronos ist ein Frachter zivilen Entwurfs. Als sich der Terranisch-Vasudanische Krieg hinzog, wurden immer mehr dieser Schiffe von der GTA, für militärische Operationen, in Dienst gestellt. Diese Schiffe sind langsam, aber robust."

386, "Der TAC 1, von den meisten Piloten TakEins genannt, ist ein schwer gepanzerter Behälter, welcher gewöhnlich für das Befördern von flüchtigen oder gefährlichen Substanzen genutzt wird. Er ist ebenso der bevorzugte Versorgungsbehälter zur Nutzung bei Frontlinienoperationen."

387, "Die tragende Säule der Terranischen Flotte, diese Schiffe dienen sowohl den Angriffs- als auch Verteidigungszwecken. Von Bug bis Heck misst ein Fenris 260 Meter. Mit einem umfangreichen Spektrum an Waffensystemen und einer Hülle, die stark genug ist, um selbst den stärksten gegnerischen Sprengköpfen zu widerstehen, kann ein Fenris-Kreuzer in nahezu jedem System gefunden werden, in dem die GTA operiert. Der Fenris wurde ursprünglich als Angriffswaffe entworfen, daher auch seine hohe Geschwindigkeit und anständige Wendigkeit. Als deutlich wurde, dass der Terranisch-Vasudanische Krieg nicht in ein paar Monaten vorbei sein würde, wurde entschieden, dass eine zweite Serie an Kreuzern hergestellt werden soll, die den Verteidigungszwecken dient."

388, "Nachdem die Vasudaner mit Ihren Einfällen in den GTA-Raum begannen, entschied das Oberkommando, dass ein neuer Verteidigungskreuzer nötig ist. Veränderungen an der Fenris führten zur $quoteGTC Leviathan$quote-Serie an Kreuzern, welche als mobile Verteidigungskriegsschiffe entworfen wurden. Ihre Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit wurden deutlich auf Kosten mächtigerer Waffen und einer stärkeren Hülle gesenkt. Die Produktion wurde eingestellt, als die GTA dachte, dass sie den vasudanischen Krieg nach der Schlacht um Gulnara gewinnen würde und die Produktion wurde wiederaufgenommen, nach der Niederlage im Talania-System. Aufgrund der immer-mal-wieder-Produktion dieses Schiffes, besitzen fast alle Leviathan-Kreuzer eine unterschiedliche Bewaffnung, aber alle besitzen eine einheitliche Hülle und Geschwindigkeit."

389, "Das Faustus-Forschungsschiff war, und ist nach wie vor, ein ziviles Schiff. In den vierzehn Jahren seit Beginn des terranisch-vasudanischen Krieges wurden jedoch mehr und mehr dieser Schiffe von der GTA für die Verfolgung militärischer Forschungen in Dienst gestellt. Sein offensichtlicher Wert, seine schwachen Kampffähigkeiten und seine fehlende Geschwindigkeit machen ihn zum Hauptziel gegnerischer Schiffe, weshalb selten viele von ihnen in der Nähe der Frontlinien gefunden werden."

390, "Die standardmäßige terranische Sonde ist ein Allzweckinstrument, welches in vielfältigen Situationen verwendet wird. Sie können in Missionen gefunden werden, die von der unbemannten Erforschung neuer Systeme, zur Wissenschaftlichen Beobachtung interessanter Bereiche im Raum bis hin zur Begutachtung von Patrouillenrouten oder vermuteten gegnerischen Positionen reichen. Im Notfall können sie auch als Kommunikationsbojen oder als Kuriere für wichtige Nachrichten oder wissenschaftlicher Daten genutzt werden. Ihre großartige Geschwindigkeit und kleine Größe machen sie auch in Kampfsituationen nützlich, wo der Gegner ihnen sehr wahrscheinlich nur eine geringe Zielpriorität geben."

391, "Der GTD Hades ist eine neue Klasse von terranischen Zerstörern, die unter der Vollmacht des GTI konstruiert wurde. Es ist nicht viel über seinen Entwurf oder Zweck bekannt, allerdings erscheint es ein Versuch zu sein, die SD Lucifer nachzubauen. Alle verfügbaren Daten zur Hades wurden vom terranischen Oberkommando als streng geheim erklärt.

Der Hades sollte als eine Gefahr betrachtet werden, die größer ist, als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung."

392, "Frühe terranische Raumstationen wurden deutlich kleiner konstruiert und wurden meistens für Null-G-Forschungszwecke verwendet. Mit den Fortschritten in den Raumkonstruktionstechnologien wurden die Stationen später immer größer und größer. Als die erste Station der Arcadia-Klasse in den Dienst gestellt wurde, entschied sich die GTA dazu, sie als Installationsanlage anstatt als Raumstation neu einzustufen. Genutzt für vielfältige Zwecke, ist nahezu jedes Hauptsystem die Heimat von mindestens einer Installationsanlage, welche oft als Zentrum für Handel und Kommunikation verwendet wird. Als Heimat zahlreicher kleiner Schiffe, einschließlich Reparaturschiffen, Jägern und Transportern, ist eine Anlage der Arcadia-Klasse immer ein sicherer Hafen für einen Konvoi von Angriffsschiffen, die von einem Kampf zurückkehren. Wo die Orion das Symbol der terranischen Macht ist, ist die Arcadia das Leuchtfeuer für Stabilität."

393, "Die GTI Polaris ist die standardmäßige Trockendockeinrichtung der GTA. Ein Netzwerk von Polarismodulen erlaubt die Konstruktion und Wartung von nahezu jedem terranischen Schiff, welches sich im Dienst befindet. Der modulare Entwurf des Trockendocks erlaubt einen günstigen Ersatz von beschädigten Sektionen, sollte eine dieser Einrichtungen unter Beschuss geraten."

394, "Asteroidenbasen wie diese, werden sowohl von zivilen, als auch militärischen Auftragnehmern genutzt, um Ressourcen abzubauen und Experimente durchzuführen."

395, "Die terranische Navigationsboje ist sowohl im zivilen, wie auch militärischen Bereich weit verbreitet. Sie speichert vorberechnete Sprungkoordinaten und andere Navigationsdaten für die Nutzung von terranischen Konvois und ist auch in der Lage als Kommunikationsrelais zu dienen."

396, "Der Watchdog ist der standardmäßig unbemannte Verteidigungswachturm der GTA. Er feuert zwei standardmäßige Plasmastöße auf alle nahen feindlichen Ziele."

397, "Der Cerberus ist die fortschrittlichere Version des Watchdogs mit stärkeren Waffen und der Fähigkeit mehr Schaden auszuhalten."

398, "Die Hermes-Fluchtkapsel wird seit der Zerstörung der GTD Goliath vor über zwölf Jahren eingesetzt. Sie werden von der Besatzung von Zerstörern und Installationsanlagen verwendet, um der Zerstörung zu entkommen. Es ist immer am besten, vorbereitet zu sein."

399, "Mekhu Enterprises/Triton Dynamics"

400, "Ausgezeichneter, überall einsetzbarer Jäger. Bietet überlegende Manövrierfähigkeit und eine hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit. Kleinere Raketenzuladung, als andere PVN-Jäger."

401, "Entwickelt in einer gemeinsamen Operation der vasudanischen und terranischen Regierung, ist der GTF Ulysses ein ausgezeichneter, überall einsetzbarer, Jäger. Er bietet überragende Manövrierfähigkeit und eine hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit.

Der PVF Ulysses ist nahezu identisch zum GTF Ulysses, außer dass die vasudanische Variante vasudanische Piloten in sein Cockpit unterbringen kann."

402, "Leichtes Gefecht"

403, "Mekhu Enterprises"

404, "Vasudanisches Schiff mit niedrigster Leistungsfähigkeit. Bietet wenig Offensiv- oder Defensivfähigkeiten. Am besten in Schwärmen verwendet."

405, "Der Anubis ist der schwächste Jäger in der vasudanischen Navy. Allerdings ist dieser Jäger sehr kostengünstig in der Produktion und wird oft in Schwärmen eingesetzt, um zu versuchen den Gegner zahlenmäßig zu überwältigen. Ein paar radikale Vasudaner wurden dafür bekannt, diese Schiffe mit Sprengstoff zu beladen und zu versuchen, diese in GTA-Großkampfschiffe zu steuern. Das erste Mal, als dies vorkam, war in der Schlacht um Rexias IV, als die GTD Goliath durch ein Geschwader von Kamikazepiloten zerstört wurde.

Aufgrund des Mangels an Nachbrennern und seiner geringen Waffenkapazität, hat die GTA den Anubis als eine Klasse-D-Bedrohung eingestuft."

406, "Schwerer Jäger"

407, "Langsam und Träge, aber schwer gepanzert. Hat eine hohe Nachbrennergeschwindigkeit. Nützlich für überfallartige Angriffe. Hohe Zuladungskapazität."

408, "Als der langsamste Jäger der PVN hat sich der Seth ein Ruf als Schildkröte der vasudanischen Flotte verdient. Obwohl er in seiner Größe sehr kompakt ist, kann der Seth eine gewaltige Zuladung tragen und hat ein starkes Schild. Seine standardmäßigen Impulsantriebe sind nicht sehr leistungsfähig, aber der Seth gewinnt einen unglaublichen Geschwindigkeitsschub, wenn er seine Nachbrenner einsetzt. Der Seth wird hauptsächlich bei Konvoiangriffen und Eskortieraufgaben für Großkampfschiffe eingesetzt.

Die GTA hält den PVF Seth für eine Klasse-C-Bedrohung."

409, "Sehr gut"

410, "Akheton Corporation"

411, "Extrem schnell mit guter Waffenkompatibilität. Sehr nützlich in jeder Art von Einsätzen."

412, "Der Horus-Abfänger kann jedes Schiff der PVN oder GTA hinter sich lassen. Dies macht ihn extrem gefährlich. Seine überdurchschnittliche Waffenkapazität, kombiniert mit einer guten Manövrierfähigkeit und Schilden, machen diesen zu einem der besten konzipierten Abfänger in der Galaxis. Dieses Schiff ist für die Zerstörung von mehr GTA-Bombern verantwortlich, als irgendein anderes.

Als eine Bedrohung der Klasse C, sollte man sich so schnell wie möglich um Horus-Abfänger kümmern."

413, "Sahr Corporation"

414, "Ausgezeichneter Jäger. Klein und schwer zu treffen, mit entsprechender Manövrierfähigkeit und Geschwindigkeit. Gute Zuladung machen ihn zum vielseitigsten Jäger der PVN."

415, "Der Thoth ist das gefährlichste Schiff, was von der PVN erschaffen wurde. Ausschließlich in den Altair-Schiffswerfen hergestellt, wurde der Thoth bisher nur in kleinen Stückzahlen produziert. Als die Altair-Schiffswerft zum Hammer des Lichts überlief, sank die Produktion von Thoths durch die PVN auf null. Der Thoth ist jetzt vollständig in den Händen des Hammes des Lichts.

Was den Thoth so vielseitig macht, ist seine kleine Größe, die ausgezeichnete Manövrierfähigkeit und die fortgeschrittenen Waffensysteme. In den Händen eines erfahrenen Piloten ist er extrem schwer zu treffen. Der Entwurf für den Thoth fand gleichzeitig mit dem der Ulysses statt und beide Schiffe wurden teilweise von denselben Technikern entworfen. Damit ist er ein Ebenbild zu unseren Jägern der Ulysses-Klasse. Aus diesem Grund werden sie als eine B-Klasse-Bedrohung angesehen. Alle nicht registrierten Thoths sollten sofort zerstört und ihre Anwesenheit nach Missionsabschluss gemeldet werden."

416, "Bomber"

417, "Geringe Manövrierfähigkeit und geringe Höchstgeschwindigkeit. Trägt jedoch eine gute Zuladung, einschließlich Weltraumbomben. Am häufigsten in Kreuzerangriffen genutzt."

418, "Die Osiris ist inzwischen der Standardbomber, der bei PVN-Operationen verwendet wird. Sie hat den Amun ersetzt, wobei sie viele der Fehler ihres Vorgängers korrigiert. Sie ist nicht ganz so robust, besitzt aber fast die gleiche Waffenkapazität und ist schneller, wie auch wendiger.

Die Osiris sollte als eine Klasse-C-Bedrohung für Fenris-Kreuzer und andernfalls als Klasse-D-Bedrohung betrachtet werden."

419, "Geringste Manövrierfähigkeit und extrem geringe Höchstgeschwindigkeit. Fliegendes Ziel, aber der schwerste Bomber der PVN. Gegen Großkampfschiffe verwendet."

420, "Der Amun ist das schwerste vasudanische Schiff der Bomber-Klasse. Er trägt eine massive Zuladung und war für die Zerstörung von mindestens drei Zerstörern der Orion-Klasse in den letzten zwei Jahren verantwortlich. Glücklicherweise ist er langsam und hat eine geringe Manövrierfähigkeit, was ihn für unsere Jäger zu einem leichten Ziel macht. Jägerpiloten sollten allerdings wegen den zwei Türmen auf diesem Schiff vorsichtig sein: Sie sollten nicht ignoriert werden.

Der Amun wird als Bedrohung der B-Klasse für alle Kreuzer und Großkampfschiffe betrachtet. Ihnen sollte während Eskortoperationen die höchste Priorität bei der Zielauswahl gegeben werden."

421, "Hammer des Lichts"

422, "Vasudanisch-Shivanischer Hybrid. Schnell und Leistungsfähig."

423, "Die PVB Sekhmet ist ein $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Schiff, welches wie eine Fusion zwischen vasudanischer und shivanischer Technologie erscheint. Der Hammer des Lichts behauptet, dass ihr Entwurf von einer neuen Klasse an shivanischen Bombern adaptiert wurde, auf den bisher weder die GTA, noch die PVN, getroffen ist.

Vier Primärwaffenaufhängungen und drei Raketenbuchten zur Schau stellend, verpackt die Sekhmet eine gewaltige Schlagkraft. Sie sollte auf allen verbündeten Großkampfschiffen wie eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung behandelt werden."

424, "Der Jackal ist eine einfache Trainings- und Aufklärungsdrohne, welche von der PVN verwendet wird. Da der Jackal schnell und billig in Massen produziert werden konnte, dauerte es nicht lange, bis die Vasudaner ihn als Vorlage für den PVF Anubis verwendeten, einer bemannten Variante, die gut als Schwarmjäger geeignet ist.

Der Jackal ist niemals offensiv gegen die GTA verwendet worden und ist daher als Nicht-Bedrohung eingestuft."

425, "Der Scarab ist unserem Centaur sehr ähnlich und wir glauben, dass die Vasudaner den Entwurf dieses Schiffes von uns gestohlen haben. Er wird zur Wiederbewaffnung von Jägern und Bombern während des Fluges genutzt. In längeren Einsätzen können diese Schiffe den Unterschied zwischen Sieg und Niederlage bedeuten. Der Hauptunterschied zwischen diesem Schiff und dem Centaur ist, dass der Scarab unbemannt ist."

426, "Die Isis ist für einen Transporter ihrer Größe ziemlich schnell und wendig. Meistens wird sie zum Personaltransport eingesetzt, obwohl diese Klasse auch dafür bekannt ist, gelegentlich als Reparaturschiff oder Schlepper zu dienen. Sie ist durch ihre Türme gut geschützt und es ist für die PVN auch nicht unbekannt, einen Angriff auf eine befestige Stellung mit einer Staffel Isises durchzuführen."

427, "Der Bast-Frachter ist unbewaffnet und wird als eine Nicht-Bedrohung betrachtet. Wir glauben, dass sie hauptsächlich von vasudanischen Zivilisten verwendet wird, allerdings haben wir auch ein paar bei Frontlinienoperationen gesehen. Sie hat einen sehr geringen Zielwert, sollte allerdings zerstört werden, da jegliche Art von Versorgung eine Gefahr für die GTA darstellt."

428, "Der standardmäßige vasudanische Frachtbehälter unterscheidet sich nur geringfügig von unseren eigenen. Der Hauptunterschied ist, dass vasudanische Frachtbehälter auch für den Einsatz in Atmosphären, wie auch im tiefen Raum, fähig sind. Vasudaner nutzten Frachtbehälter schon, bevor wir das taten, da sie Rohmaterialien aus anderen Systemen zu ihrer eigenen kargen Welt transportieren mussten. Unser standardmäßiger Frachtbehälter hatte ihren als Vorbild, auch wenn unserer in Sachen Haltbarkeit leicht überlegen ist."

429, "Mit drei Türmen ist die Ma'at ein haariges Angriffsziel für Piloten der GTA. Allerdings ist sie langsam genug, dass sie mit genug Geduld zerstört werden kann. Wie immer gelten Versorgungsschiffe der PVN als gültige Ziele."

430, "Die $quoteVAC 4$quote-Serie an Frachtbehältern ist ähnlich, wie ihr normales Gegenstück, außer, dass sie viel mehr Panzerung besitzt. Jedoch ist dieser Behälter nicht gefährlicher als die Standardversion, womit er ohne irgendwelchen Schutz nicht mehr als ein ML-16 Köder ist."

431, "Bei der gefürchteten Satis dachte man, als man ihr das erste Mal im Kampf um Aldebaran begegnete, dass sie statt ein Frachter ein Kriegsschiff ist. Sie hat fünf Türme und eine starke Hülle, was sie ziemlich gefährlich für unerfahrene Piloten macht. Die meisten erfahrenen Piloten in der GTA wissen allerdings genug, um die Hauptschwachstelle der Satis anzugreifen: Ihre schwache Panzerung rund um die Türme. Eine Satis zu entwaffnen ist meistens der beste Weg sie zu zerstören.

Während das Kapern von Versorgungsschiffen oft ein intelligenter Plan ist, wird die Satis als gefährlich genug für eine Klasse-C-Bedrohung betrachtet. Sie sollte auch wie eine behandelt werden."

432, "Während der Kreuzer der Aten-Klasse deutlich stärker ist, als die meisten anderen vasudanischen Kriegsschiffe, kommt er als Angriffskreuzer zu kurz. Er hat nicht die Panzerung und die Feuerkraft, um GTA-Waffen standzuhalten. Mit einer Kreuzergeschwindigkeit von 25 m/s und nur sechs Waffentürmen, kann der Aten einfach nicht die Feuerkraft aufbringen, die nötig ist, um wirklich Schaden bei größeren Zielen zu verursachen. Die meisten GTA-Piloten haben gelernt die Hauptschwäche der Aten auszunutzen: Sein extrem schwaches Waffensubsystem.

Der Kreuzer der Aten-Klasse ist von der GTA als eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung eingestuft."

433, "Der PVSC Imhotep ist das standardmäßige vasudanische Forschungsschiff. Wie unsere GTSC Faustus, kann der Imhotep eine Vielzahl wissenschaftlicher Rollen ausfüllen, einschließlich Forschungen an Bord und der Durchführung von Sensorvermessungen. Ein Hauptunterschied zwischen beiden Klassen ist, dass der Imhotep eine kleine Kapselbucht trägt, die vier unabhängige Forschungskapseln beherbergt. Diese Kapseln werden häufig gestartet, um die Schiffssysteme des Imhotep zu erweitern."

434, "Diese große Sonde ist mehr eine vollausgerüstete Forschungskapsel anstatt nur eine einfache Drohne. Entworfen um mit einem Imhotep-Forschungskreuzer oder mit anderen Kapseln zusammenzuarbeiten, ist sie fähig mehrere Rollen, einschließlich Beobachtungen, Experimente und wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zu übernehmen. Es ist für eine Staffel an Kapseln möglich kleinere Missionen unabhängig einer Überwachung durchzuführen, was es dem vasudanischen Oberkommando erlaubt, die Imhoteps für die Einsätze zurückzuhalten, wo die persönliche Anwesenheit von Wissenschaftlern am nötigsten ist."

435, "Wo der Aten-Kreuzer scheiterte, übertraf der Typhon die Erwartungen bei weitem. Der Typhon ist eine unglaubliche Arbeit der Technik und ein Modell der vasudanischen Technologie. Als der erste während des Vega-Einsatzes gesichtet wurde, lachten unsere Techniker über die törichte Darstellung eines nicht-utilitaristischen Aussehens. Die anschließende Zerstörung der GTD Eisenhower und der Auslöschung der vierten Flotte änderten ihre Meinung jedoch sehr, sehr schnell. Ein Typhon sollte niemals unterschätzt werden. Dieser handhabt massig Waffen und besitzt mehr Panzerung als jeder terranische Zerstörer. Seine einzige bekannte Schwäche ist seine Turmpanzerung, welche erheblich, aber geringer als erwartet ist. In den zwei Jahren, seitdem dieses Schiff das erste Mal aufgetaucht ist, konnten wir nur zwei von ihnen zerstören.

Der Typhon wird als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung für alle Schiffe betrachtet, die sich im selben System befinden. Er sollte nicht ohne Unterstützung angegriffen werden."

436, "Die gigantische Karnak-Installationsanlage ist die Antwort der Vasudaner auf die GTI Arcadia. Diese monströse Einrichtung strotzt vor zahlreichen Türmen und kann bis zu zwei vollständige Jägergeschwader beherbergen. Ihr Hauptzweck ist es, als Konstruktions- und Wartungswerft für die vasudanischen Flotten zu dienen.

Aufgrund ihres enormen logistischen und strategischen Wertes, wird die Karnak als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung betrachtet."

437, "Der PVI Shah ist nahezu identisch zu unserem eigenen GTI Polaris, trotz der Tatsache, dass sie vollkommen unabhängig voneinander entwickelt wurden. Wie der Polaris dient der Shah als eine Konstruktions- und Wartungseinrichtung."

438, "Die vasudanische Navigationsboje ist sowohl im zivilen, wie auch militärischen Bereich weit verbreitet. Sie speichert vorberechnete Sprungkoordinaten und andere Navigationsdaten für die Nutzung von vasudanischen Konvois und ist auch in der Lage als Kommunikationsrelais zu dienen."

439, "Der Ankh ist das standardmäßige vasudanische Wachgeschütz. Er wird am meisten bei der Bewachung von Versorgungsdepots verwendet. Mit der Entwicklung des Anubis hat seine Nutzung jedoch deutlich abgenommen."

440, "Der Ra wird von den Vasudanern seit unserer ersten Begegnung mit ihnen eingesetzt. Jedes vasudanische Großkampfschiff hat einige dieser Rettungsboote."

441, "Der shivanische Dragon ist einfach der beeindruckendste Jäger, den wir bisher gesehen haben. Seine Manövrierfähigkeit ist unübertroffen und er hat auch ein paar weitere Vorteile, wie beispielsweise eine gute Höchstgeschwindigkeit, mächtige Nachbrenner und starke Schilde. Er ist der einzige shivanische Jäger, den wir aus nächster Nähe studieren konnten und wir haben von ihm viel über die shivanische Technik gelernt.

Es scheint, als seien die Schildsysteme der Shivaner extrem stark, allerdings sind ihre Hüllen deutlich schwächer als unsere. Außerdem verlassen sie sich deutlich mehr auf ihre Primär- anstatt Sekundärwaffen, was durch die kleine Raketenzuladung des Dragons bewiesen wird.

Die GTA betrachtet den Dragon als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung."

442, "Gekaperter shivanischer Jäger, der für terranische Piloten angepasst wurde."

443, "Der shivanische Dragon ist einfach der beeindruckendste Jäger, den wir bisher gesehen haben. Seine Manövrierfähigkeit ist unübertroffen und er hat auch ein paar weitere Vorteile, wie beispielsweise eine gute Höchstgeschwindigkeit, mächtige Nachbrenner und starke Schilde. Er ist der einzige shivanische Jäger, den wir aus nächster Nähe studieren konnten und wir haben von ihm viel über die shivanische Technik gelernt.

Es scheint, als seien die Schildsysteme der Shivaner extrem stark, allerdings sind ihre Hüllen deutlich schwächer als unsere. Außerdem verlassen sie sich deutlich mehr auf ihre Primär- anstatt Sekundärwaffen, was durch die kleine Raketenzuladung des Dragons bewiesen wird."

444, "Der Basilisk scheint ein schwerer shivanischer Angriffsjäger zu sein. Er ist nicht so Manövrierfähig wie andere shivanische Jäger, verpackt allerdings eine starke Schlagkraft und ist gegen unsere Waffen sehr widerstandsfähig. Sie werden am häufigsten bei Angriffen auf unsere Konvois und Transporter verwendet.

Der Basilisk sollte wie eine Klasse-C-Bedrohung behandelt werden."

445, "Wir glauben, dass der Manticore ein shivanischer Abfänger ist. Er hat eine sehr hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit, wie auch eine Manövrierfähigkeit ziemlich gut ist. Allerdings ist sein Schildsystem nicht stark genug, um sehr lange konstantem Waffenfeuer zu widerstehen, was uns zu der Überzeugung bringt, dass der Haupteinsatzzweck des Manticores die Zerstörung gegnerischer Bomber ist.

Der Manticore ist als eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung eingestuft."

446, "Wir dachten ursprünglich, dass der Scorpion der beste Jäger der Shivaner ist. Allerdings gehen wir mittlerweile davon aus, dass der Scorpion nicht mehr ist, als ein shivanisches Aufklärungsschiff. Ihre blanke Anzahl und augenscheinliche Unwichtigkeit in den shivanischen Kriegsbemühungen brachten uns zu dieser Überzeugung. Unabhängig seines Einsatzzweckes ist der Scorpion extrem manövrierfähig, schnell und schwer zu zerstören. Ebenso kann er Schäden verursachen, die mit unseren Raumüberlegenheitsjägern vergleichbar sind.

Im Falle einer Begegnung mit Scorpions, sollten sie als Klasse-C-Bedrohung betrachtet werden."

447, "Die erste Begegnung mit dem SF Gorgon fand durch die GTD Saratoga im Ikeya-System statt. Wir sind nicht sicher, ob es sich um einen neuen shivanischen Entwurf handelt oder die Shivaner diese spezielle Schiffsklasse einfach für den Großteil des Krieges zurückgehalten haben. Das ungewöhnliche Aussehen des Schiffes ermöglicht ihm nicht nur eine außergewöhnliche Manövrierfähigkeit, sondern auch das Erzeugen eines extrem mächtigen Schildes. Bisher wurden diese Schiffe nur als Leitung von kleineren Jägerstaffeln gesichtet, allerdings gibt es auch Berichte über ganze Gorgon-Staffeln innerhalb größerer Streitkräfte.

Ansonsten ist wenig über den Gorgon bekannt. Er sollte als eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung betrachtet werden, wenn er als Staffelleiter agiert, allerdings sollte eine ganze Staffel an Gorgons auf allen verbündeten Schiffen wie eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung behandelt werden."

448, "Der Shaitan-Bomber ist unseren eigenen Bombern nur leicht überlegen - sein Schild ist besser, aber seine Kapazität scheint deutlich schlechter zu sein. Möglicherweise waren die Shivaner davon überzeugt, dass sie eine Zuladung für nur einen Anflug benötigen, um ein Ziel zu zerstören.

Wir betrachten den Shaitan als eine Klasse-C-Bedrohung."

449, "Der Bomber der Nephilim-Klasse ist das fremdartigste der shivanischen Schiffe. Wir sind uns, nach wie vor, nicht sicher wieso die Shivaner diese seltsame Form für ihr wohl stärkstes Angriffsschiff gewählt haben. Mit vier Primärkanonen und zwei Türmen, wie auch einer massiven Zuladung, ist der Nephilim jedoch unbestreitbar eine ernsthafte Gefahr für die GTA. Wir haben bereits zwei Zerstörer der Orion-Klasse an Staffeln mit Nephilims verloren. Wenn wir nicht bald eine Schwäche herausfinden, werden wir wahrscheinlich zwei weitere verlieren.

Der Nephilim wird als Klasse-A-Bedrohung für GTA-Zerstörer und -Kreuzer bezeichnet. In unbewohnten Systemen sollte er als eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung betrachtet werden."

450, "Der neue Bomber der Seraphim-Klasse ist die neueste Bedrohung der Shivaner. Sie ist dreimal so groß wie ein Nephilim und trägt auch eine Zuladung, dessen Größe bis zu 150% der einer Nephilim entspricht. Mit starken Hüllen und einem nahezu undurchdringlichen Schildsystem ist die Seraphim schlicht der gefährlichste Bomber, dem wir bisher begegnet sind.

Die Seraphim wird als Klasse-A-Bedrohung für GTA-Zerstörer und -Kreuzer bezeichnet. In unbewohnten Systemen sollte sie als eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung betrachtet werden."

451, "Die SB Nahema wurde, soweit wir feststellen können, bisher weder von GTA- noch von PVN-Streitkräften angetroffen. Die geringen Informationen die wir über diesen Bomber haben, stammen aus unseren Verhören von HoL-Gefangenen und sind durch den GTI als streng geheim eingestuft. Was wir wissen ist, dass die Nahema die Basis ist, auf dem der HoL den PVB Sekhmet, ihr vasudanisch-shivanischer Hybridbomberprototyp, konstruierte. Wie es dem HoL überhaupt gelang Scans der Nahema zu erhalten, ist nicht bekannt."

452, "Der Azrael ist sehr wahrscheinlich ein shivanischer Transporter. Obwohl wir uns über seine Verwendung nicht vollkommen sicher sind, wissen wir, dass er viele Shivaner beherbergen kann. Er ist nicht sehr stark gepanzert und seine Bewaffnung ist auch nicht sehr stark. Das macht den Azrael zum gebräuchlichsten Ziel für Kaperungsversuche."

453, "Der Mephisto-Frachter verhält sich ähnlich wie einer von unseren, ist allerdings deutlich mächtiger und gefährlicher. Über diese Schiffsklasse sind nur wenig Daten verfügbar."

454, "Wir glauben, dass die Shivaner Frachtbehälter wie diesen als Lagerplatz verwenden. Wir haben bisher noch keinen Shivaner gesehen, der auf einem Planeten landet. Dies bringt uns zu der Überzeugung, dass die Shivaner planen alle ihre Materialien und Ressourcen im tiefen Raum zu behalten."

455, "Über den Asmodeus-Frachter gibt es fast keine Daten. Wir sind uns nur darüber bewusst, dass er eine starke Hülle und vier Türme hat. Alle weiteren Daten über dieses Schiff sollten sofort dem terranischen Geheimdienst überbracht werden."

456, "Was wir als SAC 2 titulieren, ist einfach eine besser gepanzerte Form des standardmäßigen shivanischen Frachtbehälters. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass hier die Shivaner ihre wertvolleren Vorräte lagern. SAC 2s sollten bei jeder Gelegenheit gekapert oder zerstört werden."

457, "Der Cain ist der mit Abstand gebräuchlichste Kreuzer in der shivanischen Flotte. Er ist auch der schwächste. Allerdings sollte der Cain nicht unterschätzt werden. Er besitzt viele Türme, wie auch ein Gruppensprengkopfverteidigungsmechanismus. Als ein Stoßkreuzer taucht der Cain meistens in Angriffen gegen GTA- oder PVN-Großkampfschiffen und -Kreuzern auf. In diesen Fällen sollte er sofort zerstört werden. Die Hauptschwachstelle des Cain scheinen seine ungeschützten Türme zu sein. Die meisten der Türme auf einem Cain können mit nur geringem Schaden zerstört werden.

Der Cain ist eine Klasse-B-Bedrohung."

458, "Obwohl deutlich seltener als ihr Gegenstück, dem Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse, ist die Lilith eine der grausamsten Kreuzer, wo wir das Pech einer Bekämpfung hatten. Sie hat extrem starke Waffensysteme, wie auch eine extrem dicke Panzerung, die unsere Kanonen kaum durchdringen können. Im Eins-gegen-Eins kann die Lilith leicht jeden unserer Kreuzer zerstören. Aus diesem Grund sollten sie als Primärziel für alle Bombergeschwader in der GTA gelten.

Die Lilith sollte als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung für alle Schiffe betrachtet werden, die ihr begegnen."

459, "Obwohl der Zerstörer der Demon-Klasse schlicht eins der mächtigsten Schiffe ist, welches wir je gesehen haben, ist es weder das Größte noch das Mächtigste innerhalb der shivanischen Armada. Allerdings ist er durch seine Fülle an Raketentürmen und ganzen zwei Jägergeschwadern noch immer ziemlich gefährlich. Es wird vorgeschlagen, dass diese Großkampfschiffe von Bombern zerstört werden, da alle Kreuzer, die versucht haben einen Demon anzugreifen, zerstört wurden.

Der Demon ist eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung in jedem verbündeten System."

460, "Die Lucifer ist die größte Gefahr für das Überleben der GTA, der PVN wie auch für die gesamte terranische und vasudanische Rasse. Er handhabt drei mächtige Flusskanonen, welche eines unserer Großkampfschiffe mit nur wenigen Treffern zerstören kann. Es wurde darüber hinaus auch beobachtet, wie die gleichen Kanonen kolonisierte Welten bombardiert haben. Mit vier ganzen Jägergeschwadern und einer riesigen Ansammlung an Verteidigungstürmen, wäre die Lucifer bereits in einer normalen Situation extrem schwer zu zerstören. Die Tatsache, dass er durch ein Hüllenschildsystem geschützt ist, welches vollkommen undurchlässig für jegliche Art von kinetischen oder Plasmaschaden ist, machen es unmöglich, ihn zu zerstören. Wir müssen einen Weg finden, diese Schildtechnologie zu brechen. Es ist zu hoffen, dass bald eine Lösung gefunden wird.

Unter der Annahme, dass eine Lösung gefunden wird, waren wir in der Lage genügend Daten über die Lucifer zu sammeln, um sie zu zerstören. In einer Aufklärungsmission konnten wir feststellen, dass die Lucifer von fünf Reaktoren angetrieben wird, die über seiner Oberfläche verteilt sind. Wenn diese Reaktoren innerhalb kürzester Zeit zerstört werden, kann die Lucifer gestoppt werden. Wenn wir die Lucifer nicht stoppen können, erwarten wir nicht, dass wir in der Lage sein werden, die Shivaner zu besiegen.

Wir wissen nicht ob es mehr als einen Zerstörer der Lucifier-Klasse gibt. Jedoch sollten alle, die existieren, als eine Gefahr betrachtet werden, die größer ist, als eine Klasse-A-Bedrohung."

461, "Wir glauben, dass es der einzige Zweck des Tridents ist, shivanische Reparatur- und Versorgungsdepots zu bewachen. Er ist nicht zu stark, kann aber in größerer Anzahl gefährlich werden."

462, "Terraner"

463, "Terraner entstammen dem dritten Planeten im Sol-System, alternativ bekannt als Terra oder Erde. Terraner sind körperlich relativ schwach, sind aber sehr intelligent und vielseitig. Diese Kombination aus Intelligenz und Vielseitigkeit hat es den Terranern ermöglicht, sich von einem Stammes- und nomadischen Primaten, nicht ganz unähnlich ihrer Vorfahren, zu einer weltraumreisenden Rasse zu entwickeln.

Die terranische Zivilisation entwickelte sich bis zum Punkt relativ stabiler Nationalstaaten. Mit der Raumfahrt, entwickelte sich der Nationalstaat zu einem Weltstaat und die terranische Rasse förderte ihr Wachstum auf materiellem, wie auch immateriellem, philosophischen Wegen. Mit der Zeit führte der Weltstaat zu einem Intersystemstaat, welcher wiederum zur Galaktisch Terranischen Allianz, einem Galaktischen Staat führte.

Bisher haben die Terraner erfolgreich zwölf Welten außerhalb des Sol-Systems kolonisiert. Außenposten wurden auf fünfzehn weiteren Planeten oder Monden in der bekannten Galaxis errichtet. Wenn die Vergangenheit ein Indikator für zukünftige Entwicklungen ist, wird die geschlossene Expansionspolitik der Allianz sowohl politisch, wie auch wirtschaftlich, zugutekommen."

464, "Vasudaner entstammen dem vierten Planeten des Vasuda-Systems, der einzige Planet in diesem System, welcher Lebensfähig ist. Ihr Heimatplanet, auch bekannt als Vasuda Prime, ist eine relativ feindselige Welt. Beide Zwillingskontinente auf Vasuda Prime bestehen fast ausschließlich aus Wüste und das meiste Wasser an der Oberfläche ist, selbst für vasudanische Ansprüche, ungenießbar. Um sich diesen Umgebungen anzupassen, entwickelten sich die Vasudaner ziemlich schnell.

Die vasudanische Gesellschaft ist komplex und für Außenstehende, die ihre Kultur ignorieren, mit zahlreichen Gefahren gespickt. Vasudaner haben eine Vielzahl an sozialen Prüfungen und Protokolle, wie beispielsweise die $quoteKonversation$quote. Eine terranische Misshandlung von der $quoteKonversation$quote wird als eine der Hauptursachen für den terranisch-vasudanischen Krieg gesehen. Die vasudanische Regierung ist von Natur aus parlamentarisch, wird aber von der imperialen Familie und den Botschaftern geleitet, welche quasi-königlich zwischen dem Parlament und dem Imperium stehen.

Die vasudanische Weltraumerforschung wurde hauptsächlich durch die Notwendigkeit angetrieben, Planeten zu finden, welche in der Lage sind, ihre Rasse zu erhalten. Da die Ressourcen auf Vasuda Prime abgenommen haben, hat sich der Antrieb unter den Vasudanern andere Welten zu kolonisieren in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten verstärkt."

465, "Trotz der Informationen, die wir erhalten konnten, bleiben die Shivaner, sowohl für Terraner als auch Vasudaner, auf mehreren Ebenen ein Rätsel. Ihr Ursprung und Ihr Ziel bleibt unbekannt. Während viele eine mögliche Erklärung dafür geboten haben, warum die Shivaner darauf fokussiert zu sein scheinen, alle anderen empfindungsfähigen Rassen zu zerstören, wissen wir immer noch nicht, warum sie so auf den Gesamt-Xenozid aus sind.

Shivaner haben mehrere Augen, wobei manche die Funktion von Facettenaugen zu übernehmen scheinen, ganz so ähnlich wie bei Varianten von Insekten. Shivaner haben auch fünf Beine, womit sie gleichermaßen auf dem Boden, wie auch an der Decke laufen können. Es wird vermutet, dass Shivaner ihren evolutionären Prozess in einer Null-Gravitation-Umgebung durchlaufen haben. Jedes shivanische Bein endet in einer sehr starken Kralle, die in der Lage ist, selbst die stärksten bekanntesten Legierungen zu zerquetschen. Teile ihres Brustkorbs scheinen als Fächer zu dienen, wie solche, die man an Weltraumanzügen finden kann. Es liegt nahe, dass das, was wir gesehen haben entweder Roboter oder organische Kreaturen in einer Art Exo-Skelett gewesen sind. Allerdings haben wir, gegenwärtig, keinen Grund eine dieser Annahmen zu unterstützen.

Sehr wahrscheinlich werden wir nichts Weiteres über die shivanische Rasse erfahren, solange es uns nicht gelingt einen Shivaner gefangen zu nehmen, um ihn zu studieren."

507, "Argonlaserwaffe. Verwendet transparente keramische Technologie, um ein optisches System zu schaffen, welches unter Kampfbedingungen extrem haltbar und stabil ist.  Bietet einen angemessenen zerstörerischen Schaden auf der Hülle gegnerischer Ziele, indem molekulare Verbindungen am Zielgebiet verdampft, wie auch die molekularen Verbindungen über die gesamte Hülle verteilt destabilisiert werden.

Die GTA gibt den ML-16 an alle Jäger und Bomber im Einsatz aus."

508, "PVW VLL-9"

509, "Neonlaserwaffe. Verwendet versilberte Optik, um ein einheitliches Paket an Energie zu erzeugen, welches unter Kampfbedingungen extrem zuverlässig ist. Das Energiepaket wird einem Plasmablitz eingeflößt, welcher mit einer Geschwindigkeit von zwei Schuss pro Sekunde abgefeuert wird. Die hochtemperierte Masse verdampft die meisten Materialien beim Aufprall. Längere Anwendung verursacht den Ausfall der Materialintegrität, wie auch Hüllenbrüche.

Standardausgabe an vasudanische Leutnants. Diese billige, in Massen produzierte Laserkanone, ist in ihrer Leistung ähnlich der ML-16, ist aber leicht wirksamer gegen isolierte Subsysteme."

512, "Ein gasfokussierter Kryptonlaser. Wenn sich das Schiff im Flug befindet, rotiert die Kammer der GTW-41 in einer konstanten Geschwindigkeit. Eine kleine Menge an Stickstoffdioxid (NO2) wird 0,05 ms vor der Abstrahlung des Laserlichts in die Kammer injiziert. Die Rotation des Stickstoffdioxids in der Kammer fokussiert den Laserimpuls in einen Zustand, der nur zu einem Prozent zerstreut ist. Nachdem der Laserimpuls von der Kammer in den Weltraum abgestrahlt wurde, stößt die Kammer das Stickstoffdioxid in den Weltraum aus, wodurch auch ionisierte Moleküle und Feuchtigkeit ausgestoßen werden. Dieser Prozess wiederholt sich bei jedem folgenden Ladungsstoß an Laserenergie. Da dieser Laser nicht sehr streut, ist er als zerstörerische- nicht, jedoch sehr wohl als taktische Waffe effektiv. Die Disruptor-Kanone ist am besten geeignet und wird auch dafür verwendet, um Subsysteme von gegnerischen Schiffen permanent auszuschalten.

Die Disruptor sollte bei allen Kaperungsoperationen genutzt werden, um das Risiko der Zerstörung des Ziels zu minimieren."

Die dynamische Magnetisierung des gestreuten Laserimpulses reagiert auf die Rückmeldungen der Zielerfassungssensoren. Verbesserte gasbasierte Beschleunigungstechnologie führt zu einer höheren Projektilgeschwindigkeit. Da dieser Laser kaum streut, ist er als zerstörerische- nicht, jedoch sehr wohl als taktische Waffe effektiv. Am besten geeignet und wird auch dafür verwendet, um Subsysteme von gegnerischen Schiffen permanent auszuschalten.

Die Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun ist ein vasudanischer Nachbau der GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor. Gemeinsam mit dem Prometheus Retrofit wird sie als Teil einer neuen Generation an standardausgegebener Bewaffnung in die Massenproduktion gedrängt, die die ML-16- und Disruptor-Kanonen ersetzen sollen, die seit dem Krieg zwischen unseren beiden Rassen vor zehn Jahren verwendet werden. Da sie für die Kriegsschiffe der nächsten Generation, die gegenwärtig in Entwicklung sind, optimiert ist, könnten ältere Jäger möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, mit den Energievoraussetzungen Schritt zu halten."

Projektilwaffe
Geringer Schildschaden"

521, "Ein schnellfeuerndes computergesteuertes Radar- und Geschützsystem, das imstande ist, über 4500 Schuss pro Minute abzufeuern. Wird hauptsächlich in Nahverteidigungssituationen eingesetzt. Verwendet Kreislaufradartechnologie, um ein Ziel zu lokalisieren, zu identifizieren und ein Strom von sehr zerstörerischen 45mm Projektile zum Ziel zu lenken.

Mit dem Aufkommen der Schildtechnologie, wird die Avenger gegenüber der ML-16 in jedem Schiff bevorzugt, die sie tragen kann. Ihr zusätzlicher Schaden gegen Hüllen machen sie zu einem der besten Waffen gegen Kreuzer. Sie hat sich auch als sehr effektiv gegen vasudanische Jäger erwiesen. Ihre minderwertigen Anti-Schild Fähigkeiten machen sie allerdings zu einer schlechten Wahl für den Nahkampf gegen Shivaner, wenn auch zu einer besseren, als die ML-16."

523, "Spezialausgabe
Geringer Energieverbrauch
Kinetische Waffe
Mäßiger Schildschaden"

524, "Ein schnellfeuernder, Niedrigenergie, keramik-optisch fokussierter Kryptonlaser. Verwendet in taktischen Situationen, um Gegner abzulenken oder sie zu ihrer Zerstörung durch andere verbündete Jäger zu treiben. Wird diese Waffe über einen längeren Zeitraum in einem Raumkampf verwendet, kann sie einen gegnerischen Jäger vernichten, das sollte allerdings nur als letztes Mittel betrachtet werden.

Die schnelle Feuerrate und hohe Masse des Flail ist großartig dafür geeignet, die Geschwindigkeitsrichtung eines gegnerischen Jägers oder Bombers zu verändern. Gemessen am Schaden pro Sekunde, ist es gegen Schilde leicht wirksamer, als die Avenger. Sein niedriger Energieverbrauch macht sie für längere Gefechte nützlich. Es sollte beachtet werden, dass der Wechsel zu einer anderen Waffe empfohlen wird, sobald die Schilde des Gegners ausgeschaltet wurden."

527, "Benannt nach dem Titanen, der der Menschheit das Feuer gab, ist die Prometheus eine laserbasierende Waffe. Ein fortschrittliches Radar- und Röntgenverfolgungssystem erfassen das Ziel und ermitteln seine Materialstruktur. Ein Argonlaser wird durch eine transparente keramische Optik fokussiert. Der Laser wird, außerhalb der Phase, in einer zerstörerischen Frequenz für die Materialstruktur des Ziels generiert. Nicht mehr als 0,02 ms benötigt die Ausstrahlung nach der Zielerfassung und Aktivierung durch den Piloten, weswegen die Prometheus als eines der wirksamsten Abschreckungsmittel für gegnerische Angriffe der GTA steht, wie auch als eine effektive Form der Verteidigung für GTA-Piloten und als ein haltbares, portables und höchst zerstörerisches Offensivwerkzeug.

Die Prometheus arbeitet am besten gegen Zielhüllen. Gegen Schilde erreicht sie allerdings nur eine mittelmäßige Leistung. Ihre langsame Geschwindigkeit und ihr hoher Energieverbrauch arbeiten ebenfalls gegen sie. Der Hauptvorteil der Prometheus ist jedoch, dass sie auf nahezu jeden Jäger der GTA bestückt werden kann."

528, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

529, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

530, "Entworfen als eine verbesserte Spezialausgabe zur normalen Prometheus, behält die Prometheus A die Kompatibilität des Originals, während eine höhere Feuerrate und Geschossgeschwindigkeit erreicht wird. Diese Fortschritte gehen auf Kosten einer leichten Steigerung des Energieverbrauchs, wobei viele Piloten das Gefühl haben, dass dieser Kompromiss einen Vorteil bringt. Der Einsatz dieser Waffe ist gegenwärtig auf GTI-Piloten mit speziell autorisierten Missionen beschränkt."

Mit der gekappten Verbindung zur Erde, war es der GTA nicht möglich genügend Mengen an Argon, welches für das Energiegeneratormodul der Prometheus nötig ist, zu erlangen, um die Herstellung der Standard-Prometheus fortzuführen. GTA-Ingenieure veränderten den originalen Entwurf, um die verbesserten elektromagnetische Mechanismen der Banshee zu integrieren. Die Technologie wurde jedoch nicht perfektioniert, weshalb die Prometheus R an einem langen Nachladezyklus und hohen Energievoraussetzungen leidet."

Sehr hoher Energieverbrauch
Extremer Schildschaden"

537, "Eine elektromagnetische Waffe. Sendet schnelle Impulse von außergewöhnlicher starker elektromagnetischer Energie aus, welche für eine Explosion von 1,63 x 10^5 Joule sorgt, die jede bekannte Schildtechnologie durchbricht und einen dramatischen Schneideeffekt produziert, welcher schnell das Material des Zielschiffes zerstört. Benannt nach dem Fakt, dass der Impuls innerhalb von Atmosphären eine atmosphärische Turbulenz verursacht, welche einem quasi-menschlichen Schrei bei 180 dB ähnlich ist. Verbraucht eine ungeheuerliche Menge der verfügbaren Schiffsenergie. Sie wurde bereits von vielen Assen und Testpiloten der GTA als Gnadenstoß verwendet, auch wenn die Nutzung dieser extrem leistungsstarken Offensivwaffe offiziell von der GTA als mangelnde Fairness betrachtet wird.

Die eindrucksvollen Anti-Schild Fähigkeiten der Banshee, machen sie zur Waffe der Wahl gegen die Shivaner. Die Haupteinschränkung dieser Waffe ist die geringe Waffenkompatibilität."

538, "GTW-65 Railgun"

539, "Prototyp
Hochgeschwindigkeitswaffe
Langer Nachladezyklus"

540, "Eine Prototyp-Kanone des GTI. Die Railgun wurde ursprünglich als ein Versuch entwickelt, die Schilde des Lucifer-Superzerstörers zu durchdringen. Diese Waffe verwendet eine Serie von Elektromagneten, welche mit einer Präzision im Millisekundenbereich abgefeuert werden und gehäuselose Urangeschosse auf extreme Geschwindigkeiten beschleunigt. Während ihre Reichweite, Genauigkeit und Einschlagskraft die höchste im terranischen Arsenal ist, ist der Schildschaden gering und die Waffe leidet an einem verlängerten Nachladezyklus. Obwohl die Railgun genau genommen eine ballistische Waffe ist, sind die Geschosse extrem klein und daher ist aus taktischen Zwecken, die Munition praktisch unbegrenzt."

541, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

553, "Geeignet für alle Raumschlachten, sowohl Defensiv, wie auch Offensiv. Mittlere Sprengkraft mit 16,5 Kilotonnen. Infrarot-Verfolgung und Halbintelligente Zielerfassung. Der Pilot wählt das gewünschte Ziel und die MX-50 verfolgt das gewählte Ziel auf Basis der Hitzeausstrahlung des Antriebs, der Waffenbuchten und des Cockpits des Zielschiffes. Die MX-50 wird immer ein Ziel angreifen, welches vom Bordcomputer eines jeden GTA-Kampfschiffes als feindlich bestimmt wurde, was eine höhere Abschussrate garantiert, sollte sich der Pilot in einer hitzigen Gefechtssituation befinden, in der präzises Zielen schwierig ist.

Frühe Experimente mit energiebasierten Verteidigungen, wie die Abweiserantennen in Ross 128, haben gezeigt, dass diese Waffe gegen alle, außer stahlbasierten, Zielen extrem schwach ist."

559, "Kleine, schnelle, ungelenkte Raketen. In Schwärmen abgefeuert. Geringe Genauigkeit wird durch eine hohe Geschwindigkeit und der Immunität gegen elektronische Gegenmaßnahmen ausgeglichen. Sehr geringe Sprengkraft mit zwei Kilotonnen.

Ein vasudanischer Raketenentwurf, welcher die $quoteZwillingsfeuer$quote-Technik einsetzt. Sie ist eine gute Wahl für Nahkämpfe und Frachterangriffe, wo Verfolgung kein Thema ist. Der Zwillingsfeuerentwurf erhöht die Sprengkraft pro Salve und auch das Schadenspotenzial bei überfallartigen Angriffen. Die GTA entwickelt gerade, basierend auf der Fang, ihre eigene Schwarmrakete."

562, "Aspektsuchend. Laserverfolgung spürt reflektierte Energie vom primären Waffensystem des Ziels auf, erhöht damit die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Abschusses mit nur einem Treffer. Mittlere Sprengkraft mit 18,5 Kilotonnen. Rakete ist dafür entworfen, verstärkte Hüllen zu durchschlagen, womit sie sich das Ziel sichert, bevor sie mit einer Verzögerung von 15 Millisekunden detoniert.

Dies ist der standardausgegebene Jägerkiller der GTA. Entworfen um Jäger mit minimalen Ärger auszuschalten, ist das einzige was benötigt wird, eine einfache Aufschaltung, um die Aufmerksamkeit des Feindes zu erhalten. Kurze Aufschaltungszeit, gute Geschwindigkeit und vernünftige Sprengkraft machen sie zur besten Rakete gegen alle, außer den stärksten, Schiffe. Ihre Wirksamkeit gegen große Ziele ist jedoch geringer als ein einfacher Laserangriff, was sie hauptsächlich zur Schiff-zu-Schiff-Rakete macht."

Integrierte halbintelligente Verfolgung. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit von einem Abschuss mit einer Salve erreicht im Durchschnitt keine 60%. Entworfen als Offensivversion der Fury.

Als eine $quoteSchwarm$quote-basierende Waffe, kann diese Rakete einen schildlosen Jäger ohne weitere Probleme zerstören. Sein Vier-Raketen-System garantiert fast immer ein oder zwei Treffer und hat eine ganz erstaunliche Geschwindigkeit. Doppelt so stark gegen nackte Hüllen."

Eine der besten aspektsuchenden Raketen, die je entwickelt wurde. Viele Jägerpiloten innerhalb der GTA, betrachten die Phoenix V als die Waffe der Wahl gegen hochwertige, stark verteidigte Ziele.

Der Bomberkiller Nummer Eins in unserem Arsenal. Dies ist die schädlichste Einzelrakete, welche auf einem Jäger bestückt werden kann. Die längere Aufschaltzeit und langsamere Geschwindigkeit machen sie mehr zu einem Sprengkopf gegen Bomber anstatt zur Nahkampfwaffe. Ihr zusätzlicher Schaden gegen Schilde macht sie besonders gegen shivanische Bomber nützlich."

Geringe Sprengkraft mit neun Kilotonnen, welche sowohl konventionelle Sprengsätze, wie auch einen lokalen Energiestoß, aufgrund des Aufpralls auf das Laser-Antriebssystem der Rakete, verbindet. Entworfen um vorübergehend Subsysteme auf feindlichen Zielen zu deaktivieren.

Die Disruptor-Rakete ist so entworfen, dass sie vorübergehend einen Kreuzer oder Zerstörer daran hindert, seine Lasertürme abzufeuern. Pro abgefeuerte Rakete hält die Wirkung für etwa 10 Sekunden an, so dass das vorübergehende Deaktivieren eines Kreuzers zur Unterdrückung dienen soll, bis dieser zerstört wurde oder das Schiff, was versucht dem Kreuzer auszuweichen, außer Reichweite ist. Nur ein paar Schiffe können diese Rakete tragen, die sehr rar sind und weshalb eine richtige Verwendung wichtig ist."

572, "PVM-2 Havoc"

573, "Spezialausgabe

574, "Havocs waren während des 14-jährigen Krieges eine Spezialausgabe für vasudanische Asse. Sie hält den Titel für die erste Rakete, welche die Fernzündungstechnik verwendete, die später in der Cluster Bomb zum Einsatz kam. Splitter und Scherben eines nicht-explosiven Schrapnells umgeben den explosiven Kern, welcher Schilde und Panzerung des Ziels abträgt. Der Schaden an Subsystemen ist aufgrund seiner oberflächlichen Beschädigung minimal. Mit der Entwicklung der Schildtechnologie wird die Havoc jetzt gegen ungeschützte Frachtformationen und ähnliches eingesetzt."

Wenn die Distanz zum Ziel weniger als 100 m oder die Zeit bis zum Einschlag weniger als zwei Sekunden beträgt, lenken die Bömbchen die Rakete zu den verwundbarsten Teilen des Schiffes, dessen Teile der Rakete zugewandt sind. Die Bömbchen trennen sich dann von der Antriebseinheit und formen eine Spähre. Die Trägheit trägt die Bömbchen weiter in Richtung des Ziels. Die Antriebseinheit fliegt dem Ziel weiterhin entgegen. Wenn die Rakete das Ziel trifft oder 1,5 Sekunden nachdem sie das Ziel hätte treffen sollen, explodieren die Bömbchen. Die Form einer Sphäre der Bömbchen hilft dabei, sicher zu stellen, dass ein einheitlicher Schaden über eine bestimmte Flache, rund um das Ziel, entsteht. Die spährische Form stellt auch sicher, dass sich das Ziel nicht wirksam der Sprengung entziehen kann, womit das Ziel an eine bestimmte Fläche im Raum $quotefestgenagelt$quote wird. Kann auch Ungelenkt agieren. Mittlere Sprengkraft mit 15 Kilotonnen pro Bömbchen. Sehr geringe Sprengkraft, mit 2 Kilotonnen, der Rakete.

Die Bomberpiloten, die diese Waffe testeten, gaben ihr den Spitznamen $quoteErdschüttler$quote. Sie ist die beste Verteidigung für Bomber gegen Jäger. Die Synaptic kann eine Menge Schaden an einer Menge Schiffe zur gleichen Zeit anrichten."

579, "Standardausgabe
Taktische Rakete"

580, "Als zweite Generation der Synaptic, wurde dieser, vom GTI entwickelte, Sprengkopf für Angriffe auf ganze Staffeln an gegnerischen Schiffen entworfen.

Nach Erreichen des Ziels, zersplittert der primäre Sprengkopf in mehrere sekundäre Sprengköpfe, welche innerhalb von einer Sekunde explodieren. Die Detonationen produzieren ein großes Explosionsfeld, was die Cluster Bomb, übersetzt Streubombe, damit höchst wirksam gegen Jägerformationen macht."

581, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

582, "Standardausgabe
Taktische Rakete
Zerstört Subsysteme"

583, "Hitzesuchend. Laserverfolgung ähnlich der Interceptor. Rakete ist durch ein kleines Schildsystem geschützt, was ihr einen höheren Erfolg bei der Ablieferung der Raketenlast in Nahkampfsituationen und intensiven Feuergefechten ermöglicht. Schnell, aber geringe Manövrierfähigkeit im Vergleich zu anderen Raketen vergleichbarer Größe. Geringe Manövrierfähigkeit aufgrund ihrer Sprengkraft von 60 Kilotonnen und des eingebauten Schildsystems.

Mit der Fähigkeit, die meisten Subsysteme mit nur einem Treffer auszuschalten und dem einfachen Abschuss, wie bei einer MX-50, ist die Stiletto die beste, von der GTA entwickelte, Bombe zum Deaktivieren von Schiffen. Wirksam gegen Türme, Antriebe und jedem anderen Subsystem ist die Stiletto ein wertvolles Gut im Arsenal eines Bombers. Jedoch ist sie langsam, unkontrollierbar und verursacht keinen wirklichen Hüllenschaden."

Elektromagnetische Impulswaffe
Anti-Bomber-Waffe"

586, "Beim Aufprall deaktiviert die EM Pulse, übersetzt Elektromagnetischer Impuls, vorübergehend die elektronischen Systeme des Zielschiffes. Dies macht dem Zielschiff unmöglich, Ziele zu verfolgen, zu kommunizieren oder eine Zielaufschaltung für Raketen zu erhalten. Das hat zahlreiche taktische Anwendungen. Zum Beispiel verhindert ein direkter Treffer der EM Pulse das Abfeuern von aspektsuchenden Sprengköpfen von Bombern für mehrere Sekunden. Sobald das EMP-Feld abgeklungen ist, müssen sie sich erst die Zeit für eine erneute Zielaufschaltung nehmen, was wertvolle Zeit bedeutet."

Diese Antimateriewaffen können deutlich mehr Schaden als unsere $quotePhoenix V$quote-Raketen verursachen, sind allerdings langsamer als normale Weltraumbomben. Der Barracuda wird von den Vasudanern für Angriffe auf Kreuzer und stationären Installationsanlagen bevorzugt. Osiris-Bomber feuern diese Waffen für gewöhnlich in Paaren ab, um Türme auf Großkampfschiffen auszuschalten. Das Zielsystem des Barracuda ist anfällig für Störungen und eine gewöhnliche Feldmodifikation kann das Zielaufschaltungssystem komplett umgehen, was auch ungelenkte Abschüsse erlaubt."

Wegen der Instabilität von Antimaterie, dürfen nicht mehr als zehn auf einem GTA-Bomber getragen werden, es sei denn, der Pilot hat eine spezielle Erlaubnis des zuständigen Organs.

Die Tsunami ist die terranische Standardbombe geworden, wenn es darum geht große Ziele auszuschalten. Ihre kurze Lebensspanne setzt voraus, dass man innerhalb 1500 Meter zum Ziel gelangt, bevor sie abgeschickt wird. Und weil sie zum Abfeuern eine Aufschaltung benötigt, braucht es auch einen tapferen Piloten, der lange genug geradeaus fliegt, um eine von ihnen fliegen zu lassen. Ein paar Tsunamis schalten fast alle Schiffe aus, außer Zerstörer. Der Antimaterie-Sprengkopf umspült Schilde, solange man sich nicht zu nah am Zentrum der Sprengung befindet, hat ein Jäger und Bomber eine gute Chance, die Detonation zu überleben."

Erhebliche Zerstörungsfähigkeit, ist nicht für die taktische Zerstörung von Subsystemen bestimmt. Höchster Schaden aller GTA-Bomben dieser Größe. Ein einzelner Bomber mit einer Ladung GTM-X1 hat ein Zwei-Drittel größeres Schadenspotenzial als einer mit einer Ladung GTM-N1. Einstufiger flüssiger Treibstoffraketenbeschleuniger. Kleinster Wenderadius und größere Lineargeschwindigkeit aller GTA-Bomben. Höchstwirksamer Entwurf für erweiterte Waffenlebensdauer.

Die Serkr ist ein ertragreicher Sprengkopf, welcher als Teil eines streng geheimen experimentellen Waffenprogrammes des GTI, entwickelt wurde. Rein für den Hüllenschaden geopferte Anti-Subsystemfähigkeiten, liefert die Sekr eine zerstörerische Sprengkraft, die 33 Prozent über der gebräuchlicheren Tsunami liegt. Wie die Tsunami, kann die Serkr für den taktischen Einsatz auf eine Medusa geladen werden und mit einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 95 m/s hat diese Bombe sogar eine gute Chance selbst den schnellsten Abfängjägern zu entkommen. Piloten des GTI haben die Wirksamkeit der Serkr gegen Großkampfschiffe aller Art demonstriert."

Angesicht des Gewichts der Bombenlast, ist diese Rakete, trotz der Kraft des Antriebes, langsam. Da die Harbinger außergewöhnlich groß ist, sind GTA-Bomber darauf beschränkt, nur sechs dieser Waffen zu tragen. Die resultierende Schockwelle dieser Waffe, ist aufgrund der Größe der Sprengkraft von insgesamt 5000 Megatonnen, potenziell tödlich. Von der Nutzung in der Nähe von verbündeten Installationsanlagen oder Schiffsgruppen wird von der GTA streng abgeraten.

645, "Die erste Funktion, die Sie lernen werden ist die Zielerfassung. Erfassen Sie mich. [Drücke $T$]"

646, "In der unteren linken Ecke deines HUD ist deine Zielansicht. Die oberen Zeilen zeigen den Namen und die Klasse des erfassten Schiffes an."

647, "Die nächste Zeile zeigt die Entfernung zu Ihrem Ziel und seine Geschwindigkeit."

648, "Beachten Sie die Klammern rund um mein Schiff, welche darauf hinweisen, dass ich Ihr aktuelles Ziel bin."

649, "Wenn ich aus Ihrer Sicht fliege, wird die $quoteAußerhalb des Bildes$quote-Anzeige angezeigt. Sie zeigt in die Richtung, in die Sie wenden müssen, um Ihr Ziel zu sehen."

650, "Die kreisförmige Anzeige in der unteren Mitte Ihres HUDs ist das Radar. Freundliche Schiffe werden in Grün angezeigt. Feindliche Schiffe erscheinen Rot."

651, "Verwenden Sie Ihre Hauptflugsteuerung, um Ihr Schiff zu meinem zu wenden. Halten Sie an, wenn sich mein Schiff in Ihrem zentralen Fadenkreuz befindet."

665, "Den Ton, den Sie gehört haben, weist darauf hin, dass der Frachtbehälter inspiziert wurde. Beachten Sie die Frachtanzeige in der Zielansicht unten links."

666, "In der Nähe zur Mitte Ihres HUDs wird die Hüllenintegrität Ihres Ziels angezeigt. Beachten Sie, dass Sie unter 100% gefallen ist."

667, "Jetzt zerstören Sie C-01a."

668, "Gut. Jetzt zerstören Sie C-02b und C-03a. Denken Sie daran, sie zu erfassen. [$t$]"

669, "Lassen Sie uns sehen, wie schnell Sie diese neuen Frachtbehälter zerstören können. Erfassen Sie sie, [$t$], und zerstören Sie sie mit Ihrem ML-16."

670, "Gute Arbeit. Jetzt ist es Zeit abzufliegen. [Drücke $alt-j$]"

671, "Beachten Sie, wie sie sich bewegt, während ich herumfliege. Sie zeigt immer auf Ihr Ziel."

672, "Beachten Sie, wie sich die Dreiecke voneinander trennen. Je weiter Sie auseinander sind, desto mehr müssen Sie wenden, um Ihr Ziel zu sehen."

673, "Abschließend, beachten Sie die Zahl bei der Anzeige. Dies ist die Entfernung zu Ihrem Ziel."

674, "Gut. Jetzt folgen Sie mir. Beachten Sie, wie sich Ihre Geschwindigkeit automatisch ändert, um sich meiner anzupassen."

675, "Die Anzeige links neben Ihrer Geschwindigkeitsanzeige zeigt die verbleibende Nachbrennerkraft an. Beachten Sie, dass sie schnell verbraucht wird."

676, "Gut. Jetzt fliegen Sie auf 100 Einheiten heran und kommen Sie dann zum Halten. [$backspace$] Seien Sie vorsichtig, dass Sie nicht zu schnell fliegen."

677, "Gut gemacht! Beachten Sie, dass es einige Zeit dauert, um bis zu einem vollständigen Stopp zu kommen."

678, "Um den Inhalt eines Schiffes oder Frachtbehälters zu bestimmen, müssen Sie das Ziel erfasst und in Sicht haben und auf 150 Einheiten heranfliegen."

679, "Jetzt feuern Sie Ihre Primärwaffe auf C-01a ab. [Drücke $left ctrl$] Treffen Sie ihn ein paar Mal, aber zerstören Sie ihn nicht."

680, "Diese Information ist auch in der oberen rechten Ecke Ihrer Zielansicht verfügbar."

686, "Ein Frachtbehälter wird in das Ausbildungsgebiet geliefert. Es wird erwartet, dass Sie Ihre Erfassungs- und Feuerfähigkeiten, die Sie während Phase Eins Ihrer Ausbildung erworben haben, demonstrieren."

687, "Nach der Überprüfung der Phase Eins Ihrer Ausbildung, werden Sie fortgeschrittene Erfassungs- und Feuertechniken lernen."

688, "Sie waren erfahren genug, um die Anforderungen für all Ihre Ausbildungsziele zu erfüllen. Infolgedessen sind Sie qualifiziert zur Phase Drei Ihrer Grundausbildung voranzuschreiten. Herzlichen Glückwunsch."

689, "Sie waren in Ihren Versuchen nicht erfolgreich, die Voraussetzungen für Phase Zwei Ihrer Ausbildung zu erfüllen. Das Voranschreiten in Phase Drei der Grundausbildung hängt am erfolgreichen Abschluss aller $quotePhase Zwei$quote-Übungen ab."

690, "Dein Ziel ist es, die Subsysteme des Schiffes zu zerstören, aber nicht das Schiff. Die ausschließliche Verwendung des Disruptors erlaubt es dir, die Subsysteme zu zerstören, ohne die Drohne zu zerstören."

713, "Zerstören Sie den Frachtbehälter mit Ihrer ML-16. [Drücke $Left Ctrl$]"

714, "Schöner Schuss."

715, "Wechseln Sie Ihre Primärwaffe vom ML-16 zum Disruptor. [Drücke $.$]"

716, "Gut."

717, "Die Disruptor ist eine Energiewaffe, welche Subsysteme eines Ziels zerstört, dabei aber nur geringe Schäden an der Hülle des Ziels verursacht."

718, "Zwei Übungsdrohnen werden für diese Phase der Ausbildung verwendet."

719, "Erfassen Sie Drohne A."

720, "Jetzt erfassen Sie mein Schiff, Pilot."

721, "In Ordnung!"

722, "Sie haben eine Erfassungskontrolle, welche es Ihnen erlaubt das nächstgelegede feindliche Ziel zu erfassen [$h$]. Wenn sie schnell erneut gedrückt wird, wird sie das nächste nächstgelegene feindliche Objekt erfassen."

723, "Erfassen Sie Drohne A mit Ihrer feindlichen Zielerfassungskontrolle. [Drücke $h$]"

724, "Sie können auch Subsysteme von Schiffen erfassen [$s$]. Mit einem wiederholten Druck auf der Subsystemzielerfassungskontrolle können Sie zwischen den Subsystemen Ihres Ziels schalten."

725, "Wenn ein Subsystem erfasst wurde, wird es von einem großen Quadrat umrissen. Wenn das erfasste Objekt nicht in Sicht ist, wird es durch einen Diamanten markiert."

726, "Erfassen Sie die Sensoren auf Drohne A. [Drücke $s$]"

727, "Gute Arbeit."

728, "Sie werden die Disruptor verwenden, um die Subsysteme eines gegnerischen Schiffes zu zerstören, wenn Sie nicht wünschen, das Schiff zu zerstören. Zerstören Sie die Sensoren auf Drohne A mit der Disruptor. [Drücke $Left Ctrl$]"

729, "Warum haben Sie das getan? Fliegen Sie zur Basis zurück, überprüfen Sie die Grundlagen und kommen Sie dann zur Ausbildung zurück, wenn Sie bereit sind zu lernen."

730, "Erfassen Sie die Sensoren auf Drohne B."

731, "Beachten Sie, dass sich die Sensoren auf Drohne B nicht auf Ihrer direkten Sichtlinie befinden, obwohl Sie sie erfasst haben. Der Diamant zeigt an, wo sich das Subsystem befindet. Dies wird auch im Zielansicht-HUD angezeigt."

732, "Folgen Sie mir, Pilot."

733, "Jetzt sollten Sie eine Sicht auf die Sensoren von Drohne B haben. Falls nicht, bewegen Sie Ihr Schiff, bis Sie dem Sensorsubsystem zugewandt sind."

734, "Wenn es Ihnen befohlen wird, werden Sie Ihre Sekundärwaffe auf Drohne B abfeuern. [$Spacebar$]"

735, "Die MX-50 ist eine hitzesuchende Rakete. Wenn Ihnen befohlen wird auf Drohne B zu feuern, wird die MX-50 auf Ihr Ziel fliegen."

736, "Zerstören Sie Drohne B mit der MX-50. [Drücke $spacebar$]"

737, "Guter Schuss!"

738, "Sie haben sich erfolgreich bewährt. Gute Arbeit."

739, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot."

740, "Ich werde nicht den ganzen Tag auf Sie warten, Pilot."

741, "Große Drohnen werden für diese Phase Ihrer Ausbildung verwendet."

742, "Das war alles für die heutige Ausbildung. Ich werde jetzt Drohne A zerstören. Zögern Sie nicht, sich mir anzuschließen, Pilot."

743, "Aktivieren Sie Ihren Sprungantrieb und fliegen Sie zurück zur Basis. [Drücke $Alt-J$]"

744, "Jetzt zerstören Sie das Waffensubsystem auf Drohne A. Tun Sie dies, ohne die Drohne zu zerstören."

745, "Ausbildungsmission 3"

746, "Willkommen zur letzten Phase der Grundausbildung. In dieser Phase werden Ihre Nahkampffähigkeiten auf die Probe gestellt."

747, "Sie werden mehrere Wellen an Jägerdrohnen angreifen. Manche von ihnen sind bewaffnet. Es wird erwartet, dass Sie so viele von ihnen wie möglich zerstören. Viel Glück."

748, "Sie haben alle zehn Drohnen zerstört. Herzlichen Glückwunsch. Dies schließt Ihre Grundausbildung ab. Willkommen in der GTA-Verteidigungsliga."

749, "Sie waren nicht in der Lage alle Drohnen zu zerstören. Nahkampffähigkeiten sind das, was Piloten am Leben hält und den Krieg gewinnen wird. Ohne diese können Sie nicht in die Ränge der GTA-Verteidigungsliga aufgenommen werden."

765, "Als erstes, erfassen Sie mein Schiff. [Drücke $T$]"

766, "Sie werden feststellen, dass sich eine kreisförmige Anzeige vor meinem Schiff bewegt, solange ich mich bewege. Das ist die Vorhalteanzeige. Sie zeigt an, wohin Sie Ihre Primärwaffen schießen müssen, um Ihr Ziel zu treffen."

767, "Erfassen Sie die unbewaffnete Drohne, die gerade angekommen ist. [Drücke $T$]"

768, "Der Zielmonitor in der unteren linken Ecke Ihres HUDs zeigt die Entfernung und die Hüllenintegrität Ihres Ziels an."

769, "Die Hüllenstärke Ihres Ziels wird auch unter Ihrem Fadenkreuz angezeigt."

770, "Während ich auf die Drohne schieße, beachten Sie, dass ihre Hüllenintegrität langsam abnimmt."

771, "Eine gute Gefechtstaktik ist es, die Geschwindigkeit mit Ihrem Ziel anzupassen. Ich möchte, dass Sie sich der Geschwindigkeit der Drohne anpassen. [Drücke $M$]"

772, "Sie sollten während eines Nahkampfes die ganze Zeit in Bewegung bleiben. Jetzt zerstören Sie die Drohne."

773, "Vergessen Sie nicht, dass Sie auch Raketen haben. [Drücke $spacebar$]"

774, "Zwei neue unbewaffnete Drohnen sind angekommen. Zerstören Sie sie beide. Erinnern Sie sich daran, sich Ihrer Geschwindigkeit anzupassen. [Drücke $M$]"

775, "Diese Drohne ist bewaffnet. Sie wird in weniger als 10 Sekunden auf Sie schießen. Zerstören Sie sie."

776, "Pilot, was tun Sie? Sie nehmen soviel Schaden von einer Drohne?! Stellen Sie sich vor, was die Vasudaner mit Ihnen machen!"

777, "Versuchen Sie es noch einmal. Hier kommen zwei weitere unbewaffnete Drohnen. Zerstören Sie sie!"

778, "Hier ist eine bewaffnete Drohne. Sie haben 10 Sekunden, bevor sie das Feuer eröffnet. Zerstören Sie sie!"

779, "Pilot, Sie sind keineswegs bereit in den Kampf zu ziehen. Springen Sie zurück zur Basis, um die Ausbildungsphase 3 neu anzusetzen. [Drücke $alt-j$]"

780, "Jetzt kommt der lustige Teil. Fünf Paare an bewaffneten Drohnen werden hereinspringen. Zerstören Sie so viele, wie Sie können."

781, "Sieht so aus, als hätten Sie genug. Melden Sie sich auf der Basis zurück. [Drücke $alt-j$]"

782, "Die Unfähigkeit Anweisungen zu befolgen, führt zu sofortigem Versagen. Springen Sie zurück zur Basis, um Ausbildungsphase 3 neu anzusetzen. [Drücke $alt-j$]."

783, "Großartige Arbeit, Pilot. Grundausbildung ist abgeschlossen. Zurück zur Basis. [Drücke $alt-j$]"

784, "Grundausbildung ist abgeschlossen. Lassen Sie uns zurück zur Basis fliegen. [Drücke $alt-j$]"

785, "Ein einfacher Weg neue Feinde zu erfassen, ist die Verwendung der automatischen Zielerfassung. [Drücke $alt-h$] Diese wird automatisch Ihr nächstgelegenen Feind erfassen, nachdem Ihr aktuelles Ziel das Gebiet entweder verlassen hat oder zerstört wurde."

786, "Weiterbildungsmission 1"

787, "Willkommen bei der Weiterbildung. Im heutigen Kurs lernen Sie die Grundlagen der Kommunikation, der Gegenmaßnahmen und des Versorgungsschiffes."

788, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Sie haben Phase Eins der Weiterbildung abgeschlossen."

789, "Warum sind Sie abgeflogen, bevor die Weiterbildung beendet wurde? Sie müssen für die ganze Lektion bleiben, um den Kursabschluss angerechnet zu bekommen."

805, "Drücke [$c$], [5]"

806, "Schließe Weiterbildung ab"

807, "In Ordnung, Alpha 1. Jetzt werden Sie etwas über die Kommunikation und Gegenmaßnahmen lernen."

808, "Hier kommt Ihr erstes Ziel. Legen Sie los und erfassen Sie Frachter 01."

809, "Gut. Jetzt fordern Sie ein paar Verstärkungen an. Drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Nachrichtenfenster hervorzuheben. Von dort aus, drücken Sie die [4]-, gefolgt von der [1]-Taste und Ihre Verstärkungen werden ankommen."

810, "Jetzt zeige ich Ihnen, wie Sie Ihr Ziel mit Hilfe Ihrer Staffelpiloten entwaffnen können. Drücke Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Nachrichtenfenster erneut hervorzuheben."

811, "Jetzt wählen Sie [2], um Ihre Befehle an eine Staffel anstatt nur einem Schiff zu senden, dann die [1]-Taste um die Epsilon-Staffel auszuwählen. Mit der Auswahl der Epsilon-Staffel, senden Sie Ihre Befehle nur zu dieser Staffel. Drücken Sie abschließend die [3]-Taste um $quoteMein Ziel entwaffnen$quote auszuwählen."

812, "Beachten Sie, dass Ihre Staffelpiloten alle Anstrengungen unternommen haben, um Ihr Ziel nicht zu zerstören. Sie werden nur versuchen zu entwaffnen, so dass sichergestellt wird, dass Ihr Ziel nicht mehr in der Lage sein wird, Sie mit einer seiner Waffen anzugreifen."

813, "Der nächste Schritt wird sein, Ihr Ziel zu deaktivieren. Indem Sie diesen Befehl an Ihre Staffelpiloten geben, werden sie die Antriebe Ihres Ziels ausschalten, wodurch es sich nicht mehr bewegen kann."

814, "Sie werden erneut das Nachrichtenfenster hervorbringen, indem Sie die Kommunikationstaste drücken [$c$]. Als nächstes, wählen Sie [2] für $quoteStaffel$quote und [1] für Epsilon. Abschließend drücken Sie die [2]-Taste, um Ihr Ziel zu deaktivieren."

815, "Wie Sie sehen können, schalten Ihre Staffelpiloten jetzt die Antriebe von Frachter 01 aus. Sie werden nicht lange brauchen, um die Antriebe auf diesem Frachter auszuschalten, aber denken Sie daran, dass andere Ziele deutlich mehr Treffer für eine Deaktivierung benötigen, als dieser Frachter."

816, "Jetzt ist es Zeit, diesen Frachter aus seinem Elend zu befreien. Befehlen Sie Ihren Staffelpiloten den Frachter zu zerstören."

817, "Gut gemacht, Pilot!"

818, "Drücke den Kommunikationsknopf [$c$], um das Nachrichtenfenster hervorzuheben, gefolgt von der [2]-Taste, um eine Staffel auszuwählen, dann die [1]-Taste, um die Epsilon-Staffel auszuwählen. Abschließend drücken Sie die [1]-Taste, damit sie Ihr Ziel zerstören."

819, "Gut. Wie fühlt es sich an, Ihren ersten Abschuss befohlen zu haben? Ich hoffe, Ihnen hat es gefallen, denn ich möchte, dass Sie es erneut tun."

820, "Ich möchte, dass Sie der Epsilon-Staffel befehlen Frachter 02 zu zerstören. Haben Sie sich an Ihre vorherige Anweisung erinnert? Wenn Sie es benötigen, können Sie die Anweisungen des vorherigen gleichen Ziels ansehen."

821, "Schön gemacht, Alpha 1. Ich denke, Sie haben das verinnerlicht."

822, "Ok, Pilot. Da Sie jetzt Ihren Spaß hatten, möchte ich der Epsilon-Staffel den Abflug befehlen."

823, "In Ordnung, Pilot. Jetzt ist die Zeit, um etwas über Gegenmaßnahmen zu lernen. Eine Gegenmaßnahme präsentiert sich als neues Ziel für eine verfolgende Rakete, was dafür sorgt, dass die Rakete Ihr Schiff umgeht. Wie Sie bald sehen werden, funktioniert das aber nicht immer."

824, "Für diese Lektion bringen wir einen unserer Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse rein. Ihr Kanonier erhält die Übung ein sich bewegendes Ziel zu treffen, Sie. Machen Sie sich keine Sorgen, dies sind nur Raketenattrappen, die dazu entworfen wurden, Ihnen das Gefühl für echtes Feuer zu geben."

825, "In ein paar Sekunden wird die Neptune anfangen, Raketen auf Sie abzufeuern. Sobald sich die Raketen nähern, drücken Sie die Gegenmaßnahmentaste [$x$], um Ihre Gegenmaßnahmen abzuwerfen."

826, "Sie sollten auch sofort Ihre Vorwärtsgeschwindigkeit auf Maximum erhöhen und von der verfolgenden Rakete davonfliegen. In der Tat sollten Sie den Großteil der Zeit Ihre Nachbrenner verwenden."

827, "Wenn die Rakete Sie fast erreicht hat, starten Sie die Gegenmaßnahme. Hören Sie auf den piependen Signalton der Raketenaufschaltung, um die Entfernung der Rakete zu messen. Je schneller das Piepen, desto näher die Rakete."

828, "Während Sie Ihre Gegenmaßnahmen starten, sollten Sie auch versuchen, Ihr Schiff mit scharfen Wendemanövern zu drehen. Dies wird Ihnen weiter dabei helfen, zu vermeiden, von der Rakete getroffen zu werden."

829, "Das gibt uns gerade genug Zeit, um eine weitere Lektion rein zu quetschen."

830, "Es ist Zeit für Sie, die Gegenmaßnahmen nachzuladen. Um dies zu tun, müssen Sie ein Versorgungsschiff anfordern."

831, "Um das Versorgungsschiff andocken zu lassen, müssen Sie Ihr Schiff zum vollständigen Stillstand bringen. Das Versorgungsschiff wird dann automatisch mit Ihnen andocken. Überprüfen Sie die Anzeige im unteren Teil des HUDs, welche die geschätzte Ankunftszeit des Versorgungsschiffes anzeigt."

832, "Der primäre Zweck des Versorgungsschiffes ist zweierlei. Zuerst wird es die Sekundärwaffen und Gegenmaßnahmen Ihres Schiffes nachladen."

833, "Abschließend ist das Versorgungsschiff in der Lage kleinere Reparaturen an Ihrem Schiff durchzuführen. Es kann alle beschädigten und zerstörten Subsysteme auf Ihrem Schiff vollständig reparieren. Jedoch ist das Versorgungsschiff nicht in der Lage Ihre Haupthülle zu reparieren."

834, "In Ordnung, Pilot, jetzt ein paar mehr Übungen mit Gegenmaßnahmen. Die Neptune wird erneut auf Sie feuern. Führen Sie Ausweichmanöver durch!"

835, "In Ordnung, Pilot. Ich glaube, das war genug für heute. Die Neptune muss Ihre Übung woanders fortsetzen und wir hatten genug für einen Tag. Sie haben gute Arbeit geleistet, bedenkt man, dass Sie nur ein Rekrut sind. Zurück zur Basis."

836, "Als erstes gehen Sie sicher, dass Sie weiterhin Frachter 01 erfasst haben."

837, "Um dies zu tun, drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Nachrichtenfenster hervorzuheben. Drücken Sie dann [2] für Staffel und [1] für Epsilon. Abschließend drücken Sie [0] für den Abflug."

838, "Machen Sie sich keine Sorgen, die Raketen, die auf Sie abgefeuert werden, sind nicht geladen und werden Sie in keiner Weise gefährden."

839, "Sie werden Ihre Nachbrenner verwenden, um eine hohe Geschwindigkeit beizubehalten. Zusätzlich sollten Sie versuchen, die Raketenanzeige auf einer 3 oder 9 Uhr Position zu halten."

840, "Das werden Sie tun, indem Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$] drücken, um Ihr Nachrichtenfenster hervorzuheben, gefolgt von der [5]-Taste für das Nachladen."

841, "Überprüfen Sie Ihre Anzeige in der unteren Seite des HUDs, welche die geschätzte Ankunftszeit des Versorgungschiffes anzeigt."

842, "Denken Sie daran, dass ein Versorgungsschiff nur so viele Waffen laden kann, wie es an Bord hat. Es hat vielleicht nicht genug, um Sie vollständig nachzuladen."

843, "Wenn Sie erfolgreich einer Rakete ausgewichen sind, wird eine Anzeige im oberen Teil Ihres Zielfadenkreuzes auftauchen. Dies wird Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass Sie der Rakete tatsächlich ausgewichen sind."

844, "Die Unfähigkeit Anweisungen zu befolgen, führt zu sofortigem Versagen. Springen Sie zurück zur Basis, um die Phase Eins Ihrer Weiterbildung neu anzusetzen."

845, "Weiterbildungsmission 2"

846, "Ausbildungsmission #5.  Aspektsucher, Schildsystem."

847, "Willkommen zur Weiterbildung."

848, "Wie Sie wissen, wurde die Forschung an der neuen Schildtechnologie abgeschlossen. Schilde werden allen Jägern und Bombern hinzugefügt. In dieser Ausbildungsmission werden Sie über die Verwendung Ihres Schildsystems unterrichtet."

849, "Neben der Schildtechnologie steht jetzt auch die neue Aspektsuchende Rakete Interceptor zur Verfügung. Sie sind stärker als die MX-50, erfordern allerdings eine Aufschaltung, bevor sie abgefeuert werden können. Sie werden in dieser Mission lernen, wie Sie die Interceptor richtig verwenden."

850, "Das Schild ist eine wichtige Ergänzung zu Ihrem Schiff und die Interceptors sind eine gewaltige Ergänzung zu Ihrem Arsenal. Sie müssen lernen, wie Sie beides gut verwenden."

851, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch. Sie haben Ihre Ausbildung abgeschlossen."

852, "Sie sind vor dem Abschluss der Ausbildung abgeflogen. Sie müssen diese Ausbildungsmission abschließen, bevor Sie fortfahren."

868, "In Ordnung! Zuerst decken wir die Verwendung der Aspektsuchenden Interceptor-Raketen ab. Beachten Sie, dass sie vollständig mit Interceptors ausgestattet sind."

869, "Anders als hitzesuchende Raketen, wie die MX-50, müssen Sie eine Aufschaltung auf Ihr Ziel erhalten, damit der Aspektsucher ins Ziel lenkt."

870, "Allerdings ist der Aspektsucher diese Anstrengung auch Wert, da seine Zielsuchfähigkeiten deutlich stärker sind."

871, "Einmal abgefeuert, wird der Aspektsucher sein Ziel überall im Weltraum verfolgen. Sobald hingegen der Hitzesucher die Spur seines Ziels verliert, ist es nicht wahrscheinlich, dass er die Aufschaltung wiedererlangt."

872, "Frachter 1 fliegt gerade rein. Lassen Sie uns sehen, wie Sie sich mit diesen Interceptors machen."

873, "Erfassen Sie den Frachter. [Drücke $H$]"

874, "Beachten Sie die rote Anzeige, die sich zu Ihrem Ziel bewegt. Das ist der Aspektdiamant. Sobald sich dieser auf Ihr Ziel bewegt hat, werden Sie die Aufschaltungsanzeige sehen. Dieser bedeutet, dass Ihre Interceptors aufgeschaltet und bereit zum Abfeuern sind."

875, "Jetzt feuern Sie eine Interceptor auf den Frachter ab."

876, "Beachten Sie, wie schnell sich die Interceptor bewegt. Sie liefern auch eine durchaus gute Sprengkraft."

877, "Beachten Sie, dass die Interceptor nahezu nutzlos ist, wenn sie abgefeuert wird, bevor eine Aufschaltung erreicht wurde. Das ist ein entscheidender Unterschied zwischen der Interceptor und der MX-50."

878, "Jetzt erfassen Sie das Waffensubsystem auf dem Frachter. [Drücke $S$ bis zur Erfassung]"

879, "Gut. Jetzt warten Sie, bis Sie eine Aufschaltung auf das Waffensubsystem erhalten haben."

880, "Jetzt feuern Sie Ihre Interceptors ab, bis das Waffensubsystem zerstört wurde."

881, "Gut gemacht! Beachten Sie, dass Ihre Interceptors bei der Zerstörung von Subsystemen auf großen Zielen wirksam sein werden."

882, "Jetzt feuern Sie Ihre Interceptors ab, bis Sie Frachter 1 zerstört haben."

883, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Jetzt ist die Zeit ein paar bewegliche Ziele zu zerstören."

884, "Eine Salve an Interceptors kann alle 3 Sekunden abgefeuert werden. Feuern Sie eine weitere Salve ab und beachten Sie den Runterzähler in Ihrer Waffenanzeige."

885, "Ihr Schiff ist mit der neuen Schildtechnologie ausgerüstet. Sie ist in der Lage eine große Menge an eingehender Waffenenergie zu absorbieren."

886, "Da das Schild Schäden absorbiert, wird es schwächer. Allerdings regeneriert es sich im Laufe der Zeit automatisch."

887, "Ihre Schildintegritätsanzeige befindet sich rechts unten im HUD. Sie blinkt jetzt."

890, "Beachten Sie, dass die Vorderseite Ihres Schildes blinkt, als ob Sie Schaden genommen hätten."

891, "Beachten Sie, wie sich die Anzeige verändert, während Ihr Schild mehr Schaden nimmt. Wenn ein Schildquadrant zerstört wurde, wird der gesamte Schaden auf die darunterliegende Hülle weitergeleitet."

892, "Beachten Sie, dass Ihr Schild sich im Laufe der Zeit wieder auflädt. Ich werde diesen Prozess beschleunigen, um Zeit zu sparen."

893, "Jetzt beobachten Sie, wie sich der vordere Quadrant Ihres Schildes selbst zu voller Stärke repariert."

894, "Jetzt hat sich Ihr Schild zu voller Stärke wieder aufgeladen. Als nächstes werden wir die Schildverwaltung abdecken."

895, "Es gibt eine Reihe an Möglichkeiten, wie Sie Ihr Schild verwalten können. Die einfachste ist die Quadrantenausgleich-Funktion."

896, "Gut gemacht! Beachten Sie, dass Ihre Frontsektion weitgehend wieder aufgeladen wurde. Dies gelang auf Kosten der Schildenergie von den drei anderen Quadranten."

897, "Ich habe Ihren vorderen Schildquadranten erneut beschädigt. Jetzt verwenden Sie die Quadrantenausgleich-Funktion, um Ihren vorderen Quadranten zu reparieren. [Drücke $q$]"

898, "Ich werde jetzt den Großteil Ihrer Schildstärke reduzieren. Beachten Sie, dass drei Ihrer vier Quadranten jetzt bei fast null sind."

899, "Jetzt werden Sie lernen, wie man die Schildstärke in einem bestimmten Quadranten maximiert."

900, "Zuerst werden Sie die Stärke in Ihrem vorderen Quadranten maximieren. [Drücke mehrmals $Up Arrow$]"

901, "Gut gemacht! Beachten Sie, dass Ihr vorderer Quadrant jetzt auf voller Stärke ist, während die anderen geschwächt sind."

902, "Ihren vorderen Schildquadranten zu maximieren ist besonders nützlich, wenn Sie ein großes Schiff gegen sein Turmfeuer angreifen."

903, "Jetzt möchte ich, dass Sie Ihren hinteren Schildquadranten maximieren. [Drücke mehrmals $Down Arrow$]"

904, "Wenn Sie ein wichtiges Ziel verfolgen und von hinten angegriffen werden, kann die Maximierung Ihres hinteren Schildquadranten sehr nützlich sein."

905, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Aspektsuchende Raketen sind ein wichtiger Teil Ihres Arsenals. Verwenden Sie sie gut."

906, "Und die richtige Schildverwaltung kann in einer entscheidenden Schlacht den Unterschied ausmachen."

907, "Dies schließt Ihre Ausbildung ab. Zurück zur Basis."

908, "Um eine Aspektaufschaltung auf ein bewegliches Ziel zu erhalten, müssen Sie die Zielaufschaltung rund um Ihr Fadenkreuz im HUD halten."

909, "Ich werde jetzt Jägerdrohnen anfordern. Wenn die erste Drohne einfliegt, erfassen Sie sie und erlangen Sie eine Aufschaltung. Versuchen Sie die Zielanzeige in der Mitte Ihres HUDs zu halten."

910, "Sobald Sie eine Aufschaltung erhalten haben, feuern Sie eine Interceptor ab, um die Drohne zu zerstören. Beachten Sie, dass diese Drohnen keine Gegenmaßnahmen verwenden werden."

911, "Gut gemacht! Jetzt lassen Sie uns etwas Schwierigeres versuchen. Staffeln von je zwei Drohnen werden auf einmal auftauchen. Zerstören Sie sie alle."

912, "In Ordnung! Jetzt machen wir mit Ihrem Schildsystem weiter."

913, "Beachten Sie, dass Sie in der Reichweite dieser Drohnen sein müssen, bevor Sie eine Aspektaufschaltung erhalten. Fliegen Sie zu ihnen."

Sie werden das Gebiet rund um die $f GTC $f Orff patrouillieren. Die $f GTC $f Orff erlitt im Betelgeuse-System einen Antriebszusammenbruch und wartet auf Reparaturen."

918, "Sie werden mit einem anderen Schiff, $f Alpha $f 2 auf der Wache sein. Da dies Ihre erste Wache ist, wird $f Alpha $f 2 von Hauptmann Harbison geflogen, ein erfahrener Veteran und ein erstklassiger Pilot."

919, "Sie werden Ihre Wache mit einem Sprung nach Betelgeuse in der Nähe der $f GTC $f Orff beginnen."

920, "Wir haben Berichte über vasudanische Jäger in diesem System, so seien Sie wachsam. Greifen Sie jeden Feind an welcher die $f Orff bedroht und zerstören Sie ihn."

921, "Am Ende Ihrer Wache werden Sie von der $f Delta$| -Staffel abgelöst. Bei $f Deltas Ankunft fliegen Sie zur Basis zurück."

922, "Ihr Primärziel ist es, die $f Orff bis zum Ende Ihrer Wache zu beschützen. Wir erwarten, dass Sie Ihre Befehle buchstabengetreu ausführen."

923, "Sie können Ihre Schiffswahl und Waffenbestückung für diese Mission bestätigen. Wenn Sie zufrieden sind, starten Sie die Mission. $f GTD $f Galatea Achterdeck Ende."

924, "Die GTC Orff wurde während Ihrer Wache zerstört. Dutzende an Leben gingen wegen Ihrer schlechten Leistung verloren. Diese Katastrophe wird sicherlich zu einer erhöhten vasudanischen Anwesenheit im System führen.

Es gibt keinen Platz für Sie in der GTA. Sie können wegtreten."

925, "Wenn du die vasudanischen Jäger abschießt, bevor sie die Orff erreichen, sind sie nicht in der Lage sie zu beschädigen. Konzentriere dich nur auf einen Jäger zur gleichen Zeit. Wenn dieser zerstört ist, nimm dir den nächsten vor. Nachdem die Delta-Staffel eingetroffen ist, kannst du zur Basis zurückkehren."

926, "Sie haben bei Ihrer ersten Wache einen guten Job gemacht, Pilot. Ihr starkes Pflichtgefühl wird der Allianz gut dienen.

Die Anwesenheit von Vasudanern gibt uns wenig Grund zur Sorge. Die Schiffe, die Sie und die Orff angegriffen haben, waren wohl die Reste des vasudanischen Konvois, den wir letzte Woche erwischt haben."

927, "Deine Leistung war ausgezeichnet. Wir haben keine Empfehlungen für dich."

928, "Trotz Ihrer Bemühungen sind vasudanische Jäger dem System entkommen. Wenn wir ihnen erlauben, uns zu entkommen, erscheinen wir schwach, Pilot. Wir werden diese Art der Peinlichkeit kein weiteres Mal tolerieren."

929, "Wenn du Probleme hast, die Vasudaner abzuschießen, versuche Raketen zu starten. MX-50 suchen automatisch ein feindliches Ziel, welches in Reichweite ist. Nachdem Delta angekommen ist, kannst du ihnen noch helfen, indem du mehr Vasudaner zerstörst."

930, "Wir sind traurig, von Hauptmann Harbisons Tod zu erfahren. Er war ein tapferer und geschickter Pilot. Eine Gedenkfeier wird um 09:30 Uhr stattfinden. Sie sind aufgerufen, daran teilzunehmen."

931, "Nächstes Mal versuche die Sicherheit deines Staffelpiloten zu gewährleisten. Wenn er Hilfe anfordert, greife das Schiff an, dass ihn angreift."

932, "Sie haben das Schlachtfeld verlassen, bevor Ihre Wache beendet war. Dieser Akt der Feigheit wird Ihre Dienstakte für den Rest Ihrer Militärkarriere beschmutzen.

Sie wurden vom Flugdienst suspendiert. Wegtreten."

Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Pilot! Aufgrund Ihrer ausgezeichneten Dienstakte, wurden Sie dafür auserwählt, an der Operation Templar teilzunehmen. Dies ist ein gemeinsames terranisch-vasudanisches Bestreben, mit dem Ziel, die letzten Überreste der vasudanischen Fanatiker, die sich selbst Hammer des Lichts nennen, auszulöschen."

994, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-5r $b Prometheus $b R

Seit dem Kontaktverlust mit der Erde, wurde die Verfügbarkeit der Avenger und der Prometheus extrem eingeschränkt. Eine terranisch-vasudanische Forschungsgruppe hat einen Nachbau der Prometheus entwickelt, welche synthetische Gase verwendet, womit allerdings Schadenspotenzial geopfert wurde.

Die Prometheus R wird allen Piloten der Allianz als Standardbewaffnung ausgegeben."

995, "$b Neue $b Freigabe: $b GVW $b Akheton $b SDG

Ihnen wird ebenfalls die Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun, übersetzt Subsystemstörungskanone, ausgegeben. Sie ist höchst wirksam gegen Schild- und Subsystemen.

Die Akheton ist dafür entworfen, mit vasudanischen Energiesystemen zu funktionieren. Möglicherweise müssen Sie Ihren Waffensystemen mehr Energie zuweisen, um effektiv kämpfen zu können."

996, "$b Neue $b Freigabe: $b GTM-X1 $b Serkr

Der Serkr Anti-Großkampfschiff-Torpedo wurde jetzt endlich in die Massenproduktion gebracht. Während der Hades Rebellion vom GTI entwickelt, ist der sehr modulare Entwurf der stärkste Sprengkopf in unserem Arsenal.

Vorräte älterer Waffen sind begrenzt, so wählen Sie Ihre Bestückung entsprechend sorgfältig aus."

$b Willkommen $b beim $b GTI

Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Pilot. Sie wurden für den Spezialoperationszweig des Galaktisch Terranischen Geheimdienst ausgewählt. Sie haben die strengen medizinischen und psychologischen Untersuchungen des GTI bestanden und ihre Dienstakte unter Admiral Po auf der GTD Intrepid war vorbildlich. Sie sind nun dem GTI-Zerstörer für Spezialoperationen, der GTD Krios, zugewiesen.

Die Primäraufgabe des GTI ist es, das terranische Oberkommando mit genauen und umfassenden Informationen über die Taktik, den Technologien, Aktivitäten und die strategischen Ziele unserer Feinde, insbesondere der Shivaner und den vasudanischen Aufständischen, dem Hammer des Lichts, zu versorgen.

Als ein Pilot für Spezialoperationen werden Ihre Missionen die Informationsbeschaffung und Eindämmung beinhalten. Diese Einsätze sind geheim. Eine Verletzung des Geheimhaltungsprotokolls führt zu einem Militärgericht und einer möglichen Hinrichtung im Rahmen des Spionagen- und Gegenspionagengesetz!"

Alle Bemühungen, den Kontakt mit der Erde wiederherzustellen, sind gescheitert. Wie Sie wissen, brach der Sol-Sprungknoten in Delta Serpentis, kurz nachdem verbündete Streitkräfte die Lucifer während Ihres Subraumsprungs verfolgten und zerstörten, zusammen. Wir glauben, dass die Explosion der fünf Reaktoren der Lucifer eine Subraumkatastrophe erzeugte, die den Knoten, vielleicht dauerhaft, geschlossen hat.

Wir haben kein Wort darüber gehört, was aus den terranischen Piloten geworden ist, die die Lucifer zerstörten oder wie viel von der Angriffsstreitmacht auf der Erdseite des Knotens gestrandet ist.

Kulturelle und politische Unterschiede bedrohen den terranisch-vasudanischen Vertrag seit Anfang an.

Darüber hinaus haben Zwischenfälle von Gewalt zwischen terranischen und vasudanischen Militärangehörigen die, ohnehin schon prekäre, Situation verschlimmert."

1316, "$b Übereifrige $b Piloten

Die GTA und PVN führen gemeinsame Operationen im Vega-System durch. Obwohl die Feindseligkeiten zwischen alliierten Streitkräften in Vega auf vereinzelte Episoden beschränkt sind, haben sich die Spannungen jetzt nun zu einer allumfassenden Konfrontation verschärft. Während eines kürzlich erfolgten shivanischen Angriffes feuerten terranische Piloten auf vasudanische Schiffe mit der Absicht, sie abzuschießen. Das terranische Oberkommando befürchtet, dass, wenn die PVN von diesem Vorfall erfährt, der Vertrag und damit unsere Hoffnungen, die Shivaner zu besiegen, bald zusammenbrechen werden."

1317, "$b Mission $b unter $b Verschluss

Diese Mission wurde auf der höchsten Stufe als geheim eingestuft. Sollten Sie während der Erfüllung Ihrer Ziele getötet oder gefangen genommen werden, wird die GTI jede Kenntnis von Ihnen oder Ihren Handlungen abstreiten."

1318, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-43 $b Leech

Die Sekundäraufgabe des GTI ist die Erforschung und Entwicklung von den neuesten Technologien. Als ein Pilot für Spezialoperationen werden Sie Zugriff auf fortgeschrittene Waffen und Kriegsschifftechnologien haben, die noch nicht für GTA-Piloten verfügbar sind. Diese Systeme wurden umfangreichen Labor- und Feldversuchen unterzogen und sollten wie gedacht funktionieren.

Die Leech entleert die Energieversorgung von gegnerischen Jägern. Verwenden Sie die Leech, um Nachbrenner, Energiewaffen und Schilde zu deaktivieren. Es ist keine Erfassung von Subsystemen notwendig, einfach zielen und schießen. Die Leech ist eine Anti-Jäger-Waffe mit minimaler Wirkung gegen größere Schiffe."

1319, "Um etwa 15:30 Uhr haben terranische und vasudanische Jäger einen shivanischen Angriff auf das Forschungsschiff Fermi abgewehrt. Während des Gefechts feuerten terranische Piloten auf unsere vasudanischen Verbündeten mit der Absicht zu töten."

1320, "Die Motive dieser Piloten sind unklar. Wir glauben nicht, dass ihre Handlungen einen groß angelegten Aufstand in den terranischen Reihen repräsentieren, aber die Situation muss unter Kontrolle gebracht werden."

1321, "Die Feindseligkeiten sind zu einer allumfassenden Konfrontation zwischen terranischen und vasudanischen Streitkräften in dem Gebiet eskaliert. Ein Kommunikationsterminal des GTI in dem Sektor übermittelte eine verschlüsselte Nachricht, die das Oberkommando über die Situation unterrichtete, welche unseren Vertrag mit den Vasudanern zu gefährden droht."

1322, "Ihr Ziel ist es, das Gebiet zu säubern. Zerstören Sie alles, außer das GTI-Kommunikationsterminal. Alle Stimmen müssen zum Schweigen gebracht werden, um die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz zu bewahren."

1323, "Diese Mission hat ein Operationszeitraum von fünf Minuten. Fliegen Sie rein, machen Sie Ihre Arbeit und fliegen Sie wieder raus. Viel Glück, Pilot!"

1324, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Sie haben eine Säuberung des Gebietes durchgeführt und einen explosiven Vorfall unter Kontrolle gebracht. Ein einziges vasudanische Schiff ist entkommen, aber der GTI wird diese Bedrohung bald beseitigen."

1325, "Der Transporter, der entkam, war zu weit weg, um von dir eliminiert zu werden."

1326, "Sie haben Ihren Operationszeitraum überschritten, Pilot. Dieser Fehlschlag gibt der GTA genügend Beweise, um den Vorfall zu rekonstruieren. Sie haben die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz gefährdet und die GTA hat ihre Unterstützung für unsere Operationen versagt. Sie haben permanentes Flugverbot."

1327, "Zerstöre alle Ziele innerhalb deines Fünf-Minuten-Fensters."

1328, "Sie haben den vasudanischen Transporter nicht zum Schweigen gebracht. Sie haben die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz gefährdet und die GTA hat ihre Unterstützung für unsere Operationen versagt. Sie haben bis auf weiteres Flugverbot."

1329, "Zerstöre den Transporter! Vielleicht solltest du die Beta-Staffel einsetzen, um diese Aufgabe zu erledigen, während du und die Alpha-Staffel die anderen Schiffe angreifst."

1330, "Zwei Ziele sind entkommen! Der GTI verfolgte das erste Schiff und brachte es zum Schweigen, aber das zweite wich unseren Streitkräften aus und informierte die Vasudaner über unsere Operation. Ihr Versagen hat unseren Vertrag mit den Vasudanern aufs Spiel gesetzt. Sie haben bis auf weiteres Flugverbot."

1331, "Sei dir die Positionen aller Schiffe in dem Gebiet bewusst. Du kannst es dir nicht leisten, irgendeins entkommen zu lassen."

1332, "Zerstöre alle Zeugen"

1333, "Säubere das Gebiet von allen Zeugen"

1334, "Alpha 1, das Terminal sendete ein SOS an die Vasudaner im nächsten System."

1335, "Ein vasudanisches Ziel konnte entkommen, Alpha 1. Raten dem Oberkommando es zu verfolgen und zu neutralisieren."

1336, "Alpha 1, ein Transporter der Isis-Klasse ist auf dem Weg zum Terminal. Zerstören Sie den Transporter! Wiederhole: Zerstören Sie den Transporter! Keine Übertragung darf dieses System verlassen!"

1337, "Aries 3 hat den Sprung gemacht. Die Situation ist außer Kontrolle! Rückkehr zur Basis."

1338, "Aries 2 ist entkommen. Berichten dem Oberkommando. Bringen Sie Ihren Kopf in den Kampf und erledigen Sie Ihre Mission, Alpha 1!"

1339, "Alpha 1, die Eindämmung ist kritisch. Aries 2 bricht zum Sprungknoten durch."

1340, "Aries 3 ist auf dem Weg zum Terminal. Zerstören Sie Aries 3, Alpha 1! Lassen Sie uns hier die vasudanische Armada heraushalten."

1341, "Was geht hier vor sich Pilot?"

1342, "Alpha 1, diese Mission ist aufgeflogen! Zurück zur Basis."

1343, "Die Verfolgung"

1344, "Ein vasudanisches Schiff, Bezeichnung Aries 2, ist unserer Eindämmungsoperation entkommen. Der GTI hat das Schiff zu einer vasudanisch kontrollierten Versorgungszone verfolgt."

1345, "Aries 2 hat unsere Ziele den vasudanischen Streitkräften in diesem Sektor mitgeteilt. Wir stören zwar alle örtlichen Übertragungen, aber wir müssen eine absolute Eindämmung erreichen."

1346, "Ihre Mission wird es sein, alle Schiffe in der Versorgungszone zu zerstören. Ignorieren Sie die Fracht. Vorbereitende Aufklärungen deuten auf eine Garnison von zwei Aten-Kreuzern mit Jägereskorte hin."

1347, "Der Verlust unschuldigen Lebens ist zwar bedauerlich, aber notwendig, um die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz zu bewahren und die Shivaner zu besiegen. Sie dürfen nicht versagen!"

1348, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Sie haben überlegene Streitkräfte besiegt, die unsere Aufklärung nicht vorhersehen konnte. Die Fluchtkapsel des Wissenschaftsschiffes überlebten den Angriff, aber der GTI wird sie verfolgen und eliminieren. Die Analyse zeigt, dass Sie keine andere Wahl hatten, als der Schockwelle der Explosion zu entkommen. Sie haben ein gutes Urteil unter Feuer gefällt, Pilot!"

1349, "Um zu überleben, musst du die Fluchtkapseln zurücklassen. Es gibt keine Möglichkeit die Fluchtkapseln zu zerstören und zu Überleben."

1350, "Das Abbrechen einer Mission ohne entsprechenden Befehl ist eine Insubordination, Pilot! Sie haben die Gelegenheit diese Handlungen morgen um 08:00 Uhr bei Ihrem Militärgericht zu erklären."

1351, "Breche niemals eine Mission ab, es sei denn es wird dir befohlen."

1352, "Zerstöre alle Gegner"

1353, "Zerstöre Einstein"

1354, "Eliminiere alle Schiffe im Gebiet."

1355, "Terranisches Wissenschaftsschiff ist reingesprungen. Angreifen und Zerstören! Nehmen Sie keine Gefangenen, Alpha 1!"

1356, "Hier ist das terranische Wissenschaftsschiff Einstein. Brechen Sie Ihren Angriff ab! Wir haben flüchtige Materialien an Bord!"

1357, "Alpha 1, Sie haben Ihre Befehle. Zerstören Sie die Einstein!"

1358, "Alpha 1, entfernen Sie sich von der Einstein! Die Sensoren erfassen einen gewaltigen Energieanstieg!"

1359, "Geister"

1360, "Der GTI hat die Fluchtkapseln der Einstein im $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-System entdeckt!"

1361, "Das Oberkommando hat eine neue Anweisung ausgegeben. Ihre Mission wird es sein, das Gebiet zu sichern und die Kapseln zu bewachen. Ein Schiff wird die Überlebenden für die Vernehmung bergen."

1362, "Wir werden das Bergungsschiff so schnell wie möglich einsetzen. Verteidigen Sie diese Kapseln, bis Sie abgelöst werden. Sie werden weitere Befehle in Beta Aquilae erhalten."

1363, "Der Vorfall in Beta Aquilae hat uns verwirrt. Das Oberkommando erkennt an, dass Sie keine Möglichkeit hatten, den Berechtigungsstatus des Zerstörers zu bestätigen. Unter diesen Umständen haben Sie hervorragende Arbeit geleistet die Bergung einer Fluchtkapsel sicherzustellen."

1364, "In dieser Mission kann nur eine Fluchtkapsel gerettet werden."

1365, "Sie haben bis auf weiteres Flugverbot, Pilot. Mit keinem der Überlebenden in unserer Obhut sind unsere Geheimdienstbemühungen vergeblich."

1366, "Überwache den Status der Fluchtkapseln."

1367, "Sie haben Ihre Mission vor dem Abschluss abgebrochen. Sie werden verpflichtet sein vor einem Gerichtsprozess eine vollständige Aussage zu liefern. Wegtreten!"

1368, "Eskortiere Fluchtkapseln"

1369, "Eskortiere die Fluchtkapseln bis zur Ablösung"

1370, "Fluchtkapseln, hören Sie zu. Alpha wird Sie eskortieren, bis ein Bergungsschiff hierherkommt. Wenn Sie nicht einwilligen, haben sie Befehl, das Feuer zu eröffnen."

1371, "Zerstörer ist unterwegs."

1372, "Kapseln, halten Sie sich fern. Wir werden das regeln."

1373, "Alpha 1, bereiten Sie sich auf die Bergung der Kapseln vor. Halten Sie die Eskorte aufrecht. Setzen Verstärkungen zur Unterstützung ein."

Eine vorläufige Analyse des Vorfalls in Beta Aquilae kam zum Ergebnis, dass die Jäger, die Sie angegriffen haben, fortgeschrittene Tarntechnologien besaßen. Der Ursprung und die Absicht dieser Streitmacht bleibt unbekannt und das terranische Oberkommando hat eine vollständige Untersuchung beantragt.

Die Detonationen erzeugen ein Feld an Energiestößen, was die Cluster Bomb, übersetzt Streubombe, damit höchst wirksam gegen Jägerformationen macht."

1383, "Eine shivanische Offensive hat unsere Streitkräfte im Ikeya-System dezimiert. Der Feind vernichtete unsere Installationsanlagen und achtzig Prozent der Flotte, die in diesem System stationiert war. Die Überlebenden ziehen sich gerade zu sicheren terranischen Positionen zurück."

1384, "Glücklicherweise hat der Wissenschaftskreuzer Ratna den Angriff überstanden. Wissenschaftler an Bord dieses Schiffes sind die Speerspitze des Eumenides-Projektes und haben modernste Waffenprototypen entwickelt, welche für die Kriegsanstrengungen von entscheidender Bedeutung sind."

1385, "Die Shivaner haben die Ratna deaktiviert, so dass das Schiff weder Antrieb- noch Sprungfähigkeiten hat. Wir müssen unser Schiff, seine Wissenschaftler und ihre Prototypen retten. Das Oberkommando erwartet, dass shivanische Verstärkungen bald ihre Offensive fortführen werden."

1386, "Unter diesen Umständen müssen wir ein risikoreiches Manöver durchführen, um die Ratna zu bergen. Der vasudanische Transporter Gemini wird mit dem Schiff andocken und es vom shivanischen Angriffspunkt wegschleppen. Die Andockklammern könnten vielleicht nicht halten, aber wir haben keine andere realisierbaren Optionen."

1387, "Das Oberkommando wird zusätzliche terranische Transporter einsetzen, um die Wissenschaftler zu evakuieren. Wir können die Waffenprototypen nicht von der Ratna extrahieren, weshalb das gesamte Schiff geborgen werden muss."

1388, "Ihre Mission: Beschützen Sie die Ratna. Wehren Sie den shivanischen Angriff ab, damit Reparaturmannschaften die Antriebe wieder aktivieren können. Der weitere Verlauf dieses Krieges liegt in Ihren Händen, Pilot!"

1389, "Sie haben den Feind aufgehalten, womit unsere Transporter die Wissenschaftler evakuieren konnten. Wir brauchen ihr Fachwissen, um diesen Krieg zu gewinnen, Pilot. Gute Arbeit!"

1390, "Gut gemacht!"

1391, "Wegen Ihrer hervorragenden Leistung haben wir die Ratna und ihre Prototypen geborgen. Sie sollten sehr stolz auf sich sein, Pilot! Sie haben nicht nur das Eumenides-Projekt gerettet, sondern vielleicht auch das Leben von Millionen."

1392, "Sie haben dabei versagt, unseren Transportern angemessene Jägerdeckung zu geben. Infolgedessen konnten wir die Wissenschaftler weder evakuieren, noch die Prototypen bergen. Nicht Mittelmäßigkeit wird diesen Krieg gewinnen, sondern Technologie. Wissen ist Macht, Pilot und Sie fliegen ahnungslos. Wegtreten!"

1393, "Du musst die gegnerischen Jäger von der Ratna fernhalten."

$b Unbekannte $b Jäger

Während der Bergung der Fluchtkapseln der Einstein in Beta Aquilae, haben nicht identifizierte Jäger Ihre Staffel angegriffen. Die Ergebnisse unserer Nachforschung sind rätselhaft: Die Schiffe waren Jäger der Loki-Klasse, vom GTI entwickelt und hergestellt.

Die Forschung und Entwicklung des GTI schuf die Jäger der Loki-Klasse an einer streng geheimen Installationsanlage, dessen Ort nicht bekannt ist. Der Loki, der Prototyp eines Tarnjäger-Projektes, ist entworfen, um sich aller bekannten Sensoreinrichtungen zu entziehen."

1441, "$b Gute $b und $b Schlechte $b Nachrichten

Die Analyse des $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-Angriffes hat es unseren Ingenieuren ermöglicht, eine strukturelle Schwäche im Loki auszunutzen, womit seine Tarntechnologie nutzlos gemacht wird. Wir haben diese Information mit unseren vasudanischen Verbündeten geteilt und wir erwarten, dass auch die Shivaner das Wissen haben, um den Jäger zu enthüllen.

Dieser Vorfall signalisiert jedoch eine noch beunruhigende Entwicklung: Die Entstehung eines abtrünnigen Teils innerhalb des GTI. Wir vermuten, dass eine aufständische Zelle den Loki für unbekannte Zwecke zu eigen gemacht hat. Allerdings verhindert die Geheimhaltung rund um das Tarnprojekt weitere Nachforschungen."

1442, "$b Die $b Einstein

Das Auftauchen der Einstein im Vega-System ist ebenfalls beunruhigend.

Anhand der Dienstprotokolle wurde die Einstein während der ersten shivanischen Begegnung in Ross 128, wo der Feind alle terranischen Schiffe und Installationsanlagen vernichtete, zerstört. Die Einstein flog drei Tage vor dem Angriff in das System ein, um eine routinemäßige geologische Untersuchung durchzuführen.

Es ist offensichtlich, dass die Anwesenheit der Einstein in Vega, während einer unserer letzten Operationen, dem offiziellen Bericht widerspricht."

1443, "$b Ross $b 128

Darüber hinaus deuten die Beweise darauf hin, dass die Einstein ein abtrünniges GTI-Schiff gewesen sein könnte. Eine hochrangige GTI-Offizierin, Kapitän Ezra Tycho, befehligte dieses Wissenschaftsschiff. Obwohl die offiziellen Pflichten auf niedrigstufige planetarische Studien beschränkt waren, könnte die Einstein in verdeckte Operationen und Waffenforschungen beteiligt gewesen sein. Nach der Analyse der Daten, die wir bisher gesammelt haben, glauben wir, dass ein abtrünniger Teil innerhalb des GTI bereits vor dem Angriff auf Ross 128 von der Existenz der shivanischen Bedrohung gewusst haben könnte."

1444, "$b Abtrünniger $b Teil

Deshalb vermuten wir, dass die Jäger der Loki-Klasse mit einer GTI-Vertuschung zu tun hatten. Der Angriff auf Ihre Staffel im $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-System kann ein verpfuschter Versuch gewesen sein, sämtliche Beweise für die Existenz der Einstein zu vernichten.

Das Ausmaß der Vertuschung und die Ziele der Verschwörung bleiben unbekannt. Ihnen wird geraten, während Ihrer nächsten Einsätze vorsichtig zu sein."

1445, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTF $b Loki

Als der neueste Prototyp, der vom Tarnprojekt des GTI entworfen wurde, verfügt der Loki über eine hohe Höchstgeschwindigkeit und eine hervorragende Manövrierfähigkeit. Wegen einer kleinen strukturellen Schwäche ist die Tarnfähigkeit der Loki allerdings aufgeflogen. Dennoch ist der Loki der vielseitigste Jäger in unserem Arsenal."

Entwickelt als eine Anti-Shivaner Waffe, fügt der Shield Breaker, übersetzt Schildbrecher, riesigen Schaden an gegnerischen Verteidigungssystemen zu. Diese Waffe verursacht keine strukturellen Schäden, aber in Verbindung mit einer Anti-Hüllen-Kanone ist er sehr effektiv gegen große shivanische Bomber, wie der Seraphim.

Verwenden Sie sie gut."

1447, "Piraten haben die Talus Mineneinrichtung angegriffen. Da diese Installationsanlage entscheidend für die Verarbeitung von Materialien für unsere Sprengkopfproduktion ist, ist die Kontrolle über Talus von größter strategischer Bedeutung."

1448, "Die Garnison der Einrichtung konnte den Piratenangriff abwehren, erlitt dabei aber Verluste von neunzig Prozent. Bestimmte flüchtige Materialien entkamen aus der Eindämmung und die daraus resultierende Explosion vernichtete die Piratenstreitmacht. Allerdings hat die Explosion auch die strukturelle Integrität der Installationsanlage stark beeinträchtigt."

1449, "Ihr Pirmärziel ist es, unsere Transporter zu eskortieren, während sie die restlichen Sprengkopfmaterialien bergen."

1450, "Seien Sie darauf hingewiesen, dass die Explosion ein ionisiertes Gas freigesetzt hat, das kleine Schiffe für Sensoren unsichtbar macht. Dadurch wird die Raketenaufschaltung auf Ziele innerhalb der ionisierten Zone unmöglich gemacht."

1451, "Sobald die Operation begonnen hat, wird die Einrichtung mit ihrer Evakuierung beginnen. Allerdings muss die Fracht Ihre erste Priorität haben. Erst nachdem die Materialien geborgen wurden, sollen Sie die Fluchtkapseln schützen. Wir bedauern jegliche Verluste, die sich daraus ergeben können, aber der strategische Wert der Sprengkopfmaterialien erfordert diese Entscheidung."

1452, "Command wird Bomber einsetzen, um die Einrichtung zu zerstören, nachdem alle Materialen und Überlebende geborgen und gerettet wurden."

1453, "Aufgrund der starken Subraumaktivität in dem Gebiet, sollten wir einen shivanischen Angriff gegen unsere Operation erwarten."

Um die Daten auszulöschen, die über ihre Aktivitäten im $quoteRoss 128$quote-System gesammelt wurden, zerstörte der Galaktisch Terranische Geheimdienst die Krios. Alle Überlebenden Besatzungsmitglieder werden ab sofort der GTD Soyakaze neu zugewiesen."

1517, "$b Der $b GTI

Die Verschwörung ist nicht auf einen abtrünnigen Teil innerhalb des GTI beschränkt, sondern schließt Offiziere in den obersten Reihen des Geheimdienst-Direktorium ein. Obwohl ihre Ziele unklar sind, glaubt das Oberkommando, dass die Verschwörer die GTA-Regierung stürzen wollen, um den terranisch-vasudanischen Vertrag aufzulösen.

Alles Personal, Schiffe und Installationsanlagen des Galaktisch Terranischen Geheimdienstes sind ab jetzt feindliche Ziele. Aufgrund der Technologie und den empfindlichen Informationen, auf die sie Zugriff haben, stellt die GTI eine erhebliche Bedrohung für die Stabilität und Sicherheit der GTA, der PVN und aller verbündeten Welten dar. Unsere Aktionen müssen schnell und entschlossen erfolgen.

Das Hauptziel der Soyakaze ist es, die GTI-Operationsbasis zu lokalisieren und zu zerstören."

1518, "$b Ross $b 128

Die Soyakaze hat Kurs auf das $quoteRoss 128$quote-System gesetzt. Informationen, die von der Krios erlangt wurden, zeigen, dass sich die GTI-Operationen rund um den Ort des ersten shivanischen Angriffes konzentrieren. Unsere erste Aufgabe ist es, diese Aktivität zu untersuchen."

1519, "$b General $b Scott

Ich werde jetzt diese Gelegenheit nutzen, um den verstorbenen General Scott, Kommandeur der GTD Krios, der in Ausübung seiner Pflicht gestorben ist, zu ehren.

General Scott widmete viele Jahre seiner Dienstzeit dem GTI und war von ihrer Mission überzeugt: Die GTA und ihre Verbündeten mit genauen und umfassenden Informationen über die Taktik, Technologien, Aktivitäten und strategische Zielen ihrer Feinde zu versorgen.

Seine Vorgesetzten, denen er sein Vertrauen und seine Treue geschworen hatte, haben General Scott betrogen, als sie diese Mission aufgaben, um ihr korruptes Bestreben und ihren korrupten Plänen zu verfolgen.
Jetzt ist der GTI der Feind.

Lassen Sie uns niemals die Rechtschaffenheit und das Opfer dieses ausgezeichneten Offiziers vergessen!"

1520, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTM-11 $b EM $b Pulse

Ohne die Technologie und das Wissen der Forschungs- und Entwicklungsabteilung des GTI fehlt es uns an den neuartigen Waffensystemen und Schiffprototypen unserer Feinde. Allerdings haben wir eine neue Ergänzung unseres Arsenals: Die EM Pulse.

Beim Aufprall deaktiviert die EM Pulse, übersetzt Elektromagnetischer Impuls, die elektronischen Systeme des Zielschiffes. Diese Waffe hat zahlreiche taktische Anwendungen. Zum Beispiel verhindert ein direkter Treffer der EM Pulse, dass Bomber aspektsuchende Sprengköpfe für mehrere Sekunden starten können. Sobald das EMP-Feld abgeklungen ist, müssen sie die Signaturaufschaltung ihres Ziels erst neu erlangen."

1521, "Wir haben Kurs auf Ross 128 gesetzt, dem Ort des Erstkontaktes mit den Shivanern. GTI-Agenten sind in diesem System aktiv gewesen und wir müssen das untersuchen. Ihre Mission wird es sein, die Trümmer des ursprünglichen shivanischen Angriffes zu untersuchen."

1522, "Ross 128 ist gegenwärtig unter shivanischer Kontrolle. Es gibt keine anderen terranischen Streitkräfte in diesem System. Sie müssen Ihre Mission schnell abschließen. Scannen Sie die Trümmer und kehren Sie zur Basis zurück."

1523, "Ihre Staffel hat alle GTI-Schiffe vernichtet. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Wir vermuten, dass der GTI die Trümmer in Ross 128 bereits geborgen haben. Ihre Ziele in diesem System bleiben unbekannt."

GTI-Streitkräfte haben Zugriff auf shivanische Ausrüstungen sowie auch dessen Systeme, die von der Forschungs- und Entwicklungsabteilung entwickelt wurden, so seien Sie darauf hingewiesen, dass Ihr Feind im Besitz überlegender Technologie ist.

Der abtrünnige Galaktisch Terranische Geheimdienst muss niedergeschmettert werden. Diese Verräter bedrohen die Sicherheit der GTA, die Stabilität der terranisch-vasudanischen Allianz und unseren zukünftigen Sieg über die Shivaner. Melden Sie sich für Ihre Missionseinsatzbesprechung, Pilot."

1561, "Aufklärungsflüge haben die Lage der primären GTI-Operationsbasis, die Jotunheim, ausfindig gemacht. Einzelheiten über die Stärke der Garnison sind allerdings lückenhaft. Die GTA wird eine sofortige, umfassende Offensive starten und Verstärkungen so bald wie möglich einsetzen."

1705, "Wir sind die letzte verfügbare Staffel, um bei der Deckung der Hope zu helfen, während sie repariert wird. Die Terraner schicken ein paar ihrer eigenen Jäger, um die Hope zu bewachen, es wird aber einige Zeit dauern, bis sie ankommen."

1706, "Wir glauben nicht, dass die Shivaner genügend Streitkräfte im System haben, um einen ernsthaften Angriff zu starten, aber ihre Strategien sind schwer vorherzusagen. Viel Glück!"

1707,"Gut gemacht, Pilot! Diese Mission war dank der Shivaner intensiver, als wir es erwartet hatten. Glücklicherweise konnten Sie lange genug durchhalten, bis die Verstärkung ankam. Sehr beeindruckend!"

1708, "Für den Schutz einer der wenig verbliebenen vasudanischen Zerstörer der Typhon-Klasse erhalten Sie den Orden für Hervorstechende Tapferkeit. Tragen Sie ihn mit Stolz!"

1741, "Es gab nichts, was Sie hätten tun können, um die Aquilae-Installationsanlage zu retten. Es war zu wenig Zeit und die Lucifer ist zu mächtig."

1742, "Glücklicherweise konnten Sie einige der Fluchtkapseln retten. Die Überlebenden danken Ihnen und freuen sich auf die Gelegenheit, die Zerstörung der Aquilae-Installationsanlage zu rächen."

1743, "Der Schutz aller Fluchtkapseln ist höchst beeindruckend. Die Überlebenden danken Ihnen und hoffen, dass wir die Zerstörung der Aquilae-Installationsanlage rächen können."

1744, "Durch den Schutz des Aquilae Kommunikationsterminals sind wir in der Lage in Kontakt mit unseren Streitkräften in den äußeren Systemen zu bleiben. Der Verlust des Kommunikationsterminals wäre ein schwerer Schlag gewesen. Gut gemacht Pilot!

Für den fortlaufenden Dienst für die Allianz verleihen wir Ihnen den Orden für Gutes Verhalten. Machen Sie weiter so!"

1745, "Wir haben in der Schlacht auch viele Fluchtkapseln verloren. Solch ein Verlust von Leben ist schwer zu ertragen. Mehrere wichtige Wissenschaftler konnten nicht von der Installationsanlage evakuiert werden. Sie und ihre Forschungen werden schmerzlich vermisst werden."

1746, "Du solltest versuchen in der Nähe der Fluchtkapseln zu bleiben und jeden shivanischen Jäger zu zerstören, der sie angreift. Ein oder zwei Kapseln zu opfern, damit der Rest es schaffen kann ist eine weise Entscheidung, die du vielleicht treffen musst."

1747, "Befehle zu verweigern und während der Schlacht abzufliegen ist unentschuldbar. Sie haben bis auf unbestimmte Zeit Flugverbot. Wegtreten!"

1769, "Doch in Altair, was früher vasudanischer Raum war, hat eine Gruppe von vasudanischen Flüchtlingen anscheinend Aufzeichnungen einer schon langen ausgestorbenen Zivilisation ausgegraben. Das terranische Oberkommando glaubt, dass die Informationen in diesen Aufzeichnungen von großer Bedeutung sind."

1770, "Wir haben einen potenziellen Schwachpunkt in der shivanischen Barriere, die uns umgibt, gefunden. Der Altair-Sprungknoten im Deneb-System wird von nur einem Kreuzer, der Zenith, bewacht."

1771, "Die Zenith ist gegenwärtig mit nur zwei Staffeln shivanischer Jäger auf Patrouille. Den Arjuna-Abfängern und den Rama-Überlegenheitsjägern. Allerdings glauben wir, dass sie in der Lage sind, Verstärkungen anzufordern."

1772, "Ihr Primärziel ist es, die Zenith zu zerstören. Schalten Sie zuerst das Kommunikationssystem der Zenith aus, um sie daran zu hindern, Verstärkungen anzufordern. Wenn Sie das nicht tun können, kümmern Sie sich um alle Waffensysteme, einschließlich den Türmen und Raketenwerfern."

1773, "Die Alpha-Staffel wird Deckung für die Bomber geben. Die Gamma-Staffel wird Alpha unterstützen und wird versuchen, das Kommunikationssystem auf der Zenith auszuschalten. Beta wird mit Tsunamis bestückt sein und wird auf vermutete Schwachstellen auf der Hülle der Zenith zielen."

1774, "Sie haben dabei versagt, die Zenith zu zerstören! Wir werden ziemlich viele Schwierigkeiten haben, diese Operation fortzusetzen."

1775, "Wenn ihr die Zenith nicht schlagen könnt, versucht erst alle Dragons im Gebiet zu eliminieren, dann kümmert euch direkt um die Kommunikation der Zenith. Sobald die Kommunikation ausgeschaltet ist, zielt auf das Waffensystem und ermöglicht es damit euren Bombern, sie fertig zu machen."

1794, "Die Omega-Staffel wird mit der Rosetta andocken, sobald sie ankommen. Überwachen Sie diesen Personaltransfer und eskortieren Sie dann Omega 1 und 2 zum Sprungknoten."

1795, "Sie haben es geschafft beide Transporter in das Altair-System zu bringen. Wenn die Informationen bei Altair IV sich als so wertvoll erweisen, wie die vasudanischen Flüchtlinge vermuten, dann werden sowohl Terraner wie auch Vasudaner tief in Ihrer Schuld stehen. Gut gemacht, Pilot!"

1796, "Ein wichtiger Transporter ging verloren. Wir hoffen, dass derjenige, der es geschafft hat durchzukommen, ausreichen wird, um die Informationen von Altair IV zu bergen. Wir haben uns darauf verlassen, dass Sie einen sicheren Flug der Wissenschaftler gewährleisten und Sie waren dabei nur unwesentlich erfolgreich. Wir erwarten in Zukunft besseres von Ihnen!"

1797, "Vergiss die Rosetta! Diese beiden Transporter funktionsfähig rauszubringen ist weit wichtiger. Du musst die schweren Angriffsjäger der Basilisk-Klasse so schnell wie möglich ausschalten, bevor sie ihre Ströme an Schwarmraketen abfeuern können!"

1798, "Beide Transporter wurden zerstört. Sie wurden mit einer Mission von enormer Wichtigkeit betraut und haben dabei versagt. Wegtreten!"

1799, "Vergiss die Rosetta! Konzentriere dich auf die Sicherung dieser Transporter. Schieße die Basilisks so schnell wie möglich ab, es sei denn du willst, dass Omega alle Arten von Raketen zum Abendessen ausprobieren. Vergewissere dich, dass alle deine Staffelpiloten unter deiner Kontrolle stehen. Du musst sicherstellen, dass jeder Jäger seine Arbeit tut."

1800, "Die Besatzung der Rosetta sendet Ihnen ihren Dank. Als die Lucifer reinsprang, haben sie die Hoffnungen aufs Überleben aufgegeben. Ihr Geschwader war in der Lage, den Gegner lange genug aufzuhalten und das ist höchst beeindruckend. Dafür wird Ihnen die Belobigungsmedaille verliehen."

1825, "Unglücklicherweise wird das Altair-System noch immer vom Hammer des Lichts kontrolliert. Eines ihrer Flaggschiffe, die Anvil, ist hier stationiert und hat von unserer Anwesenheit in diesem System erfahren. Sie blockiert derzeit den Anflugkurs zum Subraumknoten."

1826, "Die Anvil beherbergt ein starkes Kontingent von vasudanischen Jägern. Der Geheimdienst berichtet von zwei Geschwadern: Eins mit fortgeschrittenen Raumüberlegenheitsjägern der Thoth-Klasse und eins mit Horus-Abfängern. Diese Jäger haben die Anvil bisher gut verteidigt."

1827, "Der Geheimdienst hat auch die Anwesenheit einer dritten Staffel in diesem System in Form von vasudanischen Bombern entdeckt. Sie werden zweifellos versuchen, unsere fliehenden Transporter anzugreifen."

1828, "Der Geheimdienst hat auch die Anwesenheit einer dritten Staffel in diesem System in Form von vasudanischen Bombern entdeckt. Sie werden zweifellos versuchen, unseren fliehenden Transporter anzugreifen."

1829, "Ihre Angriffsstreitmacht wird ein weiteres Mal aus den Staffeln Alpha, Beta und Gamma bestehen. Gamma wird Eskorte für Alpha geben, während Alpha die Anvil angreift. Beta wird die Sicherheit von Omega sicherstellen und unsere Jägerüberlegenheit aufrechterhalten."

1830, "Die Anvil muss zerstört werden! Wir bestücken Alpha mit Harbinger. Diese Bomben benötigen eine genaue Platzierung und sorgfältige Manöver, aber sie werden große Schäden bei der Anvil verursachen. Beta und Gamma müssen sichergehen, dass die Harbinger ihr Ziel erreichen."

1831, "Unser Hauptziel ist allerdings, sicherzugehen, dass Omega 1 und 2 den Sprungknoten erreichen. Die Zerstörung der Anvil ist der beste Weg sicherzustellen, dass dieses Ziel erreicht wird. Diese Mission ist von großer Bedeutung. Versagen Sie nicht, Pilot! Viel Glück."

1832, "Unser Hauptziel ist allerdings, sicherzugehen, dass Omega 1 den Sprungknoten erreicht. Die Zerstörung der Anvil ist der beste Weg sicherzustellen, dass dieses Ziel erreicht wird. Diese Mission ist von großer Bedeutung. Versagen Sie nicht, Pilot! Viel Glück."

1833, "Sie haben beide Transporter verloren! Das ist eine Katastrophe! Das terranische Oberkommando hat diese Mission als unsere letzte Hoffnung gesehen. Die Lucifer ist dabei, in den Sprungknoten nach Sol einzufliegen und wir haben keine Mittel, sie aufzuhalten.

Es gibt nichts, was wir von hier aus tun können.
Wegtreten!"

1834, "Lasse im schlimmsten Fall zu, dass Omega 2 abgeschossen wird und kümmere dich direkt um die Leo-Bomber. Sobald du die erste Welle von Leo zerstört hast, kannst du einfach jedem Befehlen Jäger anzugreifen und du solltest wenige Probleme haben, Omega 1 zum Sprungknoten zu eskortieren."

1835, "Mission erfüllt, Pilot! Wir wurden noch nicht über die volle Bedeutung der alten Aufzeichnungen instruiert, aber das terranische Oberkommando ist sehr erfreut. Weitere Befehle werden bald erwartet."

1836, "Zumindest konnten wir einen der Transporter retten. Wir haben die Hälfte der Daten verloren, aber die Hälfte, die sie gerettet haben, könnte genug sein. Unter normalen Umständen hätten wir Sie dafür gerügt, Pilot! Aber unter diesen Umständen haben wir keine andere Wahl, als Sie zurück in den Kampf zu schicken. Der letzte Konflikt steht bevor.  Alle unsere Streitkräfte sammeln sich für einen letzten Gegenschlag."

1837, "Wenn ihr Probleme dabei habt, beide Transporter funktionsfähig zu halten, behaltet dies im Hinterkopf: Das Leo-Geschwader besteht nur aus 4 Bombern. Zerstört sie so schnell wie möglich und ihr müsst euch um Omega 1 keine Sorgen mehr machen. Wenn ihr den Typhon nicht zerstören könnt, versucht zumindest ihn mit Disruptor-Raketen auszuschalten, während Omega 2 vorbeifliegt."

1838, "Es ist beeindruckend, dass Sie in der Lage waren eines der Hauptflaggschiffe des Hammer des Lichts zu zerstören. Vielleicht wird dies ihren Widerstand beenden. Der Kampf gegen den Hammer des Lichts war eine große Belastung für die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz."

1855, "Es wird 5 Wellen an shivanischen Gegnern geben. Jede Welle wird aus 3 bis 6 Gruppen an gegnerischen Schiffen bestehen. Nach Abschluss der letzten Welle, haben Sie den Spießrutenlauf beendet. Gelingt Ihnen das, werden Sie ein gewisses Maß an Ehre innerhalb der Verteidigungsliga erhalten. Viel Glück, Pilot!"

1856, "Während Sie in der Lage waren, die erste Stufe der shivanischen Gegner zu überleben, waren Sie nicht in der Lage, die Herausforderung zu meistern, die Ihnen durch die anderen Wellen gestellt wurde. Ihre Leistung war die, die wir von einem Anfänger direkt frisch von der Akademie erwarten würden. Wenn Sie so fliegen, dann beten Sie, dass Sie einen Schreibtischjob bekommen."

1857, "Sie waren in der Lage zwei Stufen an shivanischen Gegnern zu überleben, bevor Sie aus dem Spießrutenlauf abgeflogen sind. Für einen Reservepiloten der Allianz wäre dies eine gerade noch zufriedenstellende Leistung gewesen. Sie brauchen sich über Ihre Arbeit aber keine Sorgen machen. Die Allianz braucht immer Kanonenfutter."

1858, "Sie haben drei Stufen an shivanische Jäger erobert, bevor Sie eine Niederlage erlitten haben. Sie haben gut und ehrenvoll gekämpft. Wenn Ihnen jemals die Abenteuerlust packt, können Sie versuchen, alle Schiffe im Spießrutenlauf zu besiegen. Gut gemacht, Pilot!"

1859, "Sie haben fast den kompletten Spießrutenlauf geschafft, Pilot. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Nur sehr wenige Piloten werden je in der Lage sein, Ihre Leistung nachzuahmen. Vielleicht ziehen Sie in Betracht irgendwann in der Zukunft die letzte Herausforderung dieses Spießrutenlaufs anzugehen. Wegtreten!"

1860, "Sie haben den Spießrutenlauf erfolgreich abgeschlossen, Pilot! Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Um Ihre Fähigkeiten als Jägerpilot anzuerkennen, wird Sie die Allianz in furchtbar riskante und gefährliche Kampfsituationen schicken. Solange die Shivaner uns bedrohen, werden Sie da sein und unsere Streitkräfte sowohl zum Sieg, wie auch zum glorreichen Tod führen.

1869, "Während der große Krieg wütet, werden Sie vom GTI (Galaktisch Terranischer Geheimdienst) für spezielle Geheimoperation beauftragt. In einer Angelegenheit der galaktischen Sicherheit, wurden Sie gebeten, hinter die feindlichen Linien zu fliegen, um den zerbrechlichen Weltraumvertrag zu bewahren. Verbreiten die Shivaner ihre böse Wut oder versucht der GTI sie hereinzulegen?

Operation Thresher im Antares-System verlief nicht so, wie geplant. Das terranische Oberkommando schätzt die terranischen Verluste auf 504 toten, sowie vierzehn vermissten und vermutlich toten Piloten.

Die vasudanische Stellung auf Vasuda Prime und dem Subraumknoten bleibt stabil. Allerdings wurden ihre Versorgungslinien abgeschnitten, was bedeutet, dass es ihnen höchstwahrscheinlich an Verstärkungen und Vorräten mangelt.

Erwarten Sie mehr Nachrichten an dieser Front in der morgigen Besprechung."

Es gibt keinen Platz für Sie in der GTA. Sie können wegtreten."

1877, "Wenn du die vasudanischen Jäger abschießt, bevor sie die Orff erreichen, sind sie nicht in der Lage sie zu beschädigen. Konzentriere dich nur auf einen Jäger zur gleichen Zeit. Wenn dieser zerstört ist, nimm dir den nächsten vor."

1878, "Trotz Ihrer Bemühungen sind vasudanische Jäger dem System entkommen. Wenn wir ihnen erlauben, uns zu entkommen, erscheinen wir schwach, Pilot. Wir werden diese Art der Peinlichkeit kein weiteres Mal tolerieren."

1879, "Wenn du Probleme hast, die Vasudaner abzuschießen, versuche Raketen zu starten. MX-50 suchen automatisch ein feindliches Ziel, welches in Reichweite ist."

1891, "Es gab eine Reihe jüngster Angriffe der Vasudaner im Betelgeuse-System. Sie haben Stoßangriffe auf terranische Konvois durchgeführt, die sich auf dem Weg zum Betelgeuse-Antares Sprungpunkt befanden. Die vasudanischen Angriffe wurden von einem nahegelegenen Asteroidenfeld aus durchgeführt."

1892, "Der terranische Geheimdienst ist sich sicher, dass vier kleine Angriffsstaffeln für die Angriffe auf unsere Konvois verantwortlich sind. Es gab auch Berichte über ein vasudanisches Ass, welches einen der Jäger der Seth-Klasse in diesem Gebiet fliegt."

1893, "Der terranische Geheimdienst ist sich sicher, dass vier kleine Angriffsstaffeln für die Angriffe auf unsere Konvois verantwortlich sind."

1894, "Sie sollen das Asteroidenfeld säubern und die vier vasudanischen Angriffsstaffeln ausschalten. Seien Sie sich bewusst, dass die Asteroiden Störungen bei Ihren Sensoren verursachen werden. Sie werden nicht in der Lage sein, die Vasudaner zu erfassen, bis Sie nahe genug sind, allerdings werden diese Sie auch nicht sehen."

1895, "Wenn Sie dem vasudanischen Ass begegnen, entscheiden Sie im eigenen Ermessen, ob Sie ihn angreifen oder nicht. Denken Sie daran, dass es Ihr primäres Ziel ist, die vier Angriffsstaffeln auszuschalten. Überprüfen Sie Ihre Bestückungen und starten Sie, wenn Sie bereit sind."

1896, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Durch die Zerstörung der vasudanischen Angriffsstaffeln haben Sie dabei geholfen, sicherzugehen, dass es unsere Konvois durch diesen Sprungknoten schaffen werden."

1897, "Die Abfertigung des vasudanischen Asses zeigte hervorragende Fähigkeiten, Pilot. Sie und Ihr Geschwader sind zu loben."

Wir brauchen Ergebnisse von Piloten wie Ihnen, wenn wir erwarten wollen, dass wir in diesen Systemen eine Stellung halten können. Wegtreten!"

1900, "Fliege nicht zu weit vor deinen Staffelpiloten oder sie werden nicht in der Lage sein, dich zu unterstützen. Wenn du in Schwierigkeiten gerätst, verwende das Kommunikationsmenü um Deckung zu fordern.

Frühzeitig Raketen gegen die Vasudaner einzusetzen, kann es leichter machen, sie mit Kanonen auszuschalten.

Wenn du Schwierigkeiten dabei hast, die Vasudaner zu finden, versuche in deren allgemeine Nähe zu gelangen, indem du deinem Radar folgst. Wenn du lange genug wartest, werden sie wahrscheinlich zu dir kommen."

1901, "Wir verstehen, dass Sie das vasudanische Ass nicht angegriffen haben. Angesichts der Fähigkeiten Ihres Gegners ist es nur zu verständlich. Dennoch wäre es ein Schlag für die Moral der Vasudaner gewesen, wenn er geschlagen worden wäre."

1924, "Der Inhalt der Frachtbehälter ist unbekannt. Aufgrund der ungewöhnlichen Aktivität vermutet der GTI-Nachrichtendienst, dass sie militärischen Wert haben."

1925, "Sie werden diese Mission mit der Epsilon-Staffel des 3. Geschwaders fliegen. Die Delta-Staffel steht bei Bedarf als Verstärkung zur Verfügung. Wenn Sie in Schwierigkeiten geraten, zögern Sie nicht, sie anzufordern."

1926, "Aufklärungsmissionen haben festgestellt, dass es üblicherweise zwei Staffeln an vasudanischen Jägern gibt, die das Depot bewachen. Diese Jäger sind Ihre Hauptsorge."

1927, "Aufklärer haben auch festgestellt, dass dieses Depot stark verwendet wird. Die Kontrolle darüber wird vasudanische Angriffe von diesem System aus ernsthaft einschränken."

1928, "Es ist wahrscheinlich, dass es Frachter im Gebiet geben wird, die Fracht transportieren. Alle vasudanischen Schiffe müssen zerstört werden! Keiner darf entkommen, da diese sicherlich Verstärkungen herbringen würden."

1929, "Erwarten Sie, bewaffnete Frachter im Gebiet vorzufinden, die Fracht transportieren. Alle vasudanischen Schiffe müssen zerstört werden! Keiner darf entkommen, da diese sicherlich Verstärkungen herbringen würden."

1930, "Sobald Sie das Gebiet gesichert haben, wird die $f GTC $f Orff eintreffen und die Wache über den Außenposten übernehmen. Viel Glück, Pilot. GTA-Command, Ende."

1931, "Die Zerstörung der vasudanischen Jäger war sehr wichtig. Nicht nur haben wir die Kontrolle über dieses Depot gewonnen, sondern wir haben den Vasudanern in diesem System gezeigt, dass mit uns nicht zu spaßen ist."

1932, "Die Beseitigung der vasudanischen Frachter wird den Transport von notwenigen Vorräten zu ihren Streitkräften in diesem System einschränken."

1933, "Die gesamte vasudanische Fracht wurde gekapert und zu unserer Basis gebracht. Der Nachrichtendienst wird diese untersuchen."

1934, "Es scheint, dass zwischen der Fracht ein paar gestohlene Waffenprototypen waren. Wir hatten befürchtet, dass die Vasudaner sie bereits gefunden und aus diesem Gebiet geschafft hatten. Die Wiedererlangung der Waffen wäre ein großer Sieg gewesen.

Leider wurde der Inhalt dieser Fracht von einem Verräter gestohlen, der den Transporter Omega flog. Diese Prototypen müssen zurückgeholt werden!"

1935, "Aufgrund, dass die vasudanischen Frachter entkommen sind, können wir davon ausgehen, dass Ihre Streitkräfte in Alarmbereitschaft versetzt wurden. Das ist ein ernsthafter Fehlschlag, Pilot."

1936, "Konzentriere dich auf den Abschuss der Frachter, bevor sie die Gelegenheit haben abzufliegen. Es mag weise sein, deine Staffelpiloten zu befehlen, einen anzugreifen, während du den anderen ausschaltest."

1937, "Manche der Frachtbehälter gingen in dem Gefecht verloren. Die Bergungsmannschaften haben geborgen, was sie konnten. Die GTA wird den Inhalt der Behälter untersuchen, in der Hoffnung, dass sich dieser für uns im Krieg als hilfreich erweist."

1938, "Passe auf, wenn du in der Nähe der Behälter feuerst. Verstreute Schüsse können die zerbrechliche Fracht leicht zerstören."

1939, "Es scheint, dass nicht viele vasudanische Verstärkungen verfügbar waren. Es ist ein Glück, dass Sie in der Lage waren, diese zu zerstören."

1940, "Es scheint, dass der terranische Elysium-Transporter namens Omega den Inhalt eines der Behälter wegschleppte. Wir sind uns nicht sicher, wer an Bord des Transporters war, aber der Geheimdienst vermutet, dass es eine Gruppe von abtrünnigen Menschen ist. Wir versuchen gerade, den Transporter zu lokalisieren."

1941, "Achte sorgfältig auf Omega. Zu wissen, was der Transporter macht, könnte sehr nützlich sein."

1942, "Ihnen wurde befohlen, das Gebiet zu sichern, bis die GTC Orff eintrifft. Sie haben versagt! Die GTA wäre besser dran, wenn sie Ihnen und Ihrer Staffel Schreibtischarbeit geben würde."

$b Hauptmann $b McCarthy

Das terranische Oberkommando hat uns darüber informiert, dass Hauptmann Alex McCarthy, ehemals an Bord der GTD Intrepid stationiert, gemeinsam mit einer unbekannten Anzahl an Jägern und mehreren Mitarbeitern zu den Vasudanern übergelaufen ist.

Er hat es auch geschafft, die Pläne für die Avenger-Prototypkanone zu stehlen. Diese müssen sofort zurückgebracht werden.

Vasudanische Agenten unter terranischer Kontrolle haben Informationen über McCarthys Pläne im Antares-System gestreut. Da sich die Galatea bereits in Antares befindet, wurden wir angewiesen, einen Angriff auf die Streitkräfte von McCarthy anzuführen."

1975, "$b Umgang $b mit $b Verrätern

Diese Operation wird nach Schema F durchgeführt. Verräter der terranischen Sache sind nicht zu tolerieren. McCarthy wird als Beispiel dienen, wenn er reingebracht wird."

1976, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTF $b Valkyrie

Die Galatea hat einen vollständigen Satz von den neuen Valkyrie-Abfangjägern erhalten.

Einige von Ihnen erinnern sich vielleicht noch an den Angel-Aufklärungsjäger. Dieser wurde komplett verändert und mit zwei zusätzlichen Antrieben ausgestattet, was ihn zum schnellsten Jäger in der Flotte macht. Dieser wurde als Valkyrie neu benannt. Sie sollte es Ihnen ermöglichen kurzen Prozess mit gegnerischen Jägern zu machen.

Melden Sie sich in zwanzig Minuten zur Missionseinsatzbesprechung."

1977, "Pläne für den Avenger-Waffenprototypen wurden von Hauptmann McCarthy gestohlen. Sein Transporter wurde hier in Antares entdeckt. Er wird als $h Omega bezeichnet."

1978, "Einer von McCarthys Komplizen wurde gefangen genommen und hat seine Absichten mit den gestohlenen Plänen offenbart. Nicht wirklich überraschend, beabsichtigt McCarthy die Avenger an die Vasudaner zu verkaufen. Sein vasudanischer Kontakt wird als $h Rasputin bezeichnet."

1979, "Ihr Geschwader wird ankommen, bevor der Austausch durchgeführt wird. Sie sollen alle feindlichen Jäger zerstören, inklusive aller abtrünnigen Terraner. Allerdings wollen wir McCarthy lebendig. Ihre Schiffe wurden mit Disruptors ausgestattet, die dafür geeignet sind, die Antriebe von Omega zu deaktivieren."

1980, "Alpha- und Beta-Staffel, die jeweils aus vier Jägern bestehen, werden geschickt, um diese Mission auszuführen. Sie werden in etwa sechs Kilometer Entfernung zum Ort des Austauschs springen. Gelangen Sie, so schnell wie möglich, zur Omega." 

1981, "Erwarten Sie erheblichen Widerstand. Die Beta-Staffel wird sich darauf konzentrieren, die vasudanischen Streitkräfte anzugreifen. Von der Alpha-Staffel wird erwartet, Omega auszuschalten. Fordern Sie bei Bedarf die Untersützung der Beta-Staffel an."

1982, "Nachdem McCarthys Transporter deaktiviert wurde, wird die $f GTT $f Comet ins Gebiet springen, um mit dem Transporter anzudocken. Sie sollen die Sicherheit der Comet sicherstellen, insbesondere während des Andockvorgangs mit der Omega."

1983, "Nachdem die Comet und die Omega das Gebiet verlassen haben, liegt es in Ihrer Verantwortung alle verbliebende Feinde zu eliminieren. Sobald das Gebiet gesichert ist, springen Sie zur Galatea zurück."

1984, "Beachten Sie, dass es nötig sein wird, dass Sie terranische Piloten angreifen. Diese Piloten sind Verräter der Allianz und denen sollte keine Gnade gegeben werden. Tausende an Leben stehen auf dem Spiel. Zögern Sie nicht, tödliche Mittel gegen die Verräter einzusetzen. Sie sind Ihr Gegner!"

1985, "Falls Sie auf bedeutenden Widerstand stoßen oder schwere Verluste erleiden, wird die $f Delta$| -Staffel von Command zur Unterstützung geschickt. Sollte weitere Hilfe benötigt werden, fordern Sie auch nach der $f Epsilon$| -Staffel. Viel Glück, Pilot."

1986, "Wir wollten McCarthy lebendig gefangen nehmen, Pilot. Die fehlende Kontrolle über Ihr Geschwader ist beunruhigend. Wir sind damit nicht zufrieden."

1987, "Stelle sicher, dass du deine Disruptors verwendest, wenn du versuchst McCarthy zu deaktivieren. Sie verursacht minimalen Schaden auf einer Schiffshülle, während sie normalen Schaden auf ihre Elektronik und Subsystemen verursacht. Sobald Omega deaktiviert ist, könnten feindliche Schiffe versuchen, sie zu zerstören. Gehe sicher, dass sie das nicht tun."

1988, "Wir waren in der Lage den Avengerprototypen wiederzuerlangen. Gute Arbeit! McCarthy wurde verhaftet und wird bald vor Gericht gestellt werden."

1989, "Wir waren nicht in der Lage den gestohlenen Avengerprototypen wiederzuerlangen. Dies war Ihr Primärziel und Sie haben dabei versagt.

Die Vasudaner werden sie sicherlich in zukünftigen Begegnungen gegen uns einsetzen."

1990, "Stelle sicher, dass du die Omega so schnell wie möglich deaktivierst, um den Prototypen zurückzuerlangen. Sobald die Antriebe der Omega zerstört wurden, wird die GTT Comet eintreffen und die Omega kapern."

1991, "Diese Sektion wurde entfernt!"

1992, "Der Geheimdienst hat uns mitgeteilt, dass Sie bedacht agiert haben und in der Lage waren, die Rasputin zu deaktivieren. Wichtiges vasudanisches Personal war an Bord und deren Gefangennahme wird uns in unserer Sache unterstützen.

Dies war von Ihnen eine kluge Entscheidung und Sie sind für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit zu loben.

Der Geheimdienst hat angefordert, dass Ihnen für Ihren Teil der Gefangennahme eine Belobigungsmedaille vergeben wird."

1993, "Unglücklicherweise ist uns die Rasputin entkommen. Das ist kein großer Verlust, aber jeder Vasudaner, der uns entkommt, wird uns auf lange Sicht Leben kosten."

1994, "Gegnerische Transporter auszuschalten ist immer eine gute Idee. Aber dir stehen mehr Optionen als nur die Zerstörung zur Verfügung."

1995, "Die Rasputin und ihre gesamte Ladung wurde zerstört. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass wichtiges vasudanisches Personal an Bord war."

2026, "Die Aufklärung hat festgestellt, dass nur noch ein vasudanischer Kreuzer im System geblieben ist, die $h Taurus$| . Wenn sich die Vasudaner für einen Angriff auf die $f Pato, auf ihrem Weg nach Ribos, entscheiden, werden sie sicherlich die $h Taurus verwenden."

2027, "Die Anzahl der vasudanischen Angriffsschiffe in diesem System ist minimal. Die Aufklärung schätzt höchstens zwei Stoßangriffgeschwader. Sollte etwas falsch laufen, ist die $f Plato mit einer $f Fluchtkapsel ausgerüstet. Die Fluchtkapsel wird versuchen, den Sprung nach Ribos durchzuführen."

2034, "Der Geheimdienst hat die Daten untersucht, die Sie aus der versuchten visuellen Identifikation geliefert haben. Es gibt keinerlei Aufzeichnungen über solche Schiffe. Sie scheinen nicht Vasudanisch zu sein. Die Schlussfolgerung ist, dass sie einer neuen Spezies angehören.

Aber die größte Sorge sind ihre Waffen. Sie sind stärker als alles im Arsenal der GTA oder der PVN.

Wir glauben, dass die Daten, die Sie gesammelt haben, sich als wertvoll dabei erweisen werden, eine Schwäche in diesem neuen Gegner zu entdecken."

2035, "Es ist bedauerlich, dass Sie nicht in der Lage waren, eine visuelle Identifikation der unbekannten Schiffe zu erhalten. Während der nachfolgenden Angriffe, konnte der Geheimdienst nur begrenzte Informationen sammeln.

Die Schiffe sind von unseren Sensoren nicht zu entdecken. Schlimmer noch, sie scheinen irgendeine Art von Energieschildsystem zu haben, dass sie gegen unsere Angriffe fast unempfindlich macht.

Wir sind zuversichtlich, dass unsere Wissenschaftler bald eine Schwäche in diesen neuen Gegnern entdecken werden."

Das terranische Oberkommando hat die Existenz einer neuen Spezies bestätigt. Bis weiterer Kontakt hergestellt wurde, hat das Oberkommando sie als $quoteShivaner$quote bezeichnet.

Die Shivaner haben in den Systemen Beta Cgyni und Vega sowohl bei den terranischen, wie auch vasudanischen Streitkräften große Opfer verursacht und scheinen einen schnellen Vorstoß in andere wichtige Systeme entlang der terranisch-vasudanischen Front durchzuführen. Wir haben jeglichen Kontakt zu unseren Streitkräften in den Systemen Ikeya und Ross 128 verloren."

Erwarten Sie, diesbezüglich heute später mehr vom terranischen Oberkommando zu hören."

Alle shivanischen Streitkräfte sollten als eine ernsthafte Bedrohung betrachtet werden.

Sie sind berechtigt, jedes shivanisches Schiff anzugreifen, das Ihren Missionszielen im Weg steht.

2069, "$b Shivanische $b Technologien

Das wenige, was über die shivanische Technologie in Erfahrung gebracht wurde, betrifft Ihr Jäger Schutzschildsystem. Dieses Schildsystem macht sie für unsere ML-16 nahezu undurchdringlich.

Die F&E verändert gegenwärtig den Avenger-Prototypen, um ihn nützlicher gegen die Schilde zu machen.

Darüber hinaus können unsere Jäger ihre Schiffe, aufgrund unserer fehlenden Daten über die shivanischen Elektroniksystemen, nicht erfassen. Gegenwärtig sind Pläne in der Erschaffung, um diese Situation zu beheben."

2070, "$b Befehle

Der terranische Geheimdienst arbeitet rund um die Uhr, um uns weitere Informationen zu geben.

Bis dahin wurde uns befohlen, in das $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System zu fliegen und dort jede Aktivität zu überwachen."

2071, "Aufgrund der erhöhten Begegnungen mit shivanischen Streitkräften, hat das terranische Oberkommando die Galatea ins $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System befohlen, um die shivanischen Aktivitäten zu überwachen. Die Galatea hat seit ihrer letzten Reparatur ziemliche Schäden genommen und es ist nicht die Zeit, um dem sichersten Weg zu folgen."

2072, "Der $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-Sprungknoten im Antares-System liegt in der Mitte eines dichten Asteroidenfeldes und ist damit einer der am wenigsten verwendeten Sprungknoten in der Galaxis. Das Standardverfahren würde uns diesen Knoten vollkommen umfliegen lassen und zwei Sprünge erfordern. Jetzt haben wir aber keine Wahl."

2073, "Das Waffensubsystem hat durch gegnerische Bomber Schaden genommen. Die Galatea sollte dennoch in der Lage sein, es durch das Asteroidenfeld zu schaffen, aber trotzdem wird die Alpha-Staffel eingesetzt, um sich nährende Asteroiden zu zerstören."

2077, "Im Falle eines gegnerischen Angriffes sollen Sie die Flucht der Galatea aus dem System um jeden Preis decken."

2078, "Das Zurücklassen der Galatea in einem Asteroiden war ein unerklärlicher Akt der Feigheit. Die Galatea wurde zerstört und es ist Ihre schuld! Sie sind hiermit von allen Rängen und Pflichten entbunden."

2079, "Bleibe im Gebiet, bis die Galatea abfliegen kann. Wenn du Schwierigkeiten hast, lange genug am Leben zu bleiben, versuche langsamer zu fliegen und verwende die Schubkontrolle um deine Geschwindigkeit zu kontrollieren. Asteroiden sind oft viel weiter entfernt, als sie scheinen."

2080, "Die Vernichtung der Galatea ist ein großer Verlust für die terranische Allianz. Tausende an Leben gingen wegen Ihrer schlechten Missionsausführung verloren. Vielleicht hätte man dieser Aufgabe einem erfahreneren Piloten geben sollen. 

Sie sind hiermit von allen Rängen und Pflichten innerhalb der GTA entbunden."

2081, "Wenn die Galatea zu viele Asteroidentreffer erhält, wird sie die Mission nicht überstehen. Konzentriere dich auf die Asteroiden mit den weißen Zielerfassungsklammern. Die Türme der Galatea werden ebenfalls auf die Asteroiden feuern. Verschwende keine Zeit mit denen, auf die die Galatea schießt.

Achte besonders auf das Gebiet rund um den Subraumknoten. Asteroiden in diesem Gebiet stellen eine größere Bedrohung für die Galatea dar.

Wenn die Galatea von den Shivanern zerstört wird, versuche ihre Bomben abzuschießen, nachdem sie gestartet wurden."

2082, "Die Galatea hat es nach Beta Cygni geschafft, aber unsere Berichte zeigen, dass sie ernsthafte Schäden erlitten hat. Sie wird für mindestens drei Tage in Reparatur sein.

Es ist schade, dass Sie sie nicht besser schützen konnten, aber was geschehen ist, ist geschehen. Melden Sie sich zur Einsatzbesprechung um 08:00 Uhr."

2083, "Sie vor jeden Asteroiden zu schützen ist vielleicht nicht möglich, aber du solltest versuchen, die Galatea auf über 50% Hüllenstatus zu halten.

Der Geheimdienst hat festgestellt, dass mindestens einer der shivanischen Eintrittspunkte im Ikeya-System liegt."

2104, "Mindestens fünf Frachtdepots unbekannten Ursprungs wurden in Ikeya entdeckt. Diese Frachtformationen sind anders als jede vasudanische und terranische Formation und man ist daher davon überzeugt, dass sie zu den Shivanern gehören."

2105, "Aufklärungsflüge haben gezeigt, dass das Depot von sechs Wachgeschützen beschützt ist, die sich an den Außenkanten befinden. Dieses Depot bietet eine erstklassige Gelegenheit, mehr Informationen über die Shivaner zu sammeln. Deren offensiven Aktivitäten in diesem System sind minimal und wir glauben nicht, dass sie einen ernsthaften Versuch unternehmen werden, dieses Depot zu verteidigen."

2106, "Langstreckenscanner zeigen an, dass einige dieser Frachtbehälter ungewöhnliche Elektronik beinhalten. Sie scheint ähnlich der zu sein, die die Shivaner für ihre Schildtechnologie verwenden. Ein Kurzstreckenscan dieser Behälter ist das Primärziel in dieser Operation."

2107, "Weitere Aufklärungsflüge haben gezeigt, dass eine andere Behältergruppe Teile für eine shivanische Sensoraufstellung beinhalten könnten. Ein Kurzstreckenscan dieser Gruppe sollte entscheidende Daten liefern, die nötig sind, um die Schiffssensoren anzupassen, damit eine Radaraufschaltung auf shivanische Jäger erlangt werden kann. Das Scannen dieser Behälter ist Ihr sekundäres Ziel."

2108, "Sie werden in etwa sechs Kilometern Entfernung zum Frachtdepot reinspringen. Fliegen Sie schnell zum Frachtdepot und beseitigen Sie alle Wachgeschütze. Dies ermöglicht es unseren Frachtern, die Fracht zu sammeln, nachdem Sie sie gescannt haben."

2109, "Von einer Mission wegzuspringen, ohne auch nur einen Versuch zu machen, Ihre Ziele zu erreichen ist eine grobe Fahrlässigkeit, die an Desertation grenzt.

Ihre Anhörung ist für 07:00 Uhr angesetzt."

2110, "Versuche zumindest, deine Ziele zu erreichen. Manchmal ist das alles, was man braucht."

2111, "Trotz der shivanischen Falle, hatten Sie eine Mission zu erledigen. Ihre Befehle waren, in dem Gebiet zu verbleiben, es sei denn Command befiehlt Ihnen den Abflug.

Ihre Missachtung dieser Befehle hat eine hervorragende Gelegenheit verschwendet."

2112, "Sobald die Falle der Shivaner zuschnappt, ist Tarnung keine weitere Option mehr.

Verwende deine Nachbrenner so viel wie möglich und versuche die Frachtbehälter zu scannen. Deine Staffelpiloten werden ihr Möglichstes tun, um dich zu decken."

2113, "Es ist ein Glück, dass Sie der shivanischen Falle entkommen konnten. Ihre Hartnäckigkeit bei der Erlangung der Daten, die wir benötigen, ist lobenswert.

Während Sie nicht in der Lage waren, die Schilddaten zu gewinnen, war eine anderer unserer Einsatzverbände in der Lage, diese zu erwerben.

Die Daten, die Sie über die shivanische Sensortechnologie erhalten konnten, werden bei der Bekämpfung shivanischer Streitkräfte von entscheidender Bedeutung sein. Unsere Techniker sind jetzt davon überzeugt, dass Sie in der Lage sein werden eine Zielauflösung für shivanische Schiffe zu implementieren.

Gute Arbeit, Pilot!"

2114, "Die Shivaner beschützten die Schildtechnologie zu gut. Es gab nichts, was du hättest tun können, um sie zu erhalten."

2115, "Ihr Erfolg beim Erwerb der Schildtechnologie trotz solcher Übermacht, hat uns darauf hingewiesen, dass sie, in Wirklichkeit, mit den Shivanern zusammenarbeiten. Ihr Verhör ist für 09:30 Uhr angesetzt. Sie werden zur Arrestzelle begleitet."

2133, "Ja, das fühlt sich nicht richtig an."

2134, "Halten Sie Funkstille, Piloten. Sie haben eine Arbeit zu erledigen."

2135, "Ich mag das nicht!"

2136, "Der Großteil der Fracht wurde verloren."

2137, "Scannen Sie die restliche Fracht, wir brauchen weiterhin alle verfügbaren Daten."

$b Waffenstillstand

Die GTA hat mit den Vasudanern einen Waffenstillstand und einen Nichtangriffspakt unterzeichnet. Das Oberkommando hat bereits große Erleichterung geäußert, vor allem wegen der enormen Belastung von militärischen und wirtschaftlichen Ressourcen, die der Krieg in den letzten Jahren verursacht hat.

Das Ende eines 14-jährigen Krieges sollte Frieden bringen. Leider gibt es keine Zeit, sich zu entspannen.

Nachdem die 3. Flotte die GTD Amadeus im Vega-System verloren hat, haben sowohl die GTA als auch das vasudanische Parlament den shivanischen Streitkräften offen den Krieg erklärt."

2143, "$b Vasudanische $b Abweichler

Leider haben nicht alle vasudanischen Streitkräfte dem Waffenstillstand zugestimmt. Es wurden Berichte empfangen, die von Angriffen einer abtrünnigen Gruppe an Vasudanern sprechen, die sich selbst $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote nennen.

Der Hammer des Lichts, mit der Kurzform HoL, scheint die shivanische Sache vorsätzlich zu unterstützen und bezieht sich dabei auf eine vasudanische Legende über die Ankunft einer allmächtigen Rasse.

Wenn Sie irgendwelchen HoL-Streitkräften begegnen, sollten Sie sie als feindlich behandeln und jedes nötige Mittel einsetzen, um sie zu neutralisieren."

2144, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b Shivanische $b Verfolgung

Mit den wichtigen Daten, die von der Bastion im Ikeya-Depot gesammelt wurden, wissen unsere Techniker genug über die shivanische Technologie, um erfolgreich ihre Schiffe zu erfassen. Sie sollten sie auch auf dem Radar verfolgen können."

2145, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-15 $b Avenger

Die Avenger wird nun auf jedem terranischen und vasudanischen Schiff in der Galaxis bestückt. Sie werden diese Kanonen weitaus wirksamer gegen die shivanischen Schilde finden."

2146, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b Schildsystem

Ein Stoßgeschwader, welches von der 5. Flotte in das Ikeya-System geschickt wurde, war in der Lage, einige shivanische Schildprototypen zu bergen. Voll funktionsfähige Versionen dieser Technologie werden für den Einsatz auf GTA-Jägern entwickelt.

Die Schilde selbst werden durch das $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System ins Ribos-System geschickt. Diese Lieferung muss in Ribos ankommen!

Melden Sie sich in 30 Minuten bei der Missionseinsatzbesprechung."

2147, "Um etwa 14:00 Uhr wurde ein großer Konvoi, welcher einer unserer neu entwickelten Schildprototypen geladen hatte, eingesetzt. Es wurde erwartet, dass die Shivaner den Konvoi angreifen würden."

2148, "Die Shivaner zerstörten den Konvoi. Was die Shivaner aber nicht wissen ist, dass der Konvoi ein Köder war. Es gab insgesamt vier funktionsfähige Prototypen, von denen nur einer zerstört wurde."

2149, "Sie sollen zwei Staffeln an Jägern nehmen, um die restlichen drei Schildprototypen zu eskortieren. Die Shivaner sollten denken, dass Sie nur eine weitere Lieferung für Ribos sind. Dies ist nicht der direkte Weg zur Erde, was die Shivaner von unserer wahren Absicht ablenken sollte."

2150, "Sie sollen die Frachter begleiten, bis die Vasudaner ankommen, um sie auf der zweiten Etappe zu eskortieren. Verlassen Sie die Frachter nicht, bis sie ins Ribos-System gesprungen sind."

2151, "Die Shivaner haben alles, was von dieser Installationsanlage geschickt wurde, getroffen. Erwarten Sie Widerstand. Viele Piloten haben heute ihr Leben verloren, damit die Chancen für den Erfolg auf dieser Mission größer sind. Sie werden es schaffen. Wegtreten."

2152, "Sie haben eine hervorragende Arbeit bei der Verteidigung der Schildprototypen geleistet! Sie waren in der Lage alle drei zu sichern, was uns nicht nur die Technologie gibt, sondern auch dazu beiträgt, ihre Massenproduktion zu beschleunigen.

Ihre Leistung wird in die Geschichte als ein Standard eingehen, nach dem sich zukünftige Piloten richten. Einfach hervorragend, Pilot!

In Anbetracht Ihrer guten Leistung in unserer ersten Operation mit verbündeten Vasudanern, verleihen wir Ihnen den Orden der vasudanischen Allianz."

2153, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Sie konnten zwei der drei Schildprototypen in Sicherheit und auf den Weg zu den Wissenschaftlern auf der Erde bringen.

Ihre Bemühungen heute werden sicherlich die Chancen gegen die Shivaner etwas ausgleichen. Gute Arbeit!"

2154, "Das sichern von zwei Prototypen ist schwierig, aber das Sichern aller drei würde der GTA noch mehr zugutekommen."

2155, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot. Einen der Schildprototypen vor der Zerstörung zu retten, war genau das, worauf gehofft wurde. Sie sollten Stolz auf sich sein."

2156, "Mehr als einen Prototyp zu sichern ist möglich."

2157, "Ihre Unfähigkeit sogar nur einen der Schildprototypen vor der Zerstörung zu bewahren, gibt der GTA wenig Chance, diesen Krieg zu gewinnen.

Sie sind für diesen Fehlschlag verantwortlich!"

2158, "Stelle sicher, dass die Fracht zu jeder Zeit bewacht ist. Lass dich nicht durch Nahkämpfe mit Gegnern weglocken. Greife nur Schiffe an, die die Frachter oder ihre Fracht erfassen."

2159, "Sie haben einen direkten Befehl missachtet, indem Sie versucht haben, diesen vasudanischen Konvoi zu retten! Ihnen wurde gesagt, dass Sie die ganze Zeit bei den Schildprototypen bleiben sollen!

Denken Sie, dass es der ursprüngliche Schildprototyp-Konvoi nicht wert war, gerettet zu werden? Piloten brachten große Opfer, so dass es Ihnen gelingen könnte und dann haben Sie einfach dabei versagt Befehle zu befolgen!

2189, "Ein $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Frachtdepot wurde entdeckt, von dem angenommen wird, dass es das primäre Vorsorgungszentrum für alle $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Aktivitäten im System ist."

2190, "Dieses Depot wird von einer Staffel Seth-Klasse Jäger, sowie von einem Kreuzer der Aten-Klasse, die $h Ramses$| , bewacht. Der Hammer des Lichts hat keine Schildtechnologie, weshalb diese Operation einfach sein sollte."

2191, "Ihr Primärziel ist die Kaperung des Aten-Kreuzers $h Ramses$| . Sie werden ihn mit Disruptors deaktivieren und entwaffnen und anschließend die $f Omega$| -Transporter, während sie den Kreuzer kapern, beschützen."

2193, "Sobald die Ramses deaktiviert und entwaffnet wurde, zerstören Sie jegliche Fracht in dem Gebiet. Es darf dem Hammer des Lichts nicht gestattet werden, sich neu zu versorgen. Die Behälter beinhalten vasudanische Vorräte, die für die GTA nutzlos sind."

2194, "Sie werden die Alpha-Staffel bei dieser Operation anführen. Ihre Schiffe sind mit unserem neuen Schildsystem ausgerüstet. Im Falle von unvorhergesehen Problemen, warten Sie auf weitere Befehle von Command."

2195, "Sie haben die Schlacht verlassen, bevor es irgendeine Gelegenheit gab, die Ramses zu kapern. Waren Ihre Befehle nicht spezifisch genug?

Wegtreten!"

2196, "Versuche alle Ziele zu erreichen und warte dann auf Omega, um die Ramses zu kapern."

2197, "Sie haben die Ramses zerstört! Ihnen wurde befohlen, Sie zu kapern. Das Missachten von Befehlen ist nicht akzeptabel."

2198, "Setze deine Disruptors gegen die Ramses ein, um sie zu deaktivieren und zu entwaffnen."

2199, "Leider hat die Taranis alle Operationen im $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System gestört.

Die Vernichtung der Ramses, obwohl bedauerlich, war nicht Ihre Schuld. Es ist gut, dass Sie die Fracht zerstört haben, bevor die Shivaner in der Lage waren, Sie zu kapern."

2200, "Obwohl die Taranis Sie daran hinderte, die Ramses zu kapern, ist es ein schwerer Schlag für die Sicherheit dieses Systems, dass Sie es den Shivanern ermöglichten, die Fracht zu kapern."

2201, "Wenn du Schwierigkeiten hast, die ganze Fracht zu zerstören, nachdem die Shivaner angekommen sind, versuche ein Teil von ihr zu zerstören, bevor die Shivaner kommen.

Du hast 3 Staffelpiloten. Sicherlich wird nicht jeder von ihnen gebraucht, um die Ramses und die Aries-Staffel zu bekämpfen."

2202, "Die Vernichtung der Frachter, die auf der Flucht waren, ist wichtig. Der Hammer des Lichts wird eine schwierige Zeit haben, ihre $quoteBeta Cgyni$quote-Operationen ohne Vorräte zu beginnen."

2203, "Es ist beunruhigend, dass die $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Jäger jetzt doch die Schildtechnologie haben.

Es scheint, dass diese Rebellion weit größer ist, als wir ursprünglich gehofft hatten."

2204, "Die Vernichtung der Taranis ist ein schwerer Rückschlag. Ihre Kaperung hätte uns eine Fülle an Informationen über die Shivaner liefern können. Ihnen wurde befohlen, den Kreuzer Taranis NICHT anzugreifen, Pilot.

$b Die $b Taranis

Erste Angriffe wurden ohne Probleme durchgeführt und die Taranis befindet sich auf ihrem letzten Schritt. Die Staffeln Delta und Epsilon haben den Großteil der Jägereskorte der Taranis zerstört. Es ist Zeit, die Arbeit zu beenden.

Zu diesem Zweck hat das terranische Oberkommando eine volle Staffel Athena-Bomber geschickt, die mit der neu entwickelten Stiletto bestückt sind."

2225, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTB $b Athena

Die Athena ist unser manövrierfähigste Bomber. Sie trägt eine große Nutzlast und ist in Nahkämpfen doch fast so effektiv, wie ein Jäger."

2226, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTM-43 $b Stiletto

Die Stiletto wurde nun in Sol sorgfältig getestet und ist nun einsatzbereit. Sie kann dazu verwendet werden, Subsysteme auf jedem Schiff zu zerstören und sollte dabei auch wirksamer als die Disruptor sein. Das elektronische Suchgerät sollte ihr Einsatz einfach machen. Einfach zielen und schießen.

Die Zielsuchfähigkeiten der Stiletto sind begrenzt, so stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie vor dem Abschuss einen klaren Schuss bekommen. Die Stiletto sollte besonders bei der Zerstörung der Antriebe und der Waffensysteme der Taranis nützlich sein.

Alle Athena-Bomber werden mit Stilettos bestückt und werden von der Alpha-Staffel geflogen."

2227, "Der Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse namens $h Taranis wurde aus dem $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System zurück ins Ikeya-System gejagt. Sie ist knapp an Vorräten und aufgrund der jüngsten Angriffe nur noch leicht bewacht."

2228, "Der Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse namens $h Taranis hat seinen Gegenangriff begonnen. Obwohl wir die meisten ihrer Jägereskorte zerstört haben, gelang es ihr, ein Reparaturschiff zu suchen. Sie ist jetzt fast voll funktionsfähig."

2229, "Langstreckensensoren zeigen, dass nur noch zwei Jäger und drei Bomber zum Schutz der Taranis übriggeblieben sind."

2230, "Die Taranis fliegt auf den $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-Subraumknoten zu, wo sie sich wohl wieder versorgen wird. Dies gibt uns ein kleines Gelegenheitsfenster, in dem wir einen Schlag durchführen können."

2231, "Die Taranis fliegt auf den $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-Subraumknoten zu, wo wir erwarten, dass sie eine Offensive anführt. Dies gibt uns nur ein kleines Gelegenheitsfenster, indem wir einen Präventivschlag durchführen können."

2232, "Ihr Primärziel ist es, die $h Taranis zu deaktivieren und zu entwaffnen, um ihre Kaperung zu ermöglichen. Dies wird unser erster Versuch sein, ein großes shivanisches Schiff zu kapern. Drei Staffeln werden dieser Aufgabe zugewiesen."

2233, "Die Alpha-Staffel wird Athena-Bomber fliegen. Diese Bomber sind gerade auf der Galatea eingetroffen und sind mit der neuen Stiletto bestückt. Die Stiletto ist in der Lage Subsysteme mit nur einem Treffer zu zerstören. Alphas primäre Aufgabe wird sein, die Taranis zu entwaffnen und zu deaktivieren."

2234, "Die Beta-Staffel ist angewiesen, Alpha zu eskortieren und vor Jägerangriffen zu beschützen. Beta wird Jäger der Apollo-Klasse fliegen."

2235, "Die Gamma-Staffel wird Valkyries fliegen und sollte jeden feindlichen Jäger und Bomber im Gebiet angreifen. Wenn sie anderweitig gebraucht werden, können Sie sie jeder Aufgabe zuweisen, für die Sie sie passend sehen."

2236, "Sobald die Taranis entwaffnet und deaktiviert wurde, werden die $f Omega$| -Transporter ankommen, um sie zu kapern. Wenn die Taranis gekapert wurde, kehren Sie für die Abschlussbesprechung zur Galatea zurück."

2237, "Lassen Sie es nicht zu, dass die $h Taranis entkommt oder zerstört wird.

Viel Glück."

2238, "Der Zweck dieser Mission war es, ein großes shivanisches Schiff für Untersuchungen zu kapern. Dies war für die Kriegsanstrengungen unerlässlich. Ihr Fehlschlag ist unverzeihlich.

Vieleicht werden Sie eines Tages lernen, dass die Konsequenzen Ihrer Handlungen andere beeinflussen. Bis dahin, sind Sie von allen Pflichten entbunden."

2239, "Um die Taranis zu deaktivieren, ohne sie zu zerstören, musst du Waffen einsetzen, die nur sehr wenig Hüllenschaden verursachen. Deine besten Alternativen sind daher wahrscheinlich Stilettos und Disruptors.

Wenn die shivanische Staffel Rama den Kreuzer zerstört, verfolge und lenke sie ab. Verwende deine Staffelpiloten, um sie mit deren Hilfe auszuschalten."

2240, "Die Taranis ist ins $quoteBeta Cygni$quote-System geflüchtet.

Nicht nur ging unsere Chance verloren, einen shivanischen Kreuzer zu kapern, sondern die Taranis wird sicherlich Chaos in anderen Systemen verursachen.

Ihnen wurde befohlen, die Taranis zu deaktivieren. Die Unfähigkeit einfache Befehle zu befolgen, macht deutlich, dass Sie nicht auf die Galatea gehören. Sie sind hiermit von allen Pflichten entbunden."

2241, "Die Zerstörung des Antriebsubsystems der Taranis ist deine erste und auch wichtigste Aufgabe.

Wenn dich die shivanischen Jäger aufhalten, verwende die Beta- und Gamma-Staffel, um dich zu decken, während du deine Angriffe auf die Taranis durchführst.

Wenn du es absolut nicht schaffen kannst, durchzukommen, sag deinen Staffelpiloten, dass sie die Taranis deaktivieren sollen. Ein paar gut platziere Stilettos sollten kurzen Prozess mit den Antrieben machen."

2242, "Sie sind abgeflogen, bevor Sie die Kaperung der Taranis sichergestellt haben. Die Omega-Transporter, die Sie schutzlos zurückgelassen haben, wurden von shivanischen Jägern zerstört.

Unsere Hoffnungen, die Taranis zu kapern, wurden durch Ihre Unachtsamkeit ruiniert.

Ihre Karriere ist vorbei, Pilot."

2243, "Die Entwaffnung der Taranis kann schwierig erscheinen, aber wenn du vorsichtig bist, sollte es nicht zu schwierig sein.

Einmal deaktiviert, kann sich die Taranis nicht mehr bewegen, was die Entwaffnung deutlich leichter macht.

Schalte zuerst die Raketenwerfer aus, dann das Waffensubsystem. Dies wird die Genauigkeit der verbliebenen Türme senken und genügend Zeit geben, sie auszuschalten."

2244, "Sie sind abgeflogen, bevor Sie die Kaperung der Taranis sichergestellt haben. Die Omega-Transporter, die Sie schutzlos zurückgelassen haben, wurden von shivanischen Jägern zerstört.

Unsere Hoffnungen, die Taranis zu kapern, wurden durch Ihre Unachtsamkeit ruiniert.

Ihre Karriere ist vorbei, Pilot."

2245, "Nachdem du die Taranis deaktiviert und entwaffnet hast, musst du warten, bis sie erfolgreich gekapert wurde.

Dies kann eine Weile dauern, aber es ist deine Pflicht diesen Prozess und alle betroffenen Schiffe zu überwachen und zu beschützen.

Wenn das zu schwer wird, kannst du die Delta-Staffel anfordern, um dich zu unterstützen."

2246, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Alpha 1. Sie waren maßgeblich bei der ersten Kaperung eines großen shivanischen Schiffes beteiligt!

Die Halkins bringt sie nach Tombaugh, wo Ingenieure ihre Technologie studieren werden und mehr über ihre Methoden und Motive in Erfahrung bringen können.

Wir haben gerade einige entmutigende Nachrichten vom terranischen Oberkommando erhalten, Piloten. Heute um 03:00 Uhr, nachdem die gekaperte Taranis zur Tombaugh-Installationsanlage im Ribos-System geschleppt wurde, haben die Shivaner einen großen Hinterhalt durchgeführt. Es gibt noch keine Bestätigung aus dem Filmmaterial, aber es ist klar, dass ein shivanischer Zerstörer gewaltiger Größe hereingesprungen ist und Tombaugh gemeinsam mit seiner gesamten Verteidigung zerstört hat. Wir haben diese neue Klasse von Zerstörer als $quoteLucifer$quote bezeichnet.

Trümmer der Station fallen noch immer aus der Umlaufbahn auf Ribos IV."

2270, "$b Die $b Lucifer

Terranische und vasudanische Jäger und Kreuzer haben die Lucifer angegriffen, wurden aber schnell ausgelöscht. Das Filmmaterial legt nahe, dass die Lucifer eine neue Art von Schild verwendete, welches für jeden unserer Angriffe unempfindlich ist. Es ist unnötig zu sagen, dass dies finstere Nachrichten sind. Wenn die Shivaner es tatsächlich geschafft haben, ein Schiff dieser Größenordnung mit einem Schild zu versehen, dann ist es nur noch eine Frage der Zeit, bevor sie alle Frontlinien-Installationsanlagen auslöschen und bis zu unseren Heimatsystemen durchfliegen."

2271, "$b Diplomatie

Da alle Versuche zur Kommunikation mit den Shivanern in Gewalt endeten, scheint es unwahrscheinlich, dass eine diplomatische Lösung funktionieren wird."

2272, "$b Status $b der $b Systeme

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt haben die Shivaner Kontrolle über Beta Cygni, Betelgeuse, Ross 128, Ikeya und Regulus. Der Großteil der vasudanischen Streitkräfte sammelt sich in Vega für einen Gegenschlag, während wir unsere Flotte in Antares für eine Anstrengung versammeln, um Ribos und Beta Cygni zurückzuerobern. Seltsamerweise scheinen die Shivaner nicht daran interessiert zu sein, die Kontrolle über irgendwelche Planeten in den Systemen zu übernehmen oder Rohstoffe zu sammeln. Stattdessen scheinen sie sich auf die Kontrolle einzelner Sprungknoten zu konzentrieren."

2273, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-32 $b Flail

Forschungs- und Entwicklungsmannschaften in Sol haben vor kurzem die Entwicklung an ein paar neuen Waffen abgeschlossen.

Eine Gruppe terranischer Wissenschaftler ist aus einem bisher unerforschten System, das als Laramis bekannt ist, zurückgekehrt und haben eine neue Waffe mit dem Namen Flail mitgebracht.

Die Flail ist ganz anders als unsere typischen Energiekanonen. Bitte sehen Sie für weitere Einzelheiten in der Waffendatenbank im Technikraum nach."

2274, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTM-9 $b Interceptor

Unsere Kommunikation mit vasudanischen Technikern hat die Interceptor-Rakete ergeben. Durch die Verbindung des vasudanisch entworfenen Antriebs mit einem terranischen Sprengkopf, konnten wir die bisher stärkste Anti-Jäger-Waffe produzieren. Sie ist eine aspektsuchende Rakete und benötigt ein paar Sekunden, um sich auf die gegnerische Antriebssignatur aufzuschalten, aber ihre Geschwindigkeit und Genauigkeit machen sie tödlich. Verwenden Sie sie gut."

2275, "Die Überlebenden des Tombaugh-Angriffes müssen sofort aus dem Ribos-System evakuiert werden. Wir haben zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht genug Feuerkraft, um Ribos zurückzuerobern. Das Ziel Ihrer Staffel ist es, die Iota-Transporter zu eskortieren."

2276, "Andere Staffeln begleiten ebenfalls diesen Konvoi. Die Alpha-Staffel ist für diese Operation verantwortlich und wird die Befehlsgewalt haben."

2277, "Der Konvoi muss den vorgesehenen Kontrollpunkt erreichen. Die Eskorte von diesem Punkt an wird von verbündeten vasudanischen Streitkräften, die von der PVD Pinnacle angeführt werden, durchgeführt."

2278, "Feindliche Streitkräfte wurden im gesamten System entdeckt und es gibt eine große Chance, dass unser Konvoi von shivanischen Jägern angegriffen wird."

2279, "Alle feindlichen Streitkräfte sollten eliminiert werden."

2280, "Die $f PVD $f Pinnacle wird beim vorgesehenen Kontrollpunkt ankommen. Dieser Zerstörer der Typhon-Klasse hat eine der erfahrensten Besatzungen der PVN. Sie wird die Flüchtlinge für den Rest ihrer Reise eskortieren."

2281, "Helfen Sie der Pinnacle, bis sie Sie abberufen hat, dann kehren Sie zur Basis zurück. Viele Leben hängen von dieser Operation ab. Viel Glück!"

2282, "Ihr primäres Ziel war es, die Transporter zum Treffen mit der Pinnacle zu eskortieren. Sie wurden zerstört und Hunderte an unschuldigen Leben gingen verloren. Ein solches Versagen kann in der GTA nicht toleriert werden."

2283, "Gehe immer sicher, dass die Iota-Staffel beschützt ist. Greife alle Schiffe an, die deine Transporter angreifen und versuche, nicht zu weit hinter sie zurückzufallen. Wenn du immer noch Schwierigkeiten hast, sie zu beschützen, versuche mal dein Schiff mit einer Flail zu bestücken. Wenn du lange genug Überlebst, wird die Pinnacle ankommen, um dich zu unterstützen."

2284, "Großartige Arbeit, Alpha 1! Sie haben es geschafft alle drei Iota-Transporter vor den shivanischen Angriffen zu retten. Uns wurde von der Besatzung der Pinnacle aufgetragen, Ihnen für eine gut gemachte Arbeit zu gratulieren. Die Zivilisten auf diesen Transportern schulden Ihnen ebenfalls ihr Leben."

2285, "Sie haben einige der Flüchtlinge auf Iota sicher eskortiert und dafür sind Sie zu loben. Es ist bedauerlich, dass so viele ihr Leben verlieren mussten. Um sie wird getrauert werden."

2286, "Alle drei Transporter zu beschützen ist äußerst schwierig. Möglicherweise musst du einzelne Schiffe zum Schutz einzelner Transporter zuweisen."

2314, "Die Vernichtung der GTSC Asimov hat unseren Versuchen, dieses System zu bewahren, einen großen Schlag versetzt. Aufgrund des Verlustes der Asimov-Daten, existiert Projekt $quoteTsunami$quote nicht mehr.

Die Aussicht, die shivanischen Kreuzer ohne die Tsunami-Bombe zerstören zu müssen ist, gelinde gesagt, entmutigend.

Ohne sie, haben wir keine Chance, genug große shivanische Schiffe zu zerstören, um diesen Krieg zu gewinnen."

2315, "Der Schutz der Asimov erfordert es, dass du keinen der shivanische Bomber in ihre Nähe lässt. Es gibt viele shivanische Jäger in dem Gebiet, aber du musst sie ignorieren und dir erst die Bomber vornehmen. Erfasse die Shaitans und zerstöre sie so schnell wie möglich mit deinen Interceptors."

$b Unsere $b Mission

Der Hammer des Lichts hat die vasudanische Flotte in Vega dezimiert. Die meisten der überlebenden vasudanischen Streitkräfte haben sich nach Deneb und Antares zurückgezogen und wurden dort ebenfalls angegriffen. Weil unsere Flotte ebenfalls Antares hält, sind die Beziehungen zwischen der PVN und der GTA angespannt.

Um die Lage zu entspannen, wurde uns befohlen, alle $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Außenposten in der Umgebung zu eliminieren. Glücklicherweise haben wir einige neue Werkzeuge, die uns dabei helfen."

Unsere erste neue Waffe ist der $quotePhoenix V$quote-Anti-Bomber-Sprengkopf. Diese Rakete kann sogar die dicksten Schilde durchstoßen und kann auch wirksam gegen größere Ziele, wie Frachter, eingesetzt werden. Weitere Einzelheiten finden Sie im Technikraum."

2332, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTB $b Medusa

Die neue Tsunami-Bombe ist die ultimative Anti-Kreuzer-Waffe und kann von den Medusas getragen werden. Nur wenige von ihnen können jeden Kreuzer ausschalten und da sind die Kreuzer der Aten-Klasse des Hammer des Lichts keine Ausnahme. Sie werden diese Bombe oft gegen größere $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Außenposten einsetzen."

2334, "Hier im Antares-System haben wir eine kleine HoL-Operationsbasis entdeckt. Ihr Geschwader wird geschickt, um sie zu eliminieren."

2335, "Sie werden alle $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Schiffe zerstören und dann zurück zur Galatea springen. Die Galatea wird Sie beobachten, falls die Situation außer Kontrolle gerät. Viel Glück!"

2336, "Wir freuen uns, dass Sie in der Lage waren, den shivanischen Einfluss in Antares zu unterdrücken. Deren Ankunft war unerwartet und das Bekämpfen der Shivaner fordert von unseren Streitkräften immer seinen Tribut. Glücklicherweise haben wir etwas bitteren Trost in der Tatsache, dass sie uns dabei $quotegeholfen$quote haben, die $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Anwesenheit in Antares zu eliminieren.

Angesichts Ihrer jüngsten Errungenschaften beim Schutze des GTA-Raumes gegen die shivanische Bedrohungen, verleihen wir Ihnen das Dekorierte Dienstkreuz. Sie sind wirklich ein hervorragender Pilot."

2337, "Bei der Bewertung dieser Mission haben wir festgestellt, dass sich der Hammer des Lichts im Antares-System nur gesammelt hat, um die Shivaner in das Gebiet zu locken. Da jetzt eine shivanische Anwesenheit in Antares aufgebaut wurde, möge Gott der Allianz beistehen."

2338, "Du solltest ohne große Schwierigkeiten in der Lage sein, durchzuhalten, bis die Galatea eintrifft. Versuche in diesen ersten paar Schlachten die Stärke zu bewahren um, sobald die Kreuzer reinspringen, alles gegen sie einzusetzen, was du hast. Die Galatea kann alle Jäger und selbst einen Kreuzer handhaben, aber du musst ihr helfen, sie zu beschädigen. Je mehr Türme du auf einem Kreuzer zerstörst, desto weniger Schaden wird die Galatea erhalten."

Der terranische Geheimdienst hat die letzten zwei Wochen damit zugebracht, die Flugdaten vom Tombaugh-Angriff zu untersuchen.

Der Geheimdienst weiß nicht, wie die Shivaner die Taranis verfolgt haben, aber sie haben ein Team von Ingenieuren, die versuchen, es herauszufinden.

Mit dem Verlust von Tombaugh, haben die Shivaner die Kontrolle über den Ribos-Subraumknoten erhalten. Damit stehen zwischen der Lucifer-Flotte und der vasudanischen Heimatwelt nur noch zwei Sprünge.

Das vasudanisch-terranische Ulysses-Projekt wurde abgeschlossen und die Galatea hat einen vollständigen Satz dieser Jäger erhalten. Er ist das manövrierfähigste Schiff, das je von der PVN oder der GTA entwickelt wurde und sollte in den nächsten Einsätzen sehr nützlich sein. Er kann auch mit der Prometheus bestückt werden, der stärksten Kanone, die wir je entwickelt haben. Verwenden Sie beides gut."

2463, "$b Einen $b shivanischen $b Jäger $b kapern

Der Geheimdienst hat einen gewagten Plan zusammengestellt, welcher es uns ermöglicht, mehr über die Shivaner zu erfahren. Wir werden versuchen, einen shivanischen Jäger zu kapern. Machen Sie sich bereit und melden Sie sich sofort bei Ihren Staffeln für die Einsatzbesprechungen."

2464, "Die Shivaner haben eine Reihe an Operationsbasen im Deneb-System eingerichtet. Sie haben mehrere Versorgungsdepots, die über das System verstreut sind, sowie mehrere Reparaturzentren für ihre beschädigten Jäger."

2465, "Jede ihrer Reparaturzentren besteht aus einem Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse und zusätzlichen Vorräten. Die Shakti ist einer dieser Kreuzer in dem Gebiet."

2466, "Alle Jäger in dem Gebiet rund um die Shakti sind beschädigt und müssen repariert werden. Dies macht sie zu einfachen Zielen. Einer unsere Ziele in dieser Mission ist es, dieses Reparaturzentrum außer Betrieb zu nehmen. Dies wird die shivanischen Fähigkeiten im Deneb-System erheblich einschränken."

2467, "Alle Jäger in dem Gebiet rund um die Shakti sind beschädigt und müssen repariert werden. Dies macht sie zu einfachen Zielen."

2468, "Einer der Jäger, die von der Shakti repariert wird, ist ein Jäger der Dragon-Klasse, der als $quote$h Arjuna $h 1$| $quote bezeichnet wird. Der Dragon ist das manövrierfähigste und auch gefährlichste Schiff der Shivaner."

2469, "Der Geheimdienst hat verlangt, dass wir den Dragon für Forschungszwecke kapern. Da der $quoteArjuna 1$quote-Dragon nur wenig Energie hat, ist er in einem geschwächten Zustand und ist damit der beste Kandidat für diese Operation. Sie müssen Arjuna 1 deaktivieren, indem Sie sein Antriebsubsystem zerstören."

2470, "Sobald Arjuna 1 deaktiviert ist, wird die $f Charon mit ihm andocken und zurück zur Galatea springen. Wir müssen Arjuna 1 kapern! Wir können nicht zulassen, dass er zerstört wird. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir Ihr Schiff mit einer Advanced Disruptor bestückt. Verwenden Sie sie, um seine Antriebe auszuschalten."

2471, "Da dieses Zentrum so schlecht verteidigt ist, senden wir für den Angriff nur Alpha und Beta. Alpha wird Beta Deckung geben, bis die Shakti zerstört wurde. Dann wird Alpha versuchen, Arjuna 1 zu deaktivieren."

2472, "Wenn Alpha Arjuna 1 nicht deaktivieren kann, steht die Delta-Staffel zur Verfügung. Da Delta gegenwärtig die $f Bastion bewacht, werden wir sie nur dann schicken, wenn es unbedingt erforderlich ist. Wir glauben allerdings, dass Sie es ohne ihre Hilfe schaffen können."

2473, "Weil wir Ihr Schiff bereits individuell angepasst haben, werden Sie nicht in der Lage sein, Ihre Bestückung anzupassen. Sie haben Ihre Befehle. Wegtreten!"

2474, "Großartige Arbeit, Alpha 1! Wir haben ein shivanisches Reparaturdepot zerstört und es geschafft einen einsatzfähigen shivanischen Jäger zu erhalten. Unsere Techniker arbeiten gegenwärtig an seiner Nachkonstruktion."

2475, "Für Ihre ausgezeichneten Pilotfähigkeiten, hat sich die GTA entschieden, Ihnen das Dekorierte Fliegerkreuz zu verleihen. Herzlichen Glückwunsch!"

2476, "Ihr Versäumnis, die Shakti zu zerstören, hat unsere Chancen, das Deneb-System zu halten stark eingeschränkt. Solche kritischen Fehlschläge können nicht toleriert werden!"

2477, "Deine beste Chance bei der Zerstörung der Shakti sind die Bomber der Beta-Staffel. Wenn du die Jäger lange genug von ihren Hecks halten kannst, bis sie ihre Tsunamis abfeuern, ist die Shakti dem Untergang geweiht. Aber selbst wenn du die Bomber verlierst, kannst du die Shakti immer noch selbst zerstören. Versuche zuerst ihr Waffensystem auszuschalten und dann ihre Türme. Im schlimmsten Fall kannst du Delta anfordern, um dich zu unterstützen."

2478, "Gute Arbeit bei der Zerstörung der Shakti. Die Delta-Staffel war dabei erfolgreich den Jäger der Dragon-Klasse zu kapern. Doch aufgrund der Abwesenheit von Delta kassierte die Bastion in der Nähe von Deneb III schwere Treffer. Sie hat es überstanden, aber es bedarf Reparaturen. Es ist bedauerlich, dass Sie Ihre Hilfe gebraucht haben, um einen einzigen shivanischen Jäger zu deaktivieren."

2479, "Einen Dragon zu deaktivieren ist keine einfache Aufgabe, aber du wurdest mit den richtigen Werkzeugen ausgestattet, um es zu schaffen. Arjuna 1s Energieversorgung ist niedrig und kann seine Schilde nicht regenerieren. Konzentriere dich zuerst auf die Beseitigung seines Schildes und dann konzentriere dich darauf, irgendwelche Treffer mit der Advanced Disruptor zu landen. Geduld ist der Schlüssel."

$b Unsere $b Befehle

Wir sind mittlerweile in das Deneb-System eingeflogen. Nach Ihrer Begegnung mit der abfliegenden Eva in Antares, hat das terranische Oberkommando daraus abgeleitet, dass die Shivaner einen Mehrgleisigen Angriff auf Vasuda von Deneb und Antares aus versuchen werden.

Die Intrepid und die Minnow sind für den Schutz des Antares-Vasuda-Knotens verantwortlich, während die Galatea und die Bastion Deneb bewachen."

2504, "$b Der $b shivanische $b Angriff

Wir erwarten, dass die Hauptstreitmacht des shivanischen Angriffes durch Antares kommt, angeführt von der Lucifer. Eine kleinere sekundäre Streitmacht, angeführt vom Demon-Zerstörer Eva, wird durch Deneb kommen. Die Shivaner kontrollieren bereits den Vega-Deneb-Sprungknoten, also muss unsere Verteidigung am Deneb-Vasuda-Sprungknoten sein.

Das Finden und Zerstören der Eva ist unsere oberste Priorität."

2505, "$b Der $b gekaperte $b shivanische $b Dragon

Wie Sie wissen, haben wir hier in Deneb einen shivanischen Jäger der Dragon-Klasse gekapert. Unsere Techniker haben diesen außerirdischen Jäger mit terranischen Instrumenten neu ausgestattet und in einen flugfähigen Zustand gebracht.

Allerdings gibt es in unserem Neuentwurf ein paar Fehler. Wir konnten die shivanische Bewaffnung nicht zum Laufen bringen, weshalb dieser Jäger mit terranischer Bewaffnung bestückt wurde. Ebenso konnten wir die seitlichen Manövriertriebwerke oder Nachbrenner nicht vernünftig zum Laufen bringen, weshalb die Manövrierfähigkeit des Schiffes beschränkt ist.

Auch hatten wir Schwierigkeiten mit den shivanischen Antriebssystemen. In Testläufen brach der Antrieb des Dragons für kurze Zeit zusammen. Während wir sprechen, suchen wir nach einer Lösung dieses Problems.

Die Kaperung dieses shivanischen Jägers wird uns große Fortschritte in der Jägertechnologie der Allianz bringen."

2506, "In dieser Mission werden wir den gekaperten shivanischen Jäger der Dragon-Klasse auf einer Aufklärungsmission im Deneb-System verwenden."

2507, "Die Shivaner scheinen eine große Anzahl an Schiffen in das Deneb-System durch den Vega-Sprungknoten zu bringen. Wir glauben, dass dies die Vorbereitung auf einen vorläufigen Angriff auf Vasuda ist."

2508, "Weil die Shivaner eine dichte Kontrolle über den Vega-Deneb-Sprungknoten ausüben, können wir keinen terranischen Aufklärer schicken. Wenn wir allerdings den shivanischen Dragon fliegen, glauben wir, dass Sie unentdeckt reinschlüpfen können."

2509, "Es gibt vier shivanische Jäger in dem Gebiet, die eine enge Patrouille aufrechterhalten. Wenn Sie diesen Jägern zu nah kommen, werden sie sicherlich Ihr Schiff scannen, Ihre Anwesenheit entdecken und das Feuer eröffnen. Vermeiden Sie Kontakt mit einem der Arjuna-Jäger."

2510, "Arjuna scheint in ihrer Patroullie feste Muster einzuhalten."

2511, "Beobachten Sie bei Ihrer Ankunft ihre Flugmuster und planen Sie einen Kurs, um Kontakt zu vermeiden."

2512, "In dem Fall, dass Sie von der Arjuna-Staffel angegriffen werden, kehren Sie sofort zur Galatea zurück."

2513, "Ihr primäres Ziel ist es, einen Scan aller Schiffe durchzuführen, die durch den Vega-Deneb-Sprungknoten fliegen. Dazu gehören Kriegsschiffe, Frachter und Transporter. Versuchen Sie auch, den Inhalt von Frachtbehältern in dem Gebiet zu bestimmen."

2514, "Wir haben Grund zu der Annahme, dass ein shivanischer Zerstörer der Demon-Klasse, die $h Eva$| , durch dieses Gebiet fliegen wird. Wenn sie es tut, ist es zwingend erforderlich, dass Sie sie scannen. Denken Sie daran, dass Ihr Jäger nur teilweise funktionsfähig ist und sich seine Flugsysteme unvorhersehbar verhalten werden. Seien Sie vorsichtig. Command Ende."

2515, "Sie haben es nicht geschafft genügend Schiffe zur Aufklärung zu scannen, um die shivanischen Streitkräfte wirksam zu untersuchen. Mit dem Zerstörer der Lucifer-Klasse in dem Gebiet, sind wir in ernster Gefahr. Ihr Versäumnis, die benötigten Daten zu sammeln, wird schlimme Folgen haben."

2516, "Das Scannen der Kriegsschiffe bedeutet, dass man nah genug an alle Kreuzer und Großkampfschiffe kommen muss, um sie vollständig zu scannen. Die Kreuzer sollten einfach sein, du kannst einfach auf sie warten, wie sie zu dir kommen, während du Arjuna umgehst. Die Eva verlässt das Gebiet hingegen recht schnell, weshalb du sichergehen musst, sie so schnell wie möglich zu scannen."

2517, "Sie waren nicht in der Lage, lange genug im Gebiet zu bleiben, um eine klare Messung über die shivanische Angriffsstreitmacht zu erhalten. Dieser Fehlschlag wird uns teuer zu stehen kommen."

2518, "Stelle sicher, dass du auf Befehle wartest, bevor du zur Basis zurückkehrst. Erst wenn sich Command sicher ist, dass alle Schiffe berücksichtigt wurden, darfst du abfliegen. Wenn du von der Arjuna-Staffel entdeckt wirst, versuche dein Bestes, um sie zu umgehen. Sobald die Kriegsschiffe hereinkommen, mache schnelle Flüge, um sie zu scannen, um dann wieder aus Arjunas Reichweite zu kommen."

2519, "Pilot, Sie bringen uns schreckliche Nachrichten. Wenn sowohl die Eva als auch die Lucifer hier in Deneb sind, wird es äußerst schwierig sein, den shivanischen Angriff aufzuhalten. Dennoch haben Sie mit dem Scannen der shivanischen Kriegsschiffe eine ausgezeichnete Arbeit abgeliefert. Gut gemacht!"

2520, "Es ist bedauerlich, dass Sie keine Informationen über die shivanischen Frachter und Transporter erhalten konnten. Es wäre nützlich gewesen zu wissen, was die Shivaner in das Gebiet brachten."

2521, "Die Frachter und Transporter zu untersuchen, benötigt eine kleine Gerissenheit. Du musst sehr vorsichtig sein, um die Arjuna-Schiffe zu umgehen, während du die Schiffe so schnell wie möglich scannst. Die beste Gelegenheit für einen Scan der Frachter ist während ihres Andockmanövers. Bei den Transportern solltest du dich hinter sie hängen und die Geschwindigkeit anpassen. Und verwende immer deine Kurztasten, um Arjunas Positionen zu überwachen."

2522, "Die Tatsache, dass Sie auch die shivanischen Versorgungsschiffe scannen konnten ist wirklich herausragend. Ihr Mut und Ihre Pilotfähigkeiten sind zu loben.

Allerdings sind die Nachrichten schlecht. Die Shivaner haben genug Vorräte auf diesen Schiffen, um einen längeren Angriff auf Vasuda aufrecht zu erhalten. Wir glauben, dass ihre Angriffsstreitmacht aus mindestens acht vollständigen Jägergeschwadern, beiden Kreuzern, der Eva und der Lucifer besteht. Die Dinge sehen nicht gut aus."

2523, "Die Fracht, die Sie identifiziert haben, beinhalten Teile für shivanische Jäger. Dies führt uns zu der Vermutung, dass die Shivaner eine Basis in Deneb errichten werden, in der Nähe von Vasuda. Diese Information wird bei der Planung unseres Gegenschlags von unschätzbarem Wert sein.

Für Ihre Sorgfalt bei Aufklärungsmissionen, verleihen wir Ihnen die Verdienstvolle Einheit."

2578, "Gute Arbeit bei der Zerstörung der Eva."

2579, "Die Galatea wurde zerstört! Viele Leben, viele Freunde sind fort. Jeder in der Galaktisch Terranischen Allianz fühlt diesen schweren Verlust. 

Dennoch ist die Tragödie der Vasudaner größer. Es gibt nichts mehr zwischen der shivanischen Flotte und Vasuda. Bald wird auch ihre Heimatwelt fort sein.

Unsere Jäger kämpften tapfer, um die Galatea zu bewahren, aber es gab nichts, was hätte getan werden können. Die Lucifer war einfach zu mächtig."

2580, "Die Galatea wurde zerstört! Aber nicht durch die Feuerkraft eines Kreuzers oder eines Zerstörers, sondern nur eines Bombers. Das ist in der Tat ein trauriger Tag für die Allianz. Wenn ein Bomber-Geschwader eins unserer Flaggschiffe zerstören kann, wie können wir dann die Lucifer besiegen?"

2581, "Beschütze die Galatea vor den Bombern unter allen Umständen! Greife die Nephilims an, bevor du dir Sorgen um die Manticores machst. Die Bomben der Nephilims abzuschießen, bewahrt die Galatea sogar noch länger. Wenn du einige Synaptics vom Eva-Angriff übrig hast, verwende sie jetzt."

2582, "Sie sind von der wichtigsten Schlacht ihrer Karriere geflüchtet. Die Galatea ging verloren und die Personen von Vasuda Prime sind dem Untergang geweiht.

So eine Feigheit ist gewissenslos. Sie haben somit permanentes Flugverbot."

2584, "Viele Leben wurden durch die Hermes-Fluchtkapseln gerettet. Dafür sind wir dankbar. Aber wir trauen um den Verlust von General Wolf. Er war ein großer Kommandant und er starb mit dem Schiff, das er liebte.

Alle überlebenden Piloten werden der GTD Bastion zugewiesen. Obwohl wir alle Freunde auf der Galatea verloren haben, haben wir keine Zeit die Toten zu betrauern. Das Schicksal der Allianz ist düster."

Hier spricht General Shima. Während Sie an Bord der GTD Bastion sind, werde ich Sie über Informationen vom Oberkommando unterrichten. Ich drücke hiermit mein Willkommen an alle Piloten aus, die bisher auf der Galatea stationiert waren. Ich wünschte Ihre Neuzuweisungen hätten unter besseren Umständen stattgefunden.

Der Verlust der Galatea ist ein großer Schlag für uns alle. Wir haben viele Freunde und nahestehende Personen verloren. Wir haben auch viele großartige Piloten verloren. Wir müssen unsere Bemühungen verdoppeln, wenn wir vorhaben, die shivanische Flotte aufzuhalten."

Das bringt mich zu dem Grund für diese Besprechung. Wie einige von Ihnen sicherlich bereits gehört haben, erhielten wir kurz nach der Zerstörung der Galatea, um 19:00 Uhr gestern Abend, die Information, dass die shivanische Lucifer den Sprung nach Vasuda gemacht hat. Die Lucifer-Flotte bombardierte im Anschluss Vasuda Prime für dreizehn Stunden aus dem Orbit."

Die meisten flüchtenden Transportschiffe wurden zerstört. Alle großen vasudanischen Städte wurden dem Erdboden gleichgemacht und der Großteil der Landmasse ist ab sofort unbewohnbar. Alle unsere Angriffe, die von nahegelegenen Installationsanlagen durchgeführt wurden, wurden abgewehrt.

Wir haben den Kontakt zu allen terranischen Schiffen in dem Gebiet verloren, aber es macht den Eindruck, als würde die shivanische Flotte jetzt weiterziehen. Es wird geschätzt, dass vier Milliarden unschuldiger Vasudaner ihr Leben bei diesem Angriff verloren haben.

Das terranische Oberkommando bereitet sich vor, dabei zu helfen, alle Überlebenden zu anderen bewohnbaren Planeten in dem Gebiet zu evakuieren."

2603, "$b Unsere $b Befehle

Worauf wir uns jetzt konzentrieren müssen ist, die Lucifer-Flotte davon abzuhalten weitere Bewegungen in Richtung Erde zu unternehmen. Wir wurden in den Bereitschaftsstatus gebracht und uns wurde befohlen alle Evakuierungsoperationen in Vasuda und den umliegenden Systemen zu unterstützen.

Wir haben Deneb verloren. Antares ist praktisch ohne Verteidigung. Vasuda ist ein umkämpftes System."

2668, "Wir haben die Aufzeichnungen von Altair IV erfolgreich extrahiert. Sie wurden teilweise entschlüsselt und werden in den terranischen Raum zurückgebracht. Der Omega-Transporter wird erneut den Transport der Wissenschaftler und der Aufzeichnungen übernehmen."

2669, "Lasse im schlimmsten Fall zu, dass Omega 2 abgeschossen wird und kümmere dich direkt um die Leo-Bomber. Sobald du die erste Welle von Leo zerstört hast, kannst du einfach jedem Befehlen Jäger anzugreifen und du solltest wenige Probleme haben, Omega 1 zum Sprungknoten zu eskortieren."

2670, "Wenn du Probleme dabei hast, beide Transporter funktionsfähig zu halten, behalte dies im Hinterkopf: Das Leo-Geschwader besteht nur aus 4 Bombern und hat keine Verstärkungen. Zerstöre sie so schnell wie möglich und musst dir um Omega 1 keine Sorgen mehr machen. Wenn du den Typhon nicht zerstören kannst, versuche zumindest ihn mit Disruptor-Raketen auszuschalten, während Omega 2 vorbeifliegt."

$b Die $b Lucifer

Die Shivaner haben endgültig den Standort des Sol-Systems bestimmt. Die Lucifer hat sich hier in Sirius für den Subraumsprung nach Delta Serpentis in Position gebracht.

Von Delta Serpentis aus wird sie sicherlich den Sprung nach Sol machen, um unsere Heimatwelt zu zerstören."

2674, "$b Neue $b Informationen

Von den Aufzeichnungen, die Sie aus Altair rausgeholt haben, haben wir die Mittel entdeckt, um die Lucifer zu zerstören. Wie Sie wissen, funktionieren unsere Schildsysteme im Subraum nicht. Das gleiche gilt auch für die Lucifer. Noch wichtiger ist, dass die Aufzeichnungen die Informationen enthalten, wie wir ein Großkampfschiff in den und innerhalb des Subraums verfolgen können.

Wenn wir die Lucifer in den Subraum verfolgen können, so glauben wir, dass eine kleine Angriffsstreitmacht ausreichen kann, um sie zu zerstören."

2675, "$b Unsere $b Befehle

Uns wurde die Aufgabe zugewiesen, die Lucifer zu zerstören, bevor sie Sol erreicht. Die Bastion ist derzeit auf dem Weg, um die Lucifer am $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-Subraumknoten abzufangen.

Die Bastion wird versuchen, eine enge Deckung zu bieten, während Ursas eine Bombenlast an Harbingern abliefern. Wir glauben, dass ohne das Schildsystem, auf das sie sich so stark verlässt, die Lucifer angreifbar ist.

Denken Sie daran, dass dies eine zeitkritische Operation ist. Wenn wir nicht bald nach der Lucifer in den Subraum einfliegen, können wir unseren Angriff nicht starten."

2676, "$b Zerstörung $b der $b Lucifer

Durch Ihre früheren Scans der Lucifer im Deneb-System haben wir festgestellt, dass sie von fünf primären Reaktoren angetrieben wird. Diese Reaktoren verteilen sich über die Lucifer.

Wenn alle fünf Reaktoren in kürzester Zeit zerstört werden, wird die Lucifer keine Chance haben, ihrer Zerstörung zu entgehen."

2677, "$b Missionsvorbereitung

Wir haben nicht viel Zeit. Melden Sie sich sofort bei den Missionseinsatzbesprechungen."

2678, "Wir haben nur wenige Gelegenheiten die $h Lucifer aufzuhalten. Sie hält auf das Sol-System zu, aber wir haben noch die Gelegenheit, sie in Sirius abzufangen."

2679, "Wenn Sie der Lucifer in Sirius begegnen, halten Sie sie auf, bis der Rest der Flotte mit Ihnen aufgeholt hat."

2680, "Die Bastion wurde in dieser Schlacht schwer beschädigt. Die Last der Zerstörung der Lucifer wird sich damit noch mehr auf die Bomber verschieben. Die Bastion wird nur noch von begrenzter Hilfe sein.

Wir fliegen jetzt in das $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-System."

2681, "Versuche alle Bomber zu zerstören, bevor sie die Bastion erreichen."

2682, "Die GTD Bastion ist in erstklassigem Zustand, um die Lucifer anzugreifen. Wir fliegen jetzt gerade nach Delta Serpentis."

2683, "Für Ihre hervorragende Verteidigung der GTD Bastion wurde Ihnen die Militärische Verteidigungsmedaille verliehen!"

2684, "Die Bastion wurde zerstört! Es gibt wenig Hoffnung, die Lucifer an diesem Punkt noch aufzuhalten. Das ist der traurigste Tag für die Allianz. Die Lucifer wird voraussichtlich in 40 Stunden die Erde erreichen."

2685, "Schieße die Bomber immer zuerst ab! Versuche ihre Bomben abzuschießen. Du darfst die Zerstörung der Bastion in diesem Stadium des Krieges nicht zulassen!"

2686, "Die Bastion machte den Sprung nach Delta Serpentis und Sie sind ihr nicht gefolgt? Sie wurde kurz nach ihrer Ankunft zerstört! Wir haben keine Möglichkeit, die Lucifer aufzuhalten. Das ist sicher das Ende der Allianz. Die Lucifer wird voraussichtlich in 40 Stunden die Erde erreichen."

2687, "Nachdem die Bastion abgeflogen ist, vergewissere dich, dass du innerhalb des Sprungknoten rausspringst."

2701, "In wenigen Minuten werden wir in das $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-System einfliegen. Wir werden dann den wichtigsten Einsatz unserer Geschichte beginnen. Wir werden für das Überleben der Erde kämpfen."

2702, "Unser Plan ist es, die Entfernung mit der Lucifer schnell zu verringern, damit die Bastion direkt hinter ihr in den Subraum einfliegen kann. Einmal im Subraum, werden wir die Lucifer angreifen und vernichten!"

2703, "Ihre Aufgabe wird es sein, die Bastion zu decken, damit sie der Lucifer schnell näherkommen kann.

Dieser Zerstörer muss unter allen Umständen aufgehalten werden! Versagen ist hier absolut keine Option, Piloten! Viel Glück!"

2704, "Warum Sie sich entschlossen haben, das Schlachtgebiet zu verlassen ist ein absolutes Mysterium. Wenn irgendwelche Historiker die Zerstörung der Erde überleben, werden sie sich sicherlich fragen, was Ihnen durch den Kopf ging.

In einer Schlacht um das Schicksal der Erde sind Sie geflohen wie ein Feigling."

2710, "Alpha 1! Sie müssen diese gegnerischen Jäger so schnell wie möglich wegräumen! Wir müssen die Lucifer einholen!"

2711, "Es hat keinen Zweck! Die Bastion wird die Lucifer niemals einholen. Sie müssen sie selbst verfolgen, Alpha 1!"

2712, "Wir starten vier Ursas, die mit Harbinger bewaffnet sind. Wir können nur beten, dass es genug sein werden."

2713, "Wir bereiten vier Thoths vor, um dabei zu helfen, Deckung zu geben. Sobald sie bereit sind, werden wir sie einsetzen."

2714, "Alpha 1. Die Thoths sind bereit und auf dem Weg."

2715, "Sie haben ungefähr 10 Minuten, um den Sprungpunkt zu erreichen. Länger und Sie werden nicht genug Zeit haben, die Lucifer zu besiegen."

2717, "Alpha 1! Sie haben noch sieben Minuten! Beeilung!"

2718, "Sie haben nur noch etwa vier Minuten Zeit! Bewegung, Piloten!"

2719, "Alpha 1, wenn Sie nicht in der nächsten Minute springen, ist alles verloren! Bitte, machen Sie den Sprung!"

2722, "Wir werden das niemals rechtzeitig schaffen!"

2723, "Seien Sie ruhig! Wir haben keine andere Option, Pilot!"

2724, "Weiterfliegen! Los! Los!"

2725, "Sie sind fast da, Alpha!"

2726, "Das war es, Alpha 1! Wir haben jetzt keine Chance mehr, die Lucifer zu kriegen. Die Erde ist dem Untergang geweiht!"

2727, "In Ordnung, Kumpels. Lasst uns das Feld pflügen!"

$b * $b Vega-System
$b * $b 15. $b April $b 2335

$b Willkommen $b beim $b GTI

Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Pilot! Sie wurden für den Spezialoperationszweig des Galaktisch Terranischen Geheimdienst ausgewählt. Sie haben die strengen medizinischen und psychologischen Untersuchungen des GTI bestanden und ihre Dienstakte unter General Po auf der GTD Intrepid war vorbildlich.

Sie werden die Alpha-Staffel der 91. Phantoms anführen. Als ein Pilot des GTI werden Ihre Missionen hochsensible Kampf- und Eindämmungsoperationen beinhalten. Diese Einsätze sind verdeckt und geheim. Eine Verletzung des Geheimhaltungsprotokolls führt zu einem Militärgericht und einer möglichen Hinrichtung im Rahmen des Spionagen- und Gegenspionagengesetzes!"

2787, "$b Die $b Kommandostruktur $b des $b GTI

Die Primäraufgabe des GTI ist es, das terranische Oberkommando mit genauen und umfassenden Informationen über die Taktik, den Technologien, Aktivitäten und den strategischen Zielen von Streitkräften zu versorgen, die der GTA feindlich gesonnen sind. Der GTI ist in drei Zweige unterteilt, jeder mit einer eigenen Flotte und jeder konzentriert sich auf bestimmte Bereiche von Geheimoperationen.

Die Spezialoperationen, geleitet von der GTD Krios, sind auf strategische Angriffe und Eindämmung spezialisiert. Unsere Missionen beinhalten Ziele hoher Priorität, die zu empfindlich, gefährlich oder brisant für standardmäßige GTA-Streitkräfte sind.

Der Nachrichtendienst, angeführt durch die GTD Soyakaze, spezialisiert sich auf Infiltration und Spionage. Der Nachrichtendienst führt in erster Linie Aufklärungsflüge und gezielte Schläge durch und ihre Missionen sind so geplant, dass Sie so wenig wie möglich dem Kampf ausgesetzt sind."

2788, "$b Fortsetzung $b der $b Erklärung $b über $b die $b Kommandostruktur $b des $b GTI

Forschung und Entwicklung, befehligt von der GTD Repulse, ist auf die Entwicklung von den neusten Technologien spezialisiert. Die Missionen von F&E beinhalten den Einsatz und die Feldtests von fortgeschrittenen Waffen- und Kriegsschiffprototypen. Als ein Offizier des GTI werden Sie Zugang zu diesen Technologien erhalten, bevor Sie den GTA-Piloten zur Verfügung stehen.

Normalerweise führen die drei Zweige gemeinsame Operationen miteinander durch, die von einer einzigen Kommandoflotte geleitet werden. Leider hat uns der Verlust der GTD Legion in der Schlacht um Deneb am Anfang dieses Jahres dazu gezwungen, unsere Operationen etwas zu dezentralisieren. Wir werden unsere Befehle direkt vom Oberkommando der GTA erhalten."

2789, "$b Sol

Alle Bemühungen, den Kontakt mit der Erde wiederherzustellen, sind gescheitert. Wie Sie wissen, brach der Sol-Sprungknoten in Delta Serpentis, kurz nachdem verbündete Streitkräfte die Lucifer während Ihres Subraumsprungs verfolgten und zerstörten, zusammen. Wir glauben, dass die Explosion der fünf Reaktoren der Lucifer eine Subraumkatastrophe erzeugte, die den Knoten, vielleicht dauerhaft, geschlossen hat. Diese Katastrophe scheint durch eine Art von Kettenreaktion auch die wechselhaften Knoten nach Deneb und Beta Aquilae geschlossen zu haben. Wir haben derzeit keine Möglichkeit, über den Subraum ins Sol-System zu fliegen.

Während alle terranischen Wissenschaftler daran arbeiten, den Kontakt mit der Erde und dem GTA-Hauptquartier wiederherzustellen, wurde im $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-System eine vorläufige GTA-Kommandozentrale eingerichtet."

2790, "$b Zustand $b des $b Vertrages

Kulturelle und politische Unterschiede bedrohen den terranisch-vasudanischen Vertrag seit Anfang an. Nach vierzehn Jahren Krieg ist das Verhältnis zwischen der GTA und der PVN von gegenseitigem Misstrauen, Missverständnissen und der fehlenden vollständigen Kooperation zur Erfüllung des Vertrags geplagt.

Die Erhaltung dieses zerbrechlichen Friedensvertrages ist von größter Bedeutung. Sowohl der terranisch-vasudanische wie auch der shivanische Krieg hat einen hohen Tribut von unseren Flotten gefordert, weshalb unsere Spezies zusammenarbeiten müssen, wenn wir irgendeine Hoffnung haben wollen, die shivanische Bedrohung zu besiegen. Als Offizier des GTI ist es Ihre Verantwortung, sich sowohl im Kampf, wie auch bei der persönlichen Interaktion mit vasudanischen Kollegen gemäß Ihrer Stellung und Ranges würdig zu verhalten. Sollten Spannungen außer Kontrolle geraten, werden die Spezialoperationen Sie entsprechend über die passende Methode zur Eindämmung der Situation instruieren."

2791, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-43 $b Leech

Ihnen ist der neue Leech-Prototyp ausgegeben worden. Die Leech entleert die Energieversorgung von gegnerischen Jägern. Verwenden Sie die Kanone, um Nachbrenner, Energiewaffen und Schilde zu deaktivieren. Es ist keine Erfassung von Subsystemen notwendig, einfach zielen und schießen. Die Leech ist eine Anti-Jäger-Waffe mit minimaler Wirkung gegen größere Schiffe."

2792, "Um etwa 15:30 Uhr haben $f terranische und $f vasudanische Jäger einen shivanischen Angriff auf das Forschungsschiff Fermi abgewehrt, einer unserer Hauptkommunikationsterminals in $b Vega$| . Während des Gefechtes feuerten terranische Piloten auf unsere vasudanischen Verbündeten mit der Absicht zu töten. Das terranische Oberkommando befürchtet, dass, wenn die $f PVN von diesem Vorfall erfährt, der Vertrag und unsere Hoffnung, die $h Shivaner zu besiegen, bald zusammenbrechen werden."

2793, "Ihr Ziel ist es, das Gebiet zu säubern, um zu verhindern, dass sich die Nachrichten über diesen Vorfall über unsere Sicherheitszone verbreiten. Zerstören Sie alles, bis auf das $f GTI$| -Kommunikationsterminal. Der Verlust unschuldigen Lebens ist bedauerlich, aber notwendig, um die $f terranisch-vasudanische $f Allianz zu bewahren und die $h Shivaner zu besiegen. Sie dürfen nicht versagen!"

2794, "Wir haben ein Zeitfenster von fünf Minuten in dem wir diese Operation abschließen müssen. Länger zu bleiben riskiert eine Entdeckung durch $f GTA$| - oder $f PVN$| -Streitkräften. Fliegen Sie rein, machen Sie Ihre Arbeit und fliegen Sie wieder raus. Viel Glück!"

2795, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Sie haben eine totale Säuberung des Gebietes durchgeführt und einen brisanten Vorfall eingedämmt. Das vasudanische Oberkommando ist sich dieser Ereignisse nicht bewusst und der Friedensvertrag bleibt in Kraft."

2796, "Für das Zeigen eines starken Pflichtgefühls und der Verpflichtung, die terranisch-vasudanische Allianz um jeden Preis zu erhalten, erhalten Sie die Belobigungsmedaille."

2797, "Leider hat Ihr Geschwader das GTI-Kommunikationsterminal in Ihrer Eile, die PVT Aries daran zu hindern, es zu nutzen, zerstört. Während das Terminal nicht so wichtig war, wie der Erfolg der heutigen Mission, stellte es dennoch ein bedeutendes Mittel für die GTI dar, welches jetzt ersetzt werden muss.

Dieser Vorfall wird in Ihrer Akte vermerkt. Ich schlage vor, dass Sie in Zukunft solche Verluste vermeiden."

2798, "Zerstöre nicht das Terminal."

2799, "Sie haben die PVT Aries nicht eliminieren können, bevor sie unsere Ziele an vasudanische Streitkräfte mitgeteilt hat. Die Vasudaner betrachten diesen Vorfall als glatten Verrat der terranisch-vasudanischen Allianz und haben angedroht, sich aus dem Friedensvertrag zurückzuziehen. Das terranische Oberkommando hat den kompletten Spezialoperationszweig der GTI verleugnet und kämpft darum, einen Krieg abzuwenden. Sie und Ihr Geschwader werden für Ihre Unfähigkeit bezahlen!"

2800, "Zerstöre den Transporter Aries, bevor es das Kommunikationsterminal verwenden kann, um eine Nachricht zu schicken, vorzugsweise bevor dieser überhaupt mit dem Terminal andocken kann. Vergesse nicht deine Staffelpiloten zu verwenden."

2801, "Sie erlaubten es der PVT Pisces zu entkommen und die vasudanischen Streitkräfte über die heutigen Ereignisse zu informieren. Dieser Vorfall hat unseren Vertrag mit den Vasudanern aufs Spiel gesetzt und droht die Allianz in einen glatten Krieg zu stürzen. Das terranische Oberkommando hat jegliche Unterstützung von unseren Operationen verleugnet. Sie und Ihr Geschwader werden für Ihre Unfähigkeit bezahlen!"

2802, "Achte auf die Position aller Schiffe in der Gegend. Du kannst es dir nicht erlauben eins davon entkommen zu lassen. Vergesse nicht, deine Staffelpiloten einzusetzen."

2803, "Sie haben Ihr Operationszeitfenster überschritten, Pilot! Obwohl Sie Ihre Ziele in Ihrem $quoteFünf Minuten$quote-Fenster erfüllten, haben Sie es versäumt aus der Einsatzzone vor Ihrer Entdeckung abzufliegen. Sie haben unsere Geheimhaltung auffliegen lassen und die GTA könnte jetzt genügend Beweise haben, um den ursprünglichen Vorfall zu rekonstruieren. Sie haben ab jetzt dauerhaftes Flugverbot!"

2804, "Kehre innerhalb deines $quoteFünf Minuten$quote-Zeitfensters zur Basis zurück."

2805, "Sie haben Ihr Operationszeitfenster überschritten, Pilot! Mit der Entblößung dieser Mission haben Sie unseren Vertrag mit den Vasudanern aufs Spiel gesetzt und die GTA dazu verlasst die Unterstützung unserer Operationen zu verleugnen. Sie haben ab jetzt dauerhaftes Flugverbot!"

2806, "Schließe deine Mission innerhalb deines $quoteFünf Minuten$quote-Zeitfensters ab."

2807, "Sie hatten keine Genehmigung zur Basis zurückzukehren, Pilot! Ihre Handlungen haben nicht nur das Leben der- und diejenigen aufs Spiel gesetzt, welche an dieser Mission beteiligt waren, sondern auch die gesamten Ziele der GTA in diesem Einsatzgebiet. Bis ein Militärgericht anders entscheidet, werden Sie hiermit von Ihren Flügeln und allen Privilegien, die Ihnen als Offizier der Galaktisch Terranischen Allianz verliehen wurden, entbunden."

2846, "Sie sind mehrere Klicks entfernt. Bis sie dem Konvoi nahekommen, machen Sie sich um diese keine Sorgen."

2847, "Terranisches Wissenschaftsschiff Einstein ruft alle verbündeten Schiffe in dem Gebiet. Wir werden von shivanischen Jägern angegriffen! Fordern Hilfe an!"

2848, "Ein terranisches Schiff? Command, dies ist Sperrgebiet! Es sind keine anderen terranischen Schiffe in diesem Gebiet zugelassen!"

2849, "Wir werden das später klären, Chensit. Piloten, brechen Sie aus und helfen Sie der Einstein. Das ist ein Befehl!"

2850, "Was ist mit dem Konvoi?"

2851, "Wir sind im Moment in Sicherheit, Alpha. Unterstützen Sie Ihre eigenen Leute."

2852, "Es ist gut Sie zu sehen, Piloten. Wir haben bereits die zweite Jägerwelle angegriffen. Bitte unterstützen Sie uns."

2853, "Wie ist Ihr Status, Chensit?"

2854, "Wir haben kleinere Schäden erlitten. Unsere Formation schafft einen wirkungsvollen Jägerschirm, aber die Shivaner sind hartnäckig und zahlreich."

2855, "Wir haben das Gebiet gesichert, Command. Alle Banditen sind neutralisiert worden."

2856, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Halten Sie die Augen nach gegnerischen Schiffen offen. Die Jäger der Pinnacle werden in ein paar Minuten ankommen."

2857, "So, welche Art von Forschung machen Sie hier, Chensit?"

2858, "Das sind geheime Informationen, Beta 3."

2859, "Och, kommen Sie schon. Nur ein kleiner Tipp. Was ist in diesen Frachtbehältern? Waffen? Neue Subraumantriebe? Shivanische Technologien?"

2860, "Hören Sie doch auf, Beta! Sie wissen doch, dass Spione niemanden etwas erzählen."

2861, "Alles wird zu gegebener Zeit aufgedeckt, Pilot! Dieses Gebiet des Weltraums sollte sich für unsere wissenschaftlichen Bemühungen am ergiebigsten erweisen. Wir freuen uns darauf, unsere Erkenntnisse mit Ihnen zu teilen, wenn unsere Wissenschaftler auf der Pinnacle ihre Forschung abgeschlossen haben."

2862, "Eine weitere einfliegende Welle an Jägern. Greifen jetzt an."

2863, "Bomber springen mit Jägereskorte rein! Schalten Sie sie aus, bevor sie dem Konvoi Schaden zufügen können."

2864, "Die Bomber sind Geschichte! Gute Arbeit alle zusammen!"

2865, "Sieht so aus, als ob das der letzte dieser Welle war. Nehmen die Eskorte wieder auf."

2866, "Die Shivaner liefern uns nicht wirklich einen Kampf. Sehen Sie sich den Konvoi an -- dieser ist kaum berührt worden. Ich hätte gedacht, dass sie mehr Bomber einsetzen würden."

2867, "Sie sind nicht mehr die gleichen, seitdem wir die Lucifer ausgeschaltet haben. Es ist wie, als hätten sie ihren Kampfgeist verloren oder so. Nicht, dass ich mich beschweren würde."

2868, "Wir werden hier vernichtend geschlagen! Starten Fluchtkapseln! Piloten, beschützen Sie sie!"

2869, "Die Shivaner umschwärmen uns! Wir starten die Fluchtkapseln! Piloten, beschützen Sie sie!"

2870, "Wir haben die Einstein verloren!"

2871, "Verfolgen jetzt Einsteins Fluchtkapseln. Alpha und Beta, halten Sie sich für weitere Befehle bereit."

2872, "Piloten, Ihr neues Ziel ist es, die Fluchtkapseln zu bergen. Wir werden Verstärkungen einsetzen, um den vasudanischen Konvoi zu beschützen. Übertragen Ihnen jetzt die Sprungkoordinaten."

2873, "Der Spieler soll die Fluchtkapseln der Einstein beschützen, bis sie geborgen werden können."

2874, "Wir haben die Fluchtkapseln der Einstein zu einem abgelegenen Ort innerhalb des Deneb-Systems verfolgt. Wie Sie wissen, sind Fluchtkapseln der Hermes-Klasse mit einem einfachen Subraumantrieb ausgestattet, welcher nur einmal verwendet werden kann, bevor dieser ersetzt werden muss. Dies erfordert den Einsatz eines Bergungsschiffes, dass die Kapseln in seinen Hangar aufnehmen kann.

Die Wildheit des shivanischen Angriffes ließ den Fluchtkapseln nur wenig Zeit, um die Sprungkoordinaten zu berechnen und zwang sie zum ersten verfügbaren Ziel zu springen. Obwohl sie nicht in unmittelbarer Gefahr schweben, wird es einige Zeit dauern, bis verbündete Streitkräfte zur Unterstützung eingesetzt werden können. Ihre Staffeln wurde der Schutz der Kapseln zugewiesen, bis diese geborgen werden können.

Die Stärke der shivanischen Streitkräfte in diesem System ist nicht bekannt. Wir glauben nicht, dass sie sich mit den Fluchtkapseln beschäftigen, allerdings kann die Ankunft von zwei Jägerstaffeln sie wahrscheinlich aufmerksam machen. Zerstören Sie jedes shivanische Schiff, welches Ihren Missionszielen im Wege steht."

2875, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Sie haben die Bergung der beiden Fluchtkapseln, trotz der Verwirrung und des unerwarteten Ausgangs, erfolgreich sichergestellt. Das Personal an Bord der Kapsel, die wir geborgen haben, wird gerade eingehend befragt und ihre Verletzungen, die sie während der Schlacht erlitten haben, werden gerade behandelt.

Das Oberkommando hat auf unsere Anfragen, bezüglich der Anwesenheit der Repulse im Einsatzgebiet der Krios noch nicht geantwortet, so dass General Scott diesen Vorfall vorerst als Sicherheitsverstoß behandelt. Sie werden auf den Laufenden gebracht, soweit wir weitere Informationen erhalten.

Leider ist dies nicht der einzige Fleck auf dem heutigen GTI-Einsatz. Nicht nur wurde unsere Bergungsoperation beeinträchtigt, sondern das Oberkommando hat die Bedrohung für unsere gemeinsame Operation im Asteroidengürtel grob unterschätzt."

2876, "Es scheint, dass die shivanische Anwesenheit in diesem System größer ist, als wir ursprünglich angenommen haben. Nicht nur wurde unsere Bergungsoperation beeinträchtigt, sondern das Oberkommando hat die Bedrohung für unsere gemeinsame Operation im Asteroidengürtel grob unterschätzt."

2877, "Seien Sie froh, dass Sie nicht dort gewesen sind, Piloten! Die Shivaner starteten einen grausamen Angriff, der nicht nur unsere Verstärkungen auslöschte, sondern auch den gesamten vasudanischen Konvoi! Als die Jäger der Pinnacle ankamen, fanden sie zwischen den Trümmern nur ein paar beschädigte Frachtbehälter. Diese Behälter wurden zwar einsatzfähig geborgen, allerdings wurden unersetzliche Materialien und Forschungen an Bord der Schiffe und den anderen Behältern zerstört.

General Scott hat eine formale Entschuldigung an den vasudanischen Geheimdienst für unser Versagen, den Konvoi zu beschützen, übermittelt. Obwohl die Vasudaner über diesen Vorfall zu Recht verärgert sind, haben sie sich glücklicherweise dazu entschieden, diesen uns nicht vorzuhalten. Sie haben darauf hingewiesen, dass die shivanische Bedrohung zu groß ist, um die Allianz wegen solcher Angelegenheiten zu gefährden. Sobald die Shivaner neutralisiert wurden, können unsere Spezies wirksamer die Aufmerksamkeit auf Forschung und Wiederaufbau legen."

2878, "Befolge deine Befehle, bleibe aber aufmerksam. Dinge sind vielleicht nicht so, wie sie scheinen."

2879, "Leider teilt das Oberkommando den Optimismus der Vasudaner über das Ergebnis der heutigen Ereignisse nicht. Der GTI hat eine formale Untersuchung über diesen Vorfall gestartet und Sie haben für die Dauer der Untersuchung Flugverbot."

2880, "Halte ein Auge auf deine Radaranzeige, so dass du ausbrechen und die Shivaner angreifen kannst, sobald sie ankommen. Die Brahma-Staffel stellt die größte Bedrohung für das Überleben der Fluchtkapseln dar."

2881, "Zerstöre Kali"

2882, "Verteidige die Fluchtkapseln, bis sie geborgen werden können"

2883, "Verteidige die Repulse und die Krios"

2884, "In Ordnung, ich erfasse die Fluchtkapseln auf 2500 Metern. Fliege in Eskortformation."

2885, "Sieht so aus, als wären die Shivaner ihnen nicht hierher gefolgt. Das ist ein gutes Zeichen."

2886, "Einstein-Fluchtkapseln, hier ist Beta 1 der 91. Phantoms von der GTD Krios. Wir haben Befehle, Ihre Schiffe zu beschützen. Bitte bestätigen Sie!"

2887, "Bestätigt, Beta, wir halten uns bereit. Wir freuen uns über Ihre Hilfe."

2888, "Ich habe unsere Koordinaten der Krios übermittelt. Es wird eine Weile dauern, bis sie hier ist, also müssen wir ein bisschen abwarten."

2889, "Großartig. Ich hoffe nur, dass der Konvoi in Ordnung ist, während wir weg sind. Vierzig Besatzungsmitglieder für ein Dutzend Frachter mit Fracht ist nicht meine Vorstellung von einem fairen Geschäft."

2890, "Ich würde mir keine Sorgen machen. Dieser Konvoi schien ziemlich gut beschützt zu sein -- es würde einen wirklich großen oder koordinierten Angriff benötigen, um durch diesen Turmschirm zu kommen. Außerdem sagte Command, dass Verstärkungen auf dem Weg wären."

2891, "Sieht so aus, als hätten uns die Shivaner gefunden. Ausbrechen und Angreifen!"

2892, "Wir haben die Fluchtkapseln verloren!"

2893, "An alle: Zurück zur Basis. Hier können wir nichts Anderes mehr tun."

2894, "Hier ist die GTD Repulse. Wir haben Befehle, die Fluchtkapseln zu bergen."

2895, "Sieht so aus, als hätte die Repulse die shivanische Aufmerksamkeit. Sie erfassen nicht länger die Kapseln."

2896, "Einfliegende shivanische Bomber! Lassen Sie sie nicht in die Nähe der Repulse kommen!"

2897, "Es kommen noch mehr Bomber an! Sie erfassen die Krios!"

2898, "Staffeln Iota und Kappa kehren zur Basis zurück. Die Operation war ein voller Erfolg."

2899, "Bestätigt, Pilot! Unterstützen Sie jetzt Alpha und Beta. Sobald die Überlebenden der Einstein an Bord sind, sichern Sie das Gebiet."

2900, "Verstanden, Sir."

2901, "Was ist mit diesen neuen Jägern? Ich kann keinen von ihnen erfassen."

2902, "Muss ein neuer F&E-Prototyp sein. Ich wusste nicht, dass Sie Tarntechnologien haben. Sie bekommen immer als erstes die Hände an die ganzen coolen Sachen."

2903, "Hoppla -- Ich kann jetzt Iota und Kappa erfassen. Diese Tarnjäger scheinen noch ein paar Fehler zu haben."

2904, "GTD Krios ist jetzt auf Position. Beginnen mit der Kapselbergung."

2905, "Warten Sie mal eine Minute, wer, vermeintlich, soll uns aufnehmen?"

2906, "Warten Sie -- wir haben hier eine Situation. Piloten, wir starten weitere Jäger, um Sie zu unterstützen. Halten Sie die Shivaner von den Kapseln fern!"

2907, "Alle Feinde sind neutralisiert worden. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten!"

2908, "Jetzt zu der vorliegenden Sache. General Glaive, was tun Sie hier in diesem System? Ist die Repulse gegenwärtig nicht Antares zugewiesen?"

2909, "Ich könnte Ihnen die gleiche Frage stellen, General Scott. Uns wurde befohlen direkt zu diesen Koordinaten zu fliegen, um einen Satz an Rettungskapseln aufzunehmen."

2910, "Während wir Ihre Unterstützung sehr schätzen, Sir, gibt es Ihnen nicht das Recht unsere Mission zu stören. Beide Flucht--"

2911, "Weder sind wir hier, um Unterstützung zu leisten, noch stören wir Ihre Mission, General. Wir sind hier, um die Kapseln aufzunehmen! Das Oberkommando hat uns befohlen, ihren sicheren und sofortigen Transport nach Beta Aquilae sicherzustellen. Ihre Beteiligung ist nicht länger erforderlich."

2912, "Wir haben keine Benachrichtigung über diese Befehle erhalten."

2913, "Trotzdem wurden diese Befehle gegeben. Sie werden die zweite Fluchtkapsel von Ihrem Jägerhangar sofort zu unserem überführen."

2914, "Mit allem nötigen Respekt, General Glaive. Ich nehme nur Befehle vom Oberkommando der GTA entgegen. Ich werde diese Kapsel weder auf die Repulse noch irgendwo anders hin ohne deren ausdrückliche Genehmigung überführen."

2915, "Wie Sie wünschen. Sehen Sie zu, dass Sie sie sofort kontaktieren, um diese Angelegenheit zu klären. In der Zwischenzeit haben wir woanders Dinge zu erledigen. GTD Repulse Ende."

2916, "Der Spieler soll Iota durch ein Asteroidenfeld zu einem geheimen GTI-Treffen eskortieren."

2917, "Der $f Nachrichtendienst hat um die Hilfe unseres Geschwaders gebeten, um einen Konvoi zu einem geheimen Frachtaustausch zu eskortieren. Der Konvoi besteht aus drei Schiffen: Der $f GTC $f Adamant und zwei geladenen Frachtern. Alle drei transportieren wichtige Güter und Forschungsarbeiten. Um eine Entdeckung zu vermeiden, befindet sich der Treffpunkt innerhalb eines dichten Asteroidenfeldes."

2918, "Wachgeschütze sind am Zielort aufgestellt worden, aber der Konvoi benötigt noch Schutz, bis er die Sicherheitszone erreicht. Die Staffeln $f Alpha und $f Beta werden alle Asteroiden in seinem Weg zerstören. Sobald der Konvoi die Sicherheitszone erreicht hat, kehren Sie zur Basis zurück."

2919, "Der Nachrichtendienst vermutet, dass shivanische Reste das Asteroidenfeld vielleicht als Sammelgebiet benutzen. Wenn irgendwelche $h Shivaner den Konvoi bedrohen, zerstören Sie sie sofort."

2920, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Der gesamte Konvoi hat es zur Sicherheitszone geschafft. Die Forschung an Bord dieser Schiffe wird uns in diesem Kampf gegen die Shivaner sehr helfen. Sie sind für Ihre Sorgfalt bei der Erreichung Ihrer Ziele, trotz der gefährlichen Umgebung, zu loben."

2921, "Die Adamant und einer der Frachter hat es zur Sicherheitszone geschafft. Leider wurde der andere Frachter zerstört. Dieses Schiff hatte wichtige Güter und Forschungsarbeiten an Bord und jetzt müssen wir dem auskommen, was wir haben.

In Anbetracht der Gefahren der Umgebung war Ihre Leistung zufriedenstellend. Allerdings möchte ich Sie daran erinnern, dass Offiziere des GTI an einem höheren Standard gemessen werden, als die der GTA. In Zukunft erwarten wir eine bessere Leistung."

2922, "Lasse dich nicht von den Shivanern ablenken. Deine erste Priorität ist es, den Konvoi vor den Asteroiden zu beschützen, also bleibe in seiner Nähe."

2923, "Die shivanische Bomberklasse, der Sie begegnet sind, wurde als Seraphim bezeichnet. Ihre Scans werden bei der Bestimmung seiner Fähigkeiten hilfreich sein. Unsere Wissenschaftler werden die Ergebnisse der Datenanalyse in Kürze vorstellen."

2924, "Diese Mission war ein Fehlschlag. Wegen des Schadens durch Asteroiden und shivanischen Angriffen, wurden beide Frachter zerstört. Wir haben wichtige Güter und Forschungsarbeiten verloren, die uns in der Zukunft sehr geholfen hätten.

Der Nachrichtendienst ist sehr verärgert. General Tess hat darum gebeten, dass Sie zurück auf die GTD Intrepid versetzt werden und ich hatte keine andere Wahl, als dieser Bitte zu entsprechen. Ihr Transporter fliegt morgen um 13:30 Uhr ab."

2925, "Es kann schwierig sein bei all den Jägern, Bombern und anderen Gefahren in dem Gebiet den Durchblick zu behalten, aber versuche zuerst die Asteroiden auszuschalten. Diese verursachen die größten Schäden am Konvoi und sollten daher deine erste Priorität sein."

2926, "Die GTC Adamant ist zerstört worden, bevor sie die Sicherheitszone erreichte. Tausende an Leben gingen aufgrund Ihrer schlechten Leistung verloren."

2927, "Die GTC Adamant und einer der Frachter wurde zerstört, bevor sie es zur Sicherheitszone geschafft haben. Wir haben wichtige Vorräte und Forschungsarbeiten verloren, die uns in der Zukunft sehr geholfen hätten."

2928, "Der gesamte Konvoi wurde zerstört, bevor er es zur Sicherheitszone schaffte. Wir haben wichtige Vorräte und Forschungsarbeiten verloren, die uns in der Zukunft sehr geholfen hätten."

2929, "Ohne die Materialien und dem Personal an Bord der Adamant, wird der GTI dazu gezwungen sein, mehrere wichtige Projekte zu verschieben. General Tess hat eine formelle Untersuchung angefordert.

Ich bedauere, Ihnen mitteilen zu müssen, dass Sie bis zu Ihrer vorläufigen Anhörung Flugverbot haben. Wegtreten!"

2940, "Der Konvoi ist jetzt in der Sicherheitszone. Räumen Sie die restlichen Feinde weg und kehren Sie zur Basis zurück."

2941, "Erfasse eine Staffel an shivanischen Bombern, unbekannte Konfiguration. Was halten Sie davon, Command?"

2942, "Die Schiffe scheinen schwere Bomber mit erheblicher Bombenkapazität zu sein. Wenn möglich abfangen und scannen."

2943, "Scanübertragung erhalten, Alpha 1. Setzen Sie Ihre Mission fort."

2944, "Schöner Ort für ein Treffen. Genießt der Nachrichtendienst die Reparatur von Asteroidenschäden?"

2945, "Bleiben Sie wachsam, Piloten! Wir fliegen jetzt in das Feld ein."

2946, "Überall Asteroiden und Shivaner! Die Adamant nimmt schwere Schäden! Fordern Verstärkungen an!"

$b * $b Antares-System
$b * $b 01. $b Mai $b 2335

$b Nachrichten $b von $b der $b Front

Das GTA-Oberkommando freut sich, einen großen Sieg in unserem Krieg gegen die Shivaner verkünden zu können. Eine gemeinsame terranisch-vasudanische Eingreiftruppe hat eine große Ansammlung shivanischer Streitkräfte in Antares niedergeschmettert, wobei die SD Demiurge und eine große Anzahl an Unterstützungskreuzern und Frachtdepots zerstört wurden. Mit der Beseitigung dieses Aktivitätsmittelpunktes, wurde die shivanische Armada in mehrere kleinere Sekundärflotten im gesamten bekannten Raum verstreut. Der Sieg über die Shivaner, obwohl nicht unmittelbar bevorstehend, scheint in Sicht zu sein.

Sowohl die GTA als auch die PVN bewegen sich schnell, um ihre Positionen zu sichern und den Vorteil auszunutzen. Die GTD Minnow ist nach Beta Cygni und Betelgeuse eingesetzt worden, während die PVD Hope auf dem Weg nach Vasuda und Alpha Centauri ist. Die Krios kehrt jedoch nach Antares zurück, um das shivanische Verhalten zu überwachen und mehrere Piratengruppierungen zu untersuchen, die nach der Niederlage der Shivaner aufgetaucht sind."

2951, "$b Der $b Deneb-Vorfall

Das terranische Oberkommando hat uns mitgeteilt, dass die Verwechslung bei der Bergung der Rettungskapseln in Deneb auf einen Zusammenbruch der Kommunikation zurückzuführen war. Missverständnisse und bürokratische Fehler wie diese plagen die GTI-Befehlsstruktur leider schon seit dem Verlust der GTD Legion vor einigen Monaten. Sowohl die Repulse als auch die Krios wurden versehentlich der gleichen Operation zugewiesen und die Repulse kam einfach zuerst an. Die erste Fluchtkapsel landete im Hangar der Repulse, während das verwirrte Personal der zweiten Kapsel auf der Krios landete.

Nachdem die Krios die Bestätigung über die Befehle der Repulse bekam, wurde die Fluchtkapsel und ihre Insassen nach Beta Aquilae überführt. Das terranische Oberkommando hat alle offiziellen Aufzeichnungen über ihr Verfahren zu diesem Thema als geheim eingestuft."

2952, "$b Die $b Einstein

In Mangel von weiteren Informationen untersucht die Krios weiterhin das Auftauchen der Einstein im Deneb-System. Nach Dienstprotokollen wurde die Einstein während der ersten shivanischen Begegnung in Ross 128 als zerstört gemeldet. Die Einstein flog drei Tage vor dem Angriff in das System ein, um eine routinemäßige geologische Untersuchung durchzuführen.

Es ist offensichtlich, dass die Anwesenheit der Einstein in Deneb, während einer unserer letzten Operationen, dem offiziellen Bericht widerspricht."

2953, "$b Fortsetzung $b des $b Berichtes $b über $b die $b Einstein

Vor ihrer angeblichen Zerstörung in Ross 128 stand die Einstein unter dem Kommando von Oberst Ezra Tycho, einer hochrangigen GTI-Offizierin. Obwohl die offiziellen Pflichten auf niedrigstufige planetarische Studien beschränkt waren, könnte die Einstein in verdeckte Operationen und Waffenforschungen beteiligt gewesen sein.

Das Auftauchen der Einstein in solch einer Hochsicherheitsregion des Weltraums ist in der Tat beunruhigend. Die Analyse der Flugmuster des Schiffes zeigen an, dass sie einen hochstufigen Scan des Bereichs im und um das Deneb-Asteroidenfeld durchführte. Die Einstein wäre in einer idealen Position gewesen, um die Aktivitäten aller vasudanischen Forschungskonvois in diesem Gebiet zu beobachten und aufzuzeichnen.

Der Zweck für diese Scans, sowie der Daten, die die Einstein sammelte bleibt unbekannt. Unsere kurzen Verhöre mit den Überlebenden der Einstein lieferten nur wenig nützliche Informationen zu diesem Thema, da der Großteil der Kommandobesatzung an Bord der Fluchtkapsel war, die von der Repulse aufgenommen wurde."

2954, "$b Neue $b shivanische $b Technologie: $b SB $b Seraphim

Die jüngsten Gefechte mit shivanischen Streitkräften haben die Existenz einer neuen Klasse an Bombern offenbart, die wir als Seraphim bezeichnet haben. Der Seraphim scheint in den meisten Punkten dem Nephilim ähnlich zu sein, außer dass er vier weitere primäre Waffenhaltungen aufweist und seine Sekundärkapazität um etwa 50% größer ist. Wie der Nephilim ist der Seraphim ein gefährlicher Feind. Piloten wird empfohlen eine Waffe mit schwerer Schildschadenswirkung, wie beispielsweise die Banshee, in Einsatzgebieten zu bestücken, wo diese Bomber erwartet werden.

Wir sind uns nicht sicher, warum die Shivaner bis jetzt damit warteten, den Seraphim einzuführen. Sein Einsatz während der Hochzeit des großen Krieges hätte das Gleichgewicht in einer Reihe von engen Gefechten verschieben können. Jetzt aber scheint den Shivaner die Entschlusskraft zu fehlen, um sie wirkungsvoll zu verwenden."

2955, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTF $b Loki

Forschung und Entwicklung hat die Feldtests ihres neusten Tarnjägerprototypen, dem GTF Loki, abgeschlossen. Mit einer hohen Höchstgeschwindigkeit und ausgezeichneter Manövrierfähigkeit ist der Loki hauptsächlich als Aufklärungsjäger entworfen. Seine abgeschirmte Reaktorkammer und die kompakte Hülle geben ihm ein geringes Sensorprofil, welches ihm ermöglicht, sich der Entdeckung durch feindliche Streitkräfte zu entziehen. Gemäß den Vorschriften wird der integrierte IFF-Transponder der Loki ein verschlüsseltes Signal aussenden, um die Erfassung durch festgelegte freundliche Einheiten zu ermöglichen.

Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ist der Loki ausschließlich auf GTI-Piloten beschränkt. Kein Pilot im standardmäßigen GTA-Jägerkorps hat, bis auf weiteres, die Genehmigung den Loki zu fliegen."

2956, "Vor etwa einer Stunde starteten Piratenräuber einen Angriff auf den $f Talus $f Partikelbeschleunigerkomplex in Antares. Diese Einrichtung beherbergt die streng geheimen GTI-Waffenforschungslabore und ist für die Kriegsanstrengungen von größter strategischer Bedeutung."

2957, "Einige der Forschungsmodule der Station, die bereits von vorherigen shivanischen Angriffen beschädigt wurden, haben während des Gefechts die Eindämmung verloren und verursachten eine große Explosion, die die Station angeschlagen hat und praktisch jedes Schiff in der unmittelbaren Umgebung zerstörte, einschließlich der Angriffsstreitmacht der Piraten sowie die Verteidigungsanlagen der Einrichtung."

2958, "Das einzige, was übriggeblieben ist, ist der stark angeschlagene Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse $f GTC $f Leto sowie auch Frachtbehälter mit entscheidenden Waffenforschungen. Diese Informationen sind äußerst empfindlich und müssen sofort geborgen werden."

2959, "Da die Sicherheit dieses Sektors stark beeinträchtigt wurde, werden GTI-Streitkräfte die Materialien an einen sicheren Ort bringen. Bis Reparaturen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt abgeschlossen werden können, wird die Station das gesamte Personal evakuieren. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, sicherzustellen, dass diese Operation reibungslos verläuft."

2960, "Wegen des Verlustes der Stationsverteidigung ist die Kontrolle über dieses Gebiet äußerst dürftig. Wir erwarten, dass die Piraten zurückkehren und möglicherweise versuchen die Waffenprototypen während ihres Abtransports zu beschlagnahmen. Dies müssen Sie um jeden Preis verhindern!"

2961, "Halten Sie das Gebiet sicher, bis Verstärkungen ankommen. Ein Reparaturtransporter wird versuchen, die Systeme der Leto wieder in Betrieb zu nehmen, um bei Ihrer Verteidigung zu helfen, allerdings kann es einige Zeit dauern, bis dies erreicht werden kann. Command wird weitere Jäger einsetzen, sobald die Notwendigkeit entsteht."

2962, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Die Waffenprototypen wurden mit allen Aufzeichnungen erfolgreich geborgen. Diese Leistung wird sich für die Kriegsanstrengungen als unschätzbar erweisen."

2963, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Es wurde genug Sprengkopfmaterial geborgen, um zu ermöglichen unsere vorherige Forschung zu rekonstruieren. Der GTI sollte in der Lage sein, verlorenen Boden innerhalb weniger Wochen wiedergutzumachen."

2964, "Sie haben dabei versagt, die Bergung von genügend Behältern sicherzustellen, damit wir unser Waffenprogramm rekonstruieren können. Ohne diese Materialien und Prototypen wurde unsere Fähigkeit, Krieg gegen die Shivaner zu führen, beeinträchtigt."

2965, "Vergesse alles bis auf die Frachter und Fracht. Beschütze sie um jeden Preis."

2966, "Diese Mission war eine einzige Katastrophe! Wegen Ihrer Unachtsamkeit ist die empfindlichste Waffenforschung des GTI jetzt in den Händen von Piraten. Dieser Fehlschlag wird uns viel kosten. Sie sind bis auf weiteres abgelöst!"

2967, "Scanne die Kappas so bald wie möglich. Deine Staffelpiloten werden dir aushelfen, wenn sie wissen, auf wen sie schießen sollen."

2968, "Sie haben auch dabei geholfen das Wissenschaftlerkontingent der Station zu retten. Jedes gerettete Leben ist entscheidend für die Kriegsanstrengung. Sie sind für Ihre Fähigkeiten bei der Erfüllung Ihrer Ziele zu loben."

2969, "Wir freuen uns, dass die GTC Leto diesen Einsatz überstanden hat. Mit ein paar Tagen Reparatur im Trockendock und einer neuen Besatzung wird sie schon bald wieder in den aktiven Dienst zurückkehren können. Großartige Arbeit beim Schutz eines wertvollen Flottenmittels."

2970, "Da der Sektor jetzt sicher ist, haben bereits die Reparaturarbeiten am Talus-Labor begonnen. Die GTI erwartet, dass die Station innerhalb dieses Monats wieder in Betrieb ist."

2993, "Streichen Sie eine Piratenbande."

2994, "Schien ein wenig zu einfach, wenn du mich fragst. Etwas sagt mir, dass wir noch nicht den letzten von ihnen gesehen haben."

2995, "Ankommende Shivaner! Sieht so aus, als hätten sie entschieden, uneingeladen zur Party zu kommen."

2996, "Hier ist Kappa 1, wir fordern Unterstützung an! Piraten sind in der Verfolgung. Ihre Frachter übertragen gestohlene IFF-Signale. Decken Sie uns!"

2997, "Kappa-Staffel fliegt rein, um die -- was zur Hölle? Command, wir haben hier eine nicht genehmigte Staffel!"

2998, "Ankommende Seraphim-Bomber! Beschützen Sie die Frachter! Wir werden später herausfinden, wer wer ist."

2999, "Piloten, wir können es uns nicht leisten, diese Fracht zu verlieren! Versuchen Sie bei Ihrer ersten Gelegenheit einen Scan von mindestens einem Frachter von jeder Kappa-Staffel zu erhalten."

3000, "Wir bereiten die Delta-Staffel zur Unterstützung vor. Halten Sie sich bereit."

3001, "IFFs geklärt. Delta-Staffel, zerstören Sie die Piratenfrachter!"

3002, "Sie haben einen der Frachtbehälter gestohlen! Piloten, passen Sie auf!"

3003, "Die Fracht ist gesichert. Gute Arbeit, Piloten!"

3004, "Die gesamte Fracht wurde geborgen. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!"

3005, "GTC Iapetus und GTC Python jetzt auf Position. Piloten, Sie sind abgelöst."

3006, "GTC Leto fliegt jetzt ab. Vielen Dank für die Deckung, Piloten!"

3007, "Derjenige, der den Tiger reitet"

3008, "Eine routinemäßige Eskortmission endet tödlich, als die GTI die Kontrolle über ihre brisante Fracht verliert."

3009, "Nach der Sicherstellung des Talus Partikelbeschleunigerkomplexes ist das $b Antares$| -System fast vollständig gesichert. Die restliche Piratenaktivität ist fast nichtexistent und die shivanische Anwesenheit in diesem System ist zu zerstreut und zu unorganisiert, um eine ernsthafte Bedrohung darzustellen."

3010, "Nachdem der Druck auf unsere Kernsysteme nachgelassen hat, beginnt der GTI mit der Intensivierung der Erforschung und Entwicklung neuer Technologien. Mehrere wichtige Projekte stehen kurz vor der Fertigstellung und der GTI hat beschlossen, sie nach $b Beta $b Aquilae zu bringen, wo ihre Ergebnisse genauer überwacht werden können."

3011, "In dieser Mission werden Sie beauftragt, einen GTI-Wissenschaftskonvoi zu überwachen, der seine Fracht nach Beta Aquilae überführt. Der Konvoi besteht aus drei Kreuzern der Faustus-Klasse: Der $f GTSC $f Moreau$| , der $f GTSC $f Idun und der $f GTSC $f Ratna$| . Diese Kreuzer haben Forschungen und Prototypen für das $b Eumenides-Projekt an Bord, dem streng geheimsten Waffenprogramm des GTI."

3012, "Sie werden die Kreuzer bis zum $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-Sprungknoten eskortieren. Nach dem Erreichen von Beta Aquilae, wird eine zweite Eskorte den Kreuzern zustoßen, die sie zu einem geheimen Ort bringen werden."

3013, "Wegen der äußerst empfindlichen Besonderheit dieses Konvois, weisen wir drei Staffeln zu, um ihn zu beschützen. Wir glauben aber nicht, dass Sie auf erheblichen Widerstand stoßen werden. Wegen der Seltenheit von Shivanern in diesem System, scheinen die verbliebenen Schiffe nicht in der Lage zu sein, ihre Angriffe wirksam zu koordinieren."

3014, "Wie immer wird der GTI da sein, um Ihren Fortschritt zu überwachen. Viel Glück!"

3015, "Sie hatten den eindeutigen Befehl Ihre Eskorte der Ratna aufrechtzuerhalten, Pilot! Ihre Dienstverletzung hat dem GTI viele Monate der Forschung und eine unschätzbare Technologie, die an Bord des Schiffes waren, gekostet.

In der GTA ist die Desertation ein Grund für das Militärgericht. Aber Offiziere des Galaktisch Terranischen Geheimdienst werden an einem viel höheren Standard gemessen und Ihre Feigheit auf so einer wichtigen Mission ist unentschuldbar.

Sie werden hier auf der Repulse, bis zu Ihrer Hinrichtung um 19:00 Uhr, in Haft bleiben. Ihre Vorgesetzten auf der Krios werden darüber informiert, dass Sie während der Mission getötet wurden."

3016, "Wenn du in einer engen Situation bist, bitte deine Staffelpiloten darum, dir auszuhelfen. Verstärkungen werden ankommen, kurz nachdem die Abaddon reingesprungen ist."

3017, "Pilot, dieser Fehlschlag ist unentschuldbar! Der gesamte Konvoi ist verloren gegangen und die Shivaner haben jetzt unsere empfindlichste neue Technologie! Sie haben uns ganz alleine Monate an Forschungen gekostet und Sie haben unsere gesamte strategische Initiative an die Shivaner übergeben!

Sie werden bis zu Ihrer Hinrichtung um 19:00 Uhr auf der Repulse in Haft bleiben. Ich versichere Ihnen, dass das nicht schön sein wird."

3018, "Sei schnell, um die shivanischen Transporter zu zerstören, bevor sie an der Ratna andocken können. Bleibe in der Nähe des Bauches der Abaddon, denn es ist nur ein kurzer Hüpfer vom Hangar zum Kreuzer."

3019, "Pilot, dieser Fehlschlag ist unentschuldbar! Ihre Unfähigkeit hat uns Monate an Forschungen gekostet und hat uns um Jahre in unseren Bemühungen zurückgeworfen, die Shivaner zu verstehen. Der GTI erwartet von seinen Piloten erstklassige Leistungen und Ihr entsetzlicher Fehlschlag auf so einer wichtigen Mission hat Ihre Karriere endgültig beendet.

Sie werden hier auf der Repulse, bis zu Ihrer Hinrichtung um 19:00 Uhr, in Haft bleiben. Ihre Vorgesetzten auf der Krios werden darüber informiert, dass Sie während der Mission getötet wurden."

3020, "Achte auf die Hüllenintegrität der Ratna. Halte auch die Schiffe im Auge, die die Frachter angreifen, da jeder verstreute Schuss die Ratna treffen kann."

3021, "Gut gemacht, Piloten! Trotz des heftigen Widerstandes konnte der GTI die Ratna und ihre Fracht bergen. Shivanische Strategien sind schwer vorherzusagen und wir hatten nicht erwartet, dass sie einen Zerstörer schicken, um einen einfachen Wissenschaftskreuzer zu kapern."

3022, "Die Zerstörung der SD Abaddon ist ein schwerer Schlag für die Shivaner. Ihre Leistung in dieser Operation war höchst beeindruckend."

3023, "Laut Berichten aus Beta Aquilae erhielt der GTI genügend Forschungsdaten, um das Eumenides-Projekt, wie ursprünglich geplant, fortzusetzen. Von dieser Technologie wird die GTA in unserem Kampf gegen die Shivaner immens profitieren. Forschung und Entwicklung schätzt, dass die erste dieser Waffen der nächsten Generation, die EMP-Rakete, innerhalb dieses Monats für Feldversuche zur Verfügung stehen wird.

Ich wurde vom Oberkommando darüber informiert, dass die Flugaufzeichnungen für diese Mission auf Geheimhaltungsstufe Omega klassifiziert worden sind. Als solche bin ich verpflichtet, Sie darüber zu informieren, dass jegliche Informationen, die über diese Mission direkt oder indirekt an Personen ausgeplaudert werden, die nicht ausdrücklich vom Galaktisch Terranischen Geheimdienst genehmigt wurden, eine verräterische Straftat ist, welche mit dem Tode bestraft wird.

Das ist alles. Wegtreten!"

3041, "Piloten, seien Sie wachsam! Die Fracht auf diesen Kreuzern ist für den GTI sehr wertvoll."

3042, "Ankommende shivanische Staffel! Nehmen Sie die Füße vom Armaturenbrett, Piloten, wir haben Banditen abzuschießen!"

3051, "Brücke! Command! Sie sind weg! Sie sind entkommen!"

3057, "Command! Hilfe! Bringen Sie uns hier raus!"

3058, "Etwas ist auf meinem Jäger gelandet! Ich kann nicht --*"

3059, "Piloten, wir überarbeiten Ihre Missionsziele. Halten Sie Ihre Eskorte der Ratna aufrecht. Halten Sie sich für weitere Befehle bereit."

3060, "Scheiß drauf, Command! Was geht hier vor sich? Was haben Sie in diesen Kreuzern gemacht?"

3061, "Piloten, Sie dürfen nicht zulassen, dass die Shivaner die Kontrolle über die Ratna erlangen. Beschützten Sie sie um jeden Preis!"

3062, "Mit was denn? Stöcken? Sie umschwärmen uns! Zerstören Sie die Ratna und lassen Sie uns hier raus!"

3063, "Negativ, Piloten! Halten Sie Ihre Positionen aufrecht -- das ist ein direkter Befehl! Verstärkungen werden in Kürze verfügbar sein."

3064, "Piloten, ein shivanischer Transporter ist auf dem Weg, mit der Ratna anzudocken! Zerstören Sie ihn umgehend!"

3065, "Ein zweiter Transporter hat die Andockbucht der Abaddon verlassen! Zerstören Sie ihn, bevor er mit der Ratna andocken kann!"

3066, "Ein dritter shivanischer Transporter ist angekommen. Erlauben Sie es ihm nicht, mit der Ratna anzudocken!"

3067, "Wir starten die Staffeln Delta und Epsilon zur Unterstützung. Halten Sie sich bereit."

3068, "Die Iota-Staffel wird versuchen, die Abaddon zu entwaffnen und zu deaktivieren. Verwenden Sie diese Ablenkung zu Ihrem Vorteil."

3069, "Die Abaddon wurde zerstört! Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!"

3070, "Die Maelstrom wurde zerstört!"

3071, "Wir haben die Wormwood zerstört!"

3072, "Piloten, wir müssen die Ratna einsatzfähig bergen! Wir setzen Lambda 1 ein, um den Kreuzer nach Beta Aquilae zu schleppen."

3073, "Lambda 1 wurde abgeschossen! Wir bereiten Lambda 2 vor."

3074, "Lambda 2 wurde zerstört! Wir schicken Lambda 3 raus."

3075, "Wir werden angegriffen! Piloten, bitte unterstützen!"

3076, "Wir kassieren Treffer! Bitte geben Sie uns Deckung!"

3077, "Die Ratna wurde gekapert! Kehren Sie sofort zur Basis zurück!"

3078, "Wir haben die Ratna verloren! Piloten, kehren Sie sofort zur Basis zurück!"

3079, "Wir haben mit der Ratna angedockt. Fliegen weiter zum Sprungknoten."

3080, "Wir haben mit der Ratna angedockt. Decken Sie uns, Piloten."

3081, "Die Ratna ist sicher auf ihrem Weg nach Beta Aquilae. Gute Arbeit, Piloten!"

3082, "GTD Repulse jetzt auf Position. Piloten, warten Sie ab! Hilfe ist auf dem Weg."

3083, "All dies für einen kleinen Wissenschaftskreuzer? Was in aller Welt hat er an Bord?"

3084, "Piloten, wir starten die Kappa-Staffel, um die Abaddon zu zerstören. Geben Sie Deckung!"

3085, "Kappa-Staffel wurde zerstört! Zurück zur Basis, Piloten -- es gibt nichts mehr, was wir hier tun können."

3086, "Command, was macht ein ZERSTÖRER DER DEMON-KLASSE in Antares?!?"

3087, "Piloten, greifen Sie die Abaddon NICHT an. Halten Sie nach wie vor die vollständige Eskorte für die Ratna aufrecht!"

3088, "Schauen Sie sich dieses Ding an! Es umarmt die Ratna wie ein Baby!"

3089, "Die Ratna ist außerhalb der Reichweite der Abaddon! Piloten, bleiben Sie nah beim Frachter und stellen Sie sicher, dass er sicher rausspringt. Wir werden die Abaddon für Sie ablenken."

3090, "Übermitteln jetzt die Sprungkoordinaten. Alle Schiffe, kehren Sie zur Basis zurück!"

3091, "Der GTI beginnt ihre Offensive gegen die Shivaner. Der erste Schritt ist, eine Reihe an Frachtkonvois anzugreifen."

$b Die $b Shivaner

Vasudanische Streitkräfte haben Vasuda, Deneb und Sirius gesichert, während terranische Streitkräfte an der Vega- sowie Betelgeuse-Front rasche Fortschritte machen. Isolierte Aktivitätszellen wurden in Alpha Centauri, Aldebaran und Regulus niedergeschmettert. Unerklärlicherweise ist dazu die gesamte shivanische Aktivität in den Capella-Kolonien verschwunden.

Der Großteil der shivanischen Armada scheint sich nach Ikeya und Ross 128 zurückzuziehen, wo sie sehr wahrscheinlich Widerstand leisten wollen und möglicherweise einen Gegenangriff versuchen werden. Allerdings bezweifeln die GTA-Taktiker ihre Aussichten auf Erfolg. Experten haben beobachtet, dass den Shivanern eine geordnete Führung und Koordination zu fehlen scheinen."

3093, "$b Unsere $b Mission

Während der Rest der Flotte die Shivaner im terranischen und vasudanischen Raum jagt, wurden die Spezialoperationen mit der Aufweichung der fliehenden Armada beauftragt, während sie versuchen, sich neu zu gruppieren. Ihre nächsten Missionen werden gezielte Schläge gegen Übermachten tief im shivanischen Territorium sein. Glücklicherweise haben wir einige neue Werkzeuge, die uns dabei helfen."

3094, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTW-99 $b Shield $b Breaker

Der neue Shield Breaker, übersetzt Schildbrecher, ist eine speziell ausgegebene Waffe, die speziell für diesen Feldzug entwickelt wurde. Entwickelt als eine Anti-Shivaner Waffe, ist der Shield Breaker ein elektromagnetischer Energiestörer, welcher massiven Schaden an gegnerischen Verteidigungssystemen zufügt. Diese Waffe verursacht keine strukturellen Schäden, aber in Verbindung mit einer Anti-Hüllen-Kanone, wie die Prometheus, wird er sehr wirksam gegen stark abgeschirmte Jäger und Bomber. Der Shield Breaker hat größere Waffenkompatibilität und Energieeffizienz als die Banshee."

3095, "$b Neue $b Technologie: $b GTB $b Zeus

Forschung und Entwicklung hat die Feldtests des Zeus-Stoßbombers abgeschlossen. Wie die Athena, seiner Vorgängerin, bietet der Zeus hervorragende Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit. Darüber hinaus ermöglicht ein effizienterer Entwurf dem Zeus, Tsunamis zu tragen. Diese Eigenschaften machen den Zeus zu einer vielseitigen und wirksamen Waffe gegen mittelgroße Ziele."

3096, "Die jüngsten Siege haben den Großteil der $h shivanischen Flotte dazu gezwungen, sich in die Systeme zurückzuziehen, in denen sie ursprünglich aufgetaucht sind: $h Ikeya und $h Ross $h 128$| . Die Aufklärung hat mehrere Wellen an schwerbewachten shivanischen Konvois geortet, die von Ribos nach Ikeya fliegen.

Unsere Mission hier ist zweierlei. Zuerst werden wir die shivanischen Konvois ausschalten und ihre Versorgungslinien abschneiden. Als nächstes werden wir ihre Fracht kapern und deren Inhalt untersuchen."

3097, "Ihr Geschwader wird zwischen den Konvois in das System einfliegen. Sie müssen schnell alle shivanischen Jäger eliminieren, welche den Knoten bewachen. Sobald das Gebiet gesichert ist, werden unsere Streitkräfte einen Hinterhalt einrichten."

3098, "Wachgeschütze werden in der Nähe des Ikeya-Sprungknotens abgesetzt, um alle flüchtenden Schiffe abzufangen. Die Staffeln Alpha und Beta werden alle shivanischen Frachter und Transporter so zerstören, dass die Fracht einsatzfähig bleibt. Unsere eigenen Frachter werden dann die Fracht aufnehmen und abfliegen."

3099, "Wir schätzen, dass wir in der Lage sind, mindestens drei Wellen an Transportern abzufangen, bevor die Shivaner über unseren Plan alarmiert werden. Im Falle von unvorhergesehenen Entwicklungen, warten Sie auf Befehle von Command.

Melden Sie sich sofort auf dem Flugdeck!"

3100, "Sie haben einem bedeutenden Teil der shivanischen Streitmacht erlaubt, zu entkommen. Obwohl wir dabei erfolgreich waren, den Großteil der shivanischen Versorgungslinie zu neutralisieren, werden die überlebenden Schiffe zweifellos später Schwierigkeiten für unsere Streitkräfte verursachen. Ihr Versagen wird uns Leben und Schiffe kosten, die wir nicht hätten verlieren müssen."

3101, "Die Deaktivierung der Frachter wird sie daran hindern, zu entkommen. Alternativ kannst du Disruptor-Raketen verwenden, um ihre Systeme vorübergehend auszuschalten."

3102, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot! Ihre Leistung in dieser Mission war hervorragend. Die shivanischen Versorgungslinien nach Ikeya wurden abgeschnitten und wir haben jetzt die vollständige Kontrolle über diesen Subraumknoten."

3103, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot! Unsere Eindämmungsoperation war wirksam bei der Neutralisierung des Großteils der shivanischen Versorgungslinie. Die wenigen überlebenden Schiffe dürften die shivanische Position in Ikeya nicht wesentlich verstärken. Dennoch bildet sich der GTI selbst etwas darauf ein, über die Pflicht hinauszugehen und nicht alle Schiffe zerstört zu haben, wird unserem Ruf etwas schädigen."

3104, "Sie haben auch alle feindlichen Ziele zerstört, darunter mehrere Jägerstaffeln sowie den Cain-Kreuzer Maus. Sie und Ihre Staffelpiloten werden für diese Errungenschaft gelobt."

3105, "Leider wurde nicht die ganze Fracht geborgen. Einige unserer Bergungsschiffe wurden von den shivanischen Kreuzern zerstört. Mit den Shivanern, die im gesamten terranisch-vasudanischen Raum zerstört werden oder einfach spurlos verschwinden, müssen wir alle Daten über sie sammeln, solange wir noch die Gelegenheit dazu haben."

3106, "Wenn du einige der Türme der Kreuzer mit Phoenix- oder Stiletto-Raketen ausschalten kannst, sollten die Transporter in der Lage sein, sicher rauszuspringen."

3107, "Unglücklicherweise wurde nicht die gesamte Fracht geborgen. Die Theta-Staffel kam nie beim festgelegten GTI-Treffpunkt an. Das Oberkommando hat sie offiziell als VERMISST gemeldet, bis Beweise für das Gegenteil gefunden werden könnten, allerdings ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass sie von den Shivanern abgefangen wurden. Halten Sie Ihre Augen in der Zukunft nach ungewöhnlichen Aktivitäten offen."

3108, "Trotz der geringen Erfolgsaussichten sind sie geblieben und konfrontierten die zusätzlichen Kreuzer und unterstützten damit die Monitor und die Leto bei ihrer Verteidigung des Knotens.

3142, "Das ist richtig, Beta 2. Seien Sie geduldig. Laden Sie nach, falls nötig."

3143, "Also, wie gefallen Ihnen diese neuen Zeus-Bomber? Weit besser als die Athena, wenn du mich fragst. Und sie haben diesen Geruch eines neuen Jägers."

3144, "Du sagst es! Ich kann es kaum erwarten, ein paar Tsunamis in die Frachter zu bomben. Er lässt sich fast so gut wie der Herc fliegen, was ein Vorteil ist."

3160, "Der dritte Konvoi wurde zerstört! Gut gemacht, Piloten!"

3161, "Einer der Frachter hat den Sprung nach Ikeya gemacht."

3162, "Ein Transporter ist entkommen! Lassen Sie sich nicht von den Jägern ablenken, Alpha."

3163, "Eine shivanische Bomberstaffel hat den Sprung gemacht."

3164, "Die SC Maus ist nach Ikeya entkommen!"

3165, "Wir haben die SC Maus zerstört!"

3166, "Shivaner greifen unsere Bergungsschiffe an! Beschützen Sie sie, Piloten!"

3167, "Command, ich lese zwei Lilith-Kreuzer auf! Fordere Statusmeldung!"

3168, "Halten Sie sich bereit, Piloten. Verstärkungen werden eingesetzt, um den Knoten zu sichern. Greifen Sie die Kreuzer nach Ihrem eigenen Ermessen an."

3169, "GTC Monitor und GTC Leto sind jetzt auf Position. Die Delta-Bomber greifen die Kreuzer an. Alpha und Beta, Sie können zur Basis zurückkehren."

3170, "GTC Monitor ist jetzt auf Position. Die Delta-Bomber greifen die Kreuzer an. Alpha und Beta, Sie können zur Basis zurückkehren."

3171, "Delta-Staffel fliegt jetzt für den Abschuss rein. Decken Sie uns, Epsilon!"

3172, "Beide shivanischen Kreuzer sind eliminiert worden. Gut gemacht! Alpha, kehren Sie sofort für die Abschlussbesprechung zur Krios zurück."

3173, "Die shivanische Kreuzergruppe Hellfire ist auf ihrem Weg, die shivanische Hauptkampfgruppe zu verstärken. Die Aufgabe des Spielergeschwaders: Abfangen."

3174, "Die Aufklärung hat eine shivanische Kreuzergruppe beobachtet, die als $h Hellfire bezeichnet wird, die auf dem Weg zum $b Ikeya$| -Sprungknoten ist. Wenn $h Hellfire ihr Ziel erreicht, wäre sie wieder mit der shivanischen Hauptflotte vereint."

3175, "$h Hellfire besteht aus vier Kreuzern, sowohl Cain-, wie auch Lilith-Klasse, mit einer Jägereskorte von zehn bis fünfzehn Schiffen. Normalerweise würden wir die $f Krios schicken, um die Knotenblockade zu verstärken, allerdings wurde diese Information in letzter Minute erhalten, weshalb wir keine Zeit für einen vollständigen Einsatz haben."

3176, "Stattdessen wird Ihr Geschwader so viel wie möglich von der shivanischen Streitmacht abfangen und zerstören. Beta und Delta werden die Kreuzer angreifen. Alpha und Gamma werden die Bomber-Staffeln verteidigen und die Jägerbedrohung neutralisieren."

3177, "Wenn $h Hellfire aufgehalten wird, können wir einen entscheidenden Sieg in $b Ikeya erwarten. Wenn $h Hellfire durchkommt, können die Shivaner in der Lage sein, lange genug durchzuhalten, um eine Offensive zu starten.

Unsere Streitkräfte zählen auf Sie, Piloten! Melden Sie sich sofort auf dem Flugdeck!"

3178, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Die gesamte shivanische Kampfgruppe wurde, dank Ihres Geschwaders, zerstört. Sie haben Ihren Einsatz für den GTI ein weiteres Mal unter Beweis gestellt."

3179, "Sie haben es in dieser Mission gut gemacht, Pilot. Obwohl ein Kreuzer entkam, werden wir ihn zerstören, wenn wir unseren Angriff durchführen."

3180, "Wenn du Kreuzer deaktivierst, bevor sie entkommen, solltest du in der Lage sein, deine Ziele erfüllen zu können. Der Einsatz von Disruptor-Raketen und Stilettos kann zu großem Erfolg führen."

3181, "Sie haben auch die Jägereskorte von Hellfire zerstört. Dies wird unseren Angriff auf Ikeya für unsere Bomber viel einfacher machen."

3182, "Harr! Die FS2 Volition Bravos ist das gemeinste Schiff im bekannten Universum. Rolle deine Segel ein, gebe auf und bereite dich darauf vor, vom $quoteFreeSpace 2$quote-Team geentert zu werden!"

3183, "Glücklicherweise waren Sie in der Lage, die Hellfire Jägereskorte zu zerstören. Das wird uns ein bisschen helfen, das Ungleichgewicht auszugleichen."

3184, "Leider haben Sie es nicht geschafft, Hellfires Jägereskorte zu zerstören. Diese Schiffe werden zweifellos zurückkehren, um bei der bevorstehenden Invasion Schwierigkeiten für unsere Streitkräfte zu verursachen. Solche Unachtsamkeiten passen nicht zu einem GTI-Offizier. Dieser Vorfall wird in Ihrer Dienstakte vermerkt werden."

3185, "Diese Mission lief nicht so, wie geplant. Zwei shivanische Kreuzer haben es geschafft, die Flotte in Ikeya zu verstärken und Scans deuten darauf hin, dass sie jetzt die andere Seite des Sprungknotens blockieren. Sie haben jetzt eine überlegende Position erlangt und wir erwarten jetzt bei unserem ersten Vorstoß schwere Verluste."

3186, "Decke deine Bomber und sie werden an den Kreuzern arbeiten. Disruptor-Raketen können verwendet werden, um die Kreuzer vorübergehend auszuschalten, was wichtige Zeit verschafft. $quotePhoenix V$quote-Raketen sind ebenfalls sehr wirksam gegen die Türme."

3187, "Diese Mission war ein einziges Desaster! Wir hatten speziell für diese Operation vier Staffeln vorgesehen und es ist Ihnen gelungen, nur einen einzigen Kreuzer zu zerstören! Wir haben nicht die Mittel, um den Krieg mit den Shivanern viel länger zu führen und Fehlschläge wie diese kosten uns Schiffe, Waffen und Leben."

3188, "Ihre Leistung in dieser Mission war katastrophal. Obwohl Sie die Bedeutung der Mission erkannten, haben Sie es nicht geschafft einen einzigen Kreuzer zu zerstören. Diese Schande ist jetzt dauerhaft ein Fleck in Ihrer Dienstakte."

3189, "Allerdings sind wir so knapp an Piloten, dass wir es uns nicht leisten können, Ihnen Flugverbot zu erteilen. Stattdessen wird Ihr Geschwader ein Teil der ersten Angriffswelle auf die verstärkten shivanischen Positionen sein."

3190, "Die Beta- und Delta-Staffel tragen Tsunami-Bomben, um mit denen die Kreuzer zu zerstören. Du musst sie beschützen, indem du die Jägereskorte weglockst und, wenn möglich, die Türme angreifst."

3191, "Mit dem sicheren Ribos-System, ist der Weg für unsere Streitkräfte frei, um den Angriff auf Ikeya zu beginnen. Die Intrepid und die Hope sind nach Ribos eingesetzt worden, um diese Operation anzuführen. Aufklärer haben festgestellt, dass kein shivanisches Schiff, was größer als ein Kreuzer ist, in diesem Gebiet des Weltraums übriggeblieben ist, so sollte die Eroberung des Systems nur eine Angelegenheit von Tagen sein.

Mit unserem Sieg im Ikeya-System ist es verbündeten Streitkräften gelungen, die shivanische Anwesenheit in fast jeder Ecke des terranisch-vasudanischen Raumes auszurotten. Nur noch ein shivanischer Stützpunkt ist übriggeblieben: Das $quoteRoss 128$quote-System, Ort des ersten shivanischen Angriffes auf unser Territorium.

Die GTA und PVN haben alle verfügbaren Schiffe, zur Vorbereitung der Invasion auf Ross 128, nach Delta Serpentis eingesetzt. Der Angriff wird von der GTD Bastion und der PVD Pinnacle angeführt, den besten Schiffen der terranischen und vasudanischen Flotte."

3212, "$b In $b der $b Vorhut

Der Nachrichtendienst glaubt, dass die Shivaner genügend Versorgungsgüter und Kriegsschiffe in Ross 128 haben, um eine bedeutsame Verteidigung aufzubauen. Die Spezialoperationen wurden beauftragt das zu tun, was auch immer notwendig ist, um den Widerstand zu verringern, auf den unsere Flotten treffen werden, wenn sie das System durchstreifen.

Unsere Operationen werden in zwei Stufen unterteilt. In der ersten Stufe werden unsere Geschwader eine gewaltsame Aufklärung des Systems durchführen, um die beste alliierte Angriffsstrategie zu bestimmen. In der zweiten Stufe, nach dem Beginn der Invasion, werden unsere Geschwader strategische Angriffe gegen die wichtigsten shivanischen Positionen durchführen.

Wir werden alle verfügbaren Staffeln auf kontinuierliche Rotation setzen, wenn Sie also gehen, melden Sie sich umgehend bei Ihren Geschwaderführern für die Missionsbesprechungen. Die Krios selbst wird an einem versteckten Ort in Bereitschaft bleiben, falls während der Invasion Probleme auftreten sollten."

Um unsere Streitkräfte bei der Invasion zu unterstützen, hat Forschung und Entwicklung zwei neue Waffen zur Verfügung gestellt.

Als eine Variante der Synaptic, wurde dieser Gruppensprengkopf des GTI für Angriffe auf Gruppen oder Staffeln gegnerischer Schiffe entworfen. Beim Erreichen des Zieles zersplittert der primäre Sprengkopf in mehrere sekundäre Sprengköpfe, welche innerhalb von einer Sekunde explodieren. Die Detonationen erzeugen ein Feld an Energiestößen, was die Cluster Bomb, übersetzt Streubombe, damit höchst wirksam gegen Jägerformationen und Frachter macht.

Die Rakete ist dafür entworfen, um einen großen elektromagnetischen Puls zu erzeugen, der Sensoren, Kommunikation und Navigationssysteme stört und damit alle kleinen Schiffe, die innerhalb des Explosionsradius geraten sind, beeinträchtigt.

Wir erwarten in Kürze eine Lieferung der Raketen von der Repulse und rechnen damit, dass die Waffe zur Verwendung verfügbar sein wird, wenn Sie von Ihren nächsten Missionen zurückkehren."

3215, "In Vorbereitung auf den Hauptstoß der GTA nach Ross 128, wird unser Geschwader losgeschickt, um das Gebiet zu erkunden. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, einen vermuteten shivanischen Aktivitätsmittelpunkt in der Nähe der Stelle des ursprünglichen Angriffes auf Außenposten Riviera zu scannen. Weil unser Kommunikationsnetzwerk in Ross 128 mit den ersten shivanischen Angriffen zerstört wurde, werden Sie für die Dauer dieser Mission keinen Kontakt mit Command haben."

3216, "Sammeln Sie so viele Daten, wie Sie können. Wir wissen nicht, wie weit sich die shivanische Anwesenheit in diesem Sektor erstreckt, also seien Sie vorsichtig. Erwarten Sie, dem standardmäßigen Kontingent an Frachtern, Transportern und Jägern zu begegnen. Scannen Sie alle Kriegsschiffe in dem Gebiet, wie auch alle Trümmer, die Sie finden. Wenn Sie die Gelegenheit bekommen, scannen Sie in diesem Gebiet auch jede verfügbare Fracht."

3217, "Der GTI legt großen Wert auf diese Operation, Piloten. Es ist vorzuziehen lieber eine kleine Menge an Daten zu sammeln und sicher zurückzukehren anstatt zu viele Informationen zu sammeln und es nicht lebendig raus zu schaffen. Wir brauchen alles, was Sie uns geben können, egal wie unbedeutend es auch scheinen mag. Wegtreten!"

3218, "Sie haben es versäumt irgendwelche lohnenden Daten auf diesem Einsatz zu sammeln, Pilot. Ohne die Scans beider Kreuzer kann der GTI keine vernünftige Theorie über das, was während Ihrer Mission passiert ist, entwickeln. Die GTA wird nun einen strategischen Nachteil haben, wenn sie ihre Invasion beginnt. Wegtreten!"

3219, "Das Scannen beider Kreuzer ist nicht schwer. Befehle nur deinen Staffelpiloten dich zu beschützen und fliege schnell rein und wieder raus.

Den Transporter und die Fracht zu scannen ist ein wenig schwieriger. Scanne den Transporter sobald du ankommst, dann befehle deinen Staffelpiloten die Frachter zu zerstören, so dass du die Fracht in Ruhe scannen kannst. Scanne die Kreuzer als letztes -- sie fliegen nirgends hin."

3220, "Diese Mission war für uns beide eine Überraschung, Pilot. Dank Ihrer Scans konnten wir bestätigen, dass die Kreuzer, denen Sie begegnet sind, GTI-Schiffe waren, die ursprünglich als GTC Odin und GTC Thor registriert wurden. Offizielle Berichte zeigen jedoch, dass diese Kreuzer in zwei unterschiedlichen Einsätzen zu Beginn des großen Krieges zerstört wurden. Die Tatsache, dass sich diese Schiffe zur selben Zeit in einem hochempfindlichen Sektor im shivanisch kontrollierten Raum befanden wie Ihr Einsatz, ist mehr als nur ein wenig verdächtig. Wir können nur davon ausgehen, dass diese Operation von einem abtrünnigen Teil des GTI durchgeführt wurde."

3221, "Dank Ihres Scans des shivanischen Transporters, kann der Nachrichtendienst bald in der Lage sein, die Motivation und die Absicht dieser abtrünnigen Operation zu bestimmen. Wir bereiten bereits einen vorläufigen Bericht für das terranische Oberkommando vor. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!"

3222, "Dank Ihres Scans der shivanischen Fracht, kann der Nachrichtendienst bald in der Lage sein, die Motivation und die Absicht dieser abtrünnigen Operation zu bestimmen. Wir bereiten bereits einen vorläufigen Bericht für das terranische Oberkommando vor. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!"

3223, "Dank Ihres Scans des shivanischen Transporters und der Fracht, kann der Nachrichtendienst bald in der Lage sein, die Motivation und die Absicht dieser abtrünnigen Operation zu bestimmen. Wir bereiten bereits einen vorläufigen Bericht für das terranische Oberkommando vor. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!"

3224, "Wir starten eine Untersuchung über die Motivation und der Absicht der abtrünnigen Operation. Das terranische Oberkommando wurde benachrichtigt und wir werden Sie über unsere Fortschritte auf dem Laufenden halten. Wegtreten!"

3225, "Das Scannen des Transporters oder der Fracht kann dem GTI eine bessere Vorstellung davon geben, was die Einsatzgruppe hier gemacht hat."

3234, "Wo sind die Shivaner? Dieses System sollte von ihnen wimmeln!"

3235, "Was tut diese Einsatzgruppe hier? Ist das eine Bergungsoperation?"

3236, "Terranische Schiffe, hier ist Beta 1 der 91. Phantoms von der GTD Krios. Bitte identifizieren Sie sich!"

3237, "Willkommen in Ross 128, meine Damen und Herren. Ich fürchte, dass Sie zu einer ziemlich unangemessenen Zeit gekommen sind. Bitte entschuldigen Sie."

3238, "An alle Jäger, erledigen Sie die Eindringlinge!"

3239, "Eindringlinge? Was zur Hölle ist hier los?"

3240, "Ausweichmanöver! Wer auch immer sie sind, sie sind offensichtlich nicht auf unserer Seite. Lassen Sie uns unsere Mission beenden und hier rausfliegen."

3241, "Alpha 1, scannen Sie alles, was sie können. Wir werden Sie decken."

3242, "Wir haben die Kreuzer gescannt! Sobald wir nach Hause kommen, werden wir herausfinden, was hier los ist."

3243, "Der letzte Auftritt"

3244, "Mit einer kleinen Hilfe von der EMP-Rakete beißt der letzte shivanische Demon ins Gras. Aber etwas stimmt nicht ..."

3245, "Verbündete Streitkräfte im gesamten System haben über große Siege in ihren Angriffen gegen die Shivaner berichtet. Die $f GTD $f Bastion und ihre Kampfgruppe haben bereits zahlreiche Kreuzer, Jägerstaffeln und Frachtdepots zerstört. Die $f PVD $f Pinnacle und ihre Kampfgruppe hat ähnliche Erfolge gemeldet.

Aber um Ross 128 endgültig zu sichern, müssen wir die shivanische Infrastruktur enthaupten. Der Nachrichtendienst glaubt, dass die Kommandoquelle der Shivaner in diesem System die $h SD $h Archon ist, einem Zerstörer der Demon-Klasse. Dieses Schiff wird das Ziel unserer nächsten Operation sein."

3246, "Die $h Archon ist ein Ort großer shivanischer Aktivität, wo die Aufklärung mehrere Frachter, Transporter, Frachtformationen und Wachgeschütze, sowie mindestens zwei Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse gesichtet hat: Die $h SC $h Golem und die $h SC $h Chimera.

Sie werden eine GTI-Einsatzgruppe in das Gebiet anführen und alle Schiffe eliminieren, denen Sie begegnen. Normalerweise wären Sie in einer solchen Operation deutlich unterlegen, aber wir haben was Besonderes auf Lager."

3247, "Die neue $b EMP-Rakete wurde fertiggestellt und diese Mission wird als abschließende Bewertung dienen. Die Staffeln $f Iota und $f Kappa der $b 122. $b Crazy $b Ivans$| , überwacht von der $f GTSC $f Giordano$| , werden die Gegend vor Ihrem Einsatz mit elektromagnetischen Impulsen sättigen."

3248, "Die EMP-Wolke wird alle Sensoren auf terranischen und shivanischen Schiffen beeinträchtigen. Die Shivaner sollten nicht in der Lage sein, Sie erfassen zu können, allerdings können Sie sie ebenfalls nicht erfassen. Aus diesem Grund sollte Ihre Bestückung ungelenkte und hitzesuchende Raketen beinhalten. Unsere Wissenschaftler haben vorausgesagt, dass dieser Effekt zwischen zwei und fünf Minuten anhalten wird."

3249, "Die Staffeln $f Alpha$| , $f Beta und $f Gamma werden die $b 122. ablösen und so viel Schaden wie möglich verursachen, solange das EMP-Feld aktiv ist. Sobald der Effekt abnimmt und Aspektaufschaltung möglich ist, werden die Staffeln $f Delta und $f Epsilon mit ihren schweren Waffen eingesetzt. Das Oberkommando hat die Verwendung der schweren $quote$f GTB $f Ursa$| $quote-Bombern für diese Mission genehmigt."

3250, "Das ist der Gnadenstoß, Piloten! Sobald die $h Archon zerstört worden ist, sollte die alliierte Flotte keine Schwierigkeiten haben, die Überreste der shivanischen Flotte zu isolieren und zu eliminieren. Wenn Sie hier heute Erfolg haben, haben wir nichts mehr zu befürchten. Viel Glück!"

3308, "Hier ist General Tess der GTD Soyakaze.

Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, was Sie denken müssen, Piloten. Sie kehren nach etwas, was ein großer Sieg hätte sein sollen, zu Ihrem Kommandoschiff zurück, nur um es unter Beschuss durch Ihre Kameraden vorzufinden. Obwohl Sie tapfer gekämpft haben, war die Krios und ihre Besatzung bereits verloren. Sie starben einen bitteren Tod, verraten von der Organisation, der sie geschworen hatten zu verteidigen.

Diese Entwicklung hat gravierende Auswirkungen auf die Zukunft der terranisch-vasudanischen Allianz. Das terranische Oberkommando wurde bereits über unsere Situation informiert und wird auf dem neusten Stand gebracht, während wir die Überlebenden der Krios befragen. Ich werde mich morgen mit unseren Erkenntnissen an die Besatzung der Soyakaze wenden.

In Anerkennung Ihres Beitrags zum alliierten Sieg über die Shivaner hat Ihnen die GTA die Ehrenmedaille verliehen. Sehen Sie einen Trost in der Tatsache, dass, obwohl Ihre Rückkehr nicht so triumphierend ist, wie sie sein sollte, wir die Shivaner nie wieder fürchten müssen."

3309, "Es gab nichts, was du hättest tun können, um die Krios zu retten."

Diese Entwicklung hat gravierende Auswirkungen auf die Zukunft der terranisch-vasudanischen Allianz. Wenn eine abtrünnige Zelle in unserem Militär aktiv ist, hat sie das Potenzial unsere Wiederaufbaubemühungen deutlich zu destabilisieren. Das terranische Oberkommando hat eine vollständige Untersuchung angefordert, aber ohne die Besatzung oder den Flugaufzeichnungen der Krios befürchte ich, dass wir nur wenig Anhaltspunkte haben."

$b Sieg

Heute Morgen um 05:25 Uhr erklärte das GTA-Oberkommando einen entscheidenden Sieg über die Shivaner in Ross 128 und Ikeya. Die Spezies, die die Alten vernichtete, die Vasuda Prime verwüstete und der es fast gelang, die Menschheit an den Rand der Auslöschung zu treiben, wurde besiegt. Aufklärungseinheiten haben keine Spur von verbliebenen shivanischen Aktivitäten gefunden.

Da die Shivaner jetzt fort sind, sollten wir in der Lage sein, unsere erschütterten Systeme wiederaufzubauen und an einer dauerhaften Allianz mit den Vasudanern zu arbeiten. Allerdings gab es eine schreckliche neue Entwicklung."

3346, "$b Hinterhalt

Während verbündete Streitkräfte in ganz Ross 128 die Shivaner angegriffen haben, haben Jäger und Bomber, die von der GTD Repulse gestartet sind, heimlich die Krios angegriffen, deaktiviert und zerstört. Nur dank des Eingreifens der Soyakaze konnten die Überlebenenden gerettet werden. Wir glauben, dass die Krios zerstört wurde, um Informationen zu vertuschen, die sie über die abtrünnigen Aktivitäten des $quoteForschung und Entwicklung$quote-Zweigs des GTI gesammelt hatte.

Nachdem wir mit dem GTA-Oberkommando in Verbindung getreten waren, trat die Repulse und die F&E-Flotte sofort in Aktion und zog sich aus Ross 128 in Richtung Delta Serpentis zurück. Das Oberkommando hat allen GTA-Einheiten dazu ermächtigt, diese Streitkräfte als feindlich zu betrachten und sie bei jeder Gelegenheit zu kapern oder zu zerstören.

Unsere Agenten haben die Ereignisse zusammengesetzt, die zur Zerstörung der Krios führten, indem sie die Beweise untersuchten, die von ihr geborgen werden konnten. Es folgt eine Zusammenfassung dieses Berichtes."

3347, "$b Beweise

Die von der Krios durchgeführten Vernehmungen der Einstein-Überlebenden deuten darauf hin, dass Forschung und Entwicklung bereits von der Existenz der Shivaner wusste, bevor sie erstmals in Ross 128 auftauchten. Mehrere Wissenschaftsschiffe, darunter auch die Einstein, wurden beauftragt, diese neue Spezies und ihre Technologie im geheimen zu studieren. Wir glauben, dass die Einstein in Ross 128 eingesetzt und dann als zerstört gemeldet wurde, damit das Schiff seine Forschungsoperation fortsetzen konnte, ohne sich vor einer externen Überwachung zu fürchten.

Während F&E dazu beitrug, dass die GTA- und PVN-Flotten die technologische Lücke zu den Shivanern während des großen Krieges schnell schließen konnten, deuten die Ereignisse stark darauf hin, dass die Repulse und ihre Flotte die bedeutendsten Entwicklungen für sich behalten haben. Aufgrund des Erscheinens der Einstein beim vasudanischen Forschungsstandort in Deneb hat General Scott die Theorie aufgestellt, dass es eine unbekannte Anzahl an F&E-Geisterschiffen geben könnte, die Forschungen durchführen, für die die GTA nicht verantwortlich ist. Diese Theorie wurde bestärkt, als Piloten der Krios in Ross 128 in eine geheime Bergungsoperation platzen und durch abtrünnige Schiffe unter Beschuss gerieten."

3348, "$b Verrat

Mit der Krios, die langsam die Beweise zusammenstellte, wuchs die Gefahr für den abtrünnigen Teil aufzufliegen. Die Repulse wollte diese Informationen zerstören, bevor sie eine kritische Menge erreichte und fand dafür auch bald die perfekte Gelegenheit.

Da die Jägerstaffeln und Unterstützungsschiffe der Krios die Shivaner in Ross 128 angriffen, wurde der Zerstörer praktisch ohne Verteidigung zurückgelassen. Die Rebellen starteten Bomber gegen die Krios, während sie mehrere Missionen der Spezialoperationen säuberten und die Übertragungen von anderen, unter dem Deckmantel der Überwachung von wissenschaftlichen Daten, störten. Nur die Piloten, die die SD Archon angriffen, kehrten früh genug zurück, um Zeuge der Zerstörung der Krios zu werden und nur aufgrund ihrer schnellen Reaktion konnten wir genügend Beweise bergen um Forschung und Entwicklung zu belasten. Wir haben uns darum bemüht, diese Informationen so weit zu verbreiten, dass sie nicht mehr verdeckt werden können. Die stille Bedrohung wurde ins Freie gezwungen."

3349, "$b Rebellion

Wir kennen weder das volle Ausmaß des Aufstandes, noch die Motive oder Ziele der Rebellen. Bedauerlicherweise haben unsere Manöver gegen die Shivaner unsere Flotten einer ernsthaften Gefahr für Guerillaangriffen aus dem Inneren heraus ausgesetzt. Während die GTA ihre Streitkräfte zusammenlegt, wurde die Soyakaze damit beauftragt, alle Daten über die Ziele des Feindes zu sammeln, die wir finden können. Wir dürfen nicht zulassen, dass sie das Element der Überraschung auf ihrer Seite haben.

Melden Sie sich sofort bei den Missionseinsatzbesprechungen."

3350, "Rühren, Piloten und willkommen bei den 82. Nighthawks. Ich verstehe, dass Sie von der Zerstörung der $f Krios immer noch ein bisschen erschüttert sind, aber seien Sie versichert -- die $h F&E$| -Rebellen werden früher oder später das bekommen, was sie verdient haben. Das $f terranische $f Oberkommando und die Offiziere der $f Soyakaze untersuchen noch immer die Daten bezüglich des $h F&E$| -Aufstandes und bereiten einen Gegenangriff vor. Wenn die Zeit gekommen ist, werden Sie vollständig darüber informiert."

3351, "Momentan entwickelt sich gerade eine Situation in $b Delta $b Serpentis$| . Hinter unserer Rückwärtigen Verteidigung schlüpfend, startete die $h Repulse einen Überraschungsangriff gegen die diplomatischen Installationsanlagen im Orbit von Delta Serpentis IV. Die $f terranischen und $f vasudanischen Streitkräfte reagierten zwar schnell, als sie aber ankamen, war die Orbitalanlage der vasudanischen Botschaft bereits ausgelöscht worden.

Die Opferzahlen waren geringer, als man von einem solchen Angriff erwarten würde, aber unsere Kommunikation mit der vasudanischen Regierung befindet sich in der Auflösung. Es ist unnötig zu sagen, dass der Vorfall die terranisch-vasudanischen Beziehungen nicht verbessert hat."

3352, "Obwohl sich die $h Repulse inzwischen versteckt hat, geht die GTA keinerlei Risiko ein. Die Überlebenden des Angriffes werden derzeit in befestigte Positionen innerhalb der terranisch-vasudanischen Flotte verlegt. Diplomaten, Offiziere und Versorgungskonvois sind derzeit auf dem Weg zu einem sicheren Treffpunkt im $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-System, wo sie dann von der $f GTC $f Challenger und der $f PVC $f Bastet ergänzt werden."

3353, "Leider hat $h F&E Zugriff zu unserem Flottenkommunikationsnetzwerk, weshalb es sehr wahrscheinlich ist, dass die Konvois unter Beschuss geraten werden. Sie müssen die Konvois verteidigen, bis die Challenger und Bastet ankommen. Sobald die Kreuzer Sie abgelöst haben, können Sie zur $f Soyakaze zurückkehren.

Versagen Sie nicht, Piloten. Wegtreten!"

3354, "Ihr Hauptziel war es, den Konvoi gegen einen Rebellenangriff zu verteidigen und Sie haben dabei versagt! Hunderte an unschuldigen Leben gingen aufgrund Ihrer Unfähigkeit verloren. Schlimmer noch sind die terranischen Beziehungen zur vasudanischen Regierung möglicherweise irreparabel beschädigt worden.

Sie und Ihre Staffel erhalten bis zu einer formellen Untersuchung dieser Ereignisse Flugverbot. Als Staffelleiter werden Sie darüber hinaus vor ein Militärgericht gestellt und wegen vorsätzlicher Pflichtvernachlässigung angeklagt. Ehrlich gesagt, Sie werden Glück haben, wenn Sie nur eine unehrenhafte Entlassung bekommen."

3355, "Achte besonders auf die Staffeln Bragi, Roskva und Buri. Achte darauf, dass du nicht zu sehr von Nahkämpfen abgelenkt wirst."

3356, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha! Dank Ihnen wurde die Mehrheit der Überlebenden erfolgreich evakuiert. Sie wurden unter verbündeten Schutz gestellt und die GTA arbeitet jetzt daran, die geordnete Kommunikation mit der vasudanischen Regierung wiederherzustellen."

3357, "Ihr Frachterschutz sorgte dafür, dass die Flüchtlinge gut versorgt waren, als sie in ihrem Unterschlupf ankamen. Gut gemacht!"

3358, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Alpha! Durch Ihre Bemühungen hat es jedes Schiff unter Ihrer Obhut zu einem sicheren Hafen in Delta Serpentis geschafft. Sie wurden unter verbündeten Schutz gestellt und die GTA arbeitet jetzt daran, die geordnete Kommunikation mit der vasudanischen Regierung wiederherzustellen."

3359, "Alpha 4 zeigte ein Verhalten, was einem Offizier der GTA nicht würdig ist und wurde entsprechend diszipliniert. Lassen Sie mich daran erinnern, dass alle Piloten die Verantwortung dafür tragen die höchsten Verhaltensstands einzuhalten, ganz besonders im Umgang mit den Vasudanern.

Mit der Umpositionierung der GTA- und PVN-Flotten in Delta Serpentis ist der Weg für unsere Streitkräfte frei, einen Gegenangriff zu beginnen. Die nächste Einsatzbesprechung wird heute Nachmittag um 14:00 Uhr stattfinden. Seien Sie nicht zu spät!"

3372, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha! Zurück zur Basis."

3373, "Die Frachter wurden abgeschossen! Bleiben Sie beim Konvoi, Piloten! Lassen Sie nicht zu, dass die Jäger Sie ablenken."

3375, "Sie sind spät, Terraner. Unsere Schiffe haben sich bereits versammelt."

3376, "Spät? Wir sind gestartet, als wir unsere Befehle erhalten haben."

3377, "Wir haben erwartet, dass Sie bei unserer Ankunft hier sind. Während unseres Treffens waren wir für gegnerische Angriffe anfällig."

3378, "Hey, Freund, geben Sie uns eine Chance. Wir wissen weniger darüber als Sie. Wir sind so schnell wie möglich hierhergekommen."

3379, "Dann seien wir froh, dass die Rebellen nicht schneller waren."

3380, "Ich denke, wir haben sie alle. Alpha-Staffel, setzen Eskortformation fort."

3381, "Ich verstehe nicht, warum wir auch die vasudanischen Schiffe bewachen müssen. Haben sie keine eigenen Jäger?"

3382, "Der Großteil der Flotte wurde vom F&E-Angriff unvorbereitet überrascht. Ich bin mir sicher, dass die vasudanischen Jäger etwas Wichtiges zu tun haben."

3383, "Ja, zum Beispiel uns ausspionieren. Wenn du mich fragst, hätten wir sie niemals in Delta Serpentis lassen dürfen."

3384, "Ich habe Sie nicht gefragt und jetzt halten Sie den Mund. Sie können Sie hören."

3385, "Es ist mir egal, ob sie mich hören können. Sie können nichts von selbst, deshalb sind sie zu uns gerannt, als die Shivaner angegriffen haben. Deshalb brauchen sie uns, um jeden einzelnen ihrer beschissenen Konvois zu bewachen!"

3386, "Sie haben einen vorlauten Mund, Terraner. Wenn Sie die Wahrheit wüssten, würden Sie solche Dinge nicht sagen."

3387, "Ich werde sagen, was immer ich will, Fischliebhaber. Wenn wir nicht gewesen wären, hätten Sie keine Flotte, zu der Sie nach Hause laufen könnten. Sie konnten nicht einmal die Lucifer davon abhalten Ihren Planeten zu verwüsten!"

3388, "Pilot, das ist genug! Ihr Verhalten riskiert einen Speziesübergreifenden Vorfall! Konzentrieren Sie sich auf Ihre Mission und halten Sie Funkstille!"

3389, "Zum Handeln gezwungen"

3390, "Die GTA führt einen Überraschungsangriff auf eine geheime Schiffswerft im $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-System durch."

3391, "Der $quote$h Forschung $h und $h Entwicklung$| $quote-Zweig des GTI veranstaltet nun eine offene Rebellion gegen die $f GTA$| . Das terranische Oberkommando berichtet, dass sich alle $h F&E$| -Schiffe aus alliierten Operationen zurückziehen und sich in $b Delta $b Serpentis und $b Beta $b Aquilae neu gruppieren.

Wir vermuten, dass die Rebellen in diesen Systemen Sammelpunkte errichten, allerdings haben sie sich als sehr geschickt erwiesen, um unsere Bemühungen sie aufzuspüren, zu umgehen."

3392, "Zu unserem Glück beschäftigt der $f Nachrichtendienst$| -Zweig des GTI die erfahrensten Aufklärungs- und Spionageagenten in der gesamten GTA. Aufklärer der $f Soyakaze haben einen Hauptsammelpunkt in einer entlegenen Ecke von $b Delta $b Serpentis entdeckt, welcher von nichts Geringerem als der $h Repulse selbst bewacht wird.

Das Oberkommando hat uns befohlen die Repulse zu kapern, um das volle Ausmaß des Aufstandes bestimmen zu können. Die Operation wird wie folgt ausgeführt:"

3393, "Eine kleine Angriffsstreitmacht wird losgeschickt, um die $h Repulse direkt zu konfrontieren und um ihre Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. In der Zwischenzeit wird die $f Alpha$| -Staffel auf der anderen Seite der Einsatzzone ankommen und versuchen unentdeckt reinzuschlüpfen. Die Angriffsstreitmacht wird versuchen, die Repulse lange genug abzulenken, damit Sie sie deaktivieren und entwaffnen können. Transporter werden dann ankommen, um das Schiff zu entern und einzunehmen."

3394, "Neben der $h Repulse berichtet die Aufklärung auch über mehrere Frachter, drei Kreuzer und ein großes Trockendock unbekannter Konfiguration. Das Trockendock ist unbewaffnet und sollte keine Bedrohung darstellen, aber die anderen Schiffe müssen zerstört werden. Zusätzliche Einheiten werden eingesetzt, um diese Bedrohungen zu neutralisieren, aber Sie müssen ihnen möglicherweise helfen, wenn Sie Ihre Ziele erreicht haben. Vasudanische Streitkräfte blockieren die Sprungknoten nach $b Beta $b Aquilae und $b Ross $b 128$| , um zu verhindern, dass Schiffe entkommen."

3395, "Gehen Sie bei dieser Mission vorsichtig vor, Piloten! Die $h Repulse wird von $h General $h Marcus $h Glaive$| , dem ranghöchsten Feldoffizier von $h F&E$| , befehligt. Sie können sicher sein, dass er seine fähigsten Streitkräfte, einschließlich seiner Tarnjäger der $h Loki$| -Klasse einsetzen wird, um seine Position zu verteidigen.

Obwohl unsere Ingenieure nach einer Schwäche in der Tarntechnologie der Loki suchen, haben sich ihre Bemühungen bisher als nicht erfolgreich erwiesen. Unabhängig der Situation müssen Sie alles in Ihrer Machtstehende tun, um sicherzustellen, dass diese Mission erfolgreich ist. Die Sicherheit der gesamten GTA kann davon abhängen."

3396, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Unsere Streitkräfte haben eine totale Säuberung des Kampfgebietes durchgeführt. Trotz heftigem Widerstand gelang es uns, die Repulse zu kapern und ihre Kreuzereskorte zu zerstören. Die Vasudaner berichten, dass alle Schiffe, die versuchten dem System zu entkommen, durch die Blockaden neutralisiert wurden.

Bedauerlicherweise konnten wir General Glaive selbst nicht gefangen nehmen. Während Sie vom Transporter Omega abgelenkt wurden, startete eine einzige Hermes-Fluchtkapsel aus dem Hangar der Repulse und sprang zu einem unbekannten Ort. Versuche, die Kapsel zu verfolgen, haben sich bisher als nicht erfolgreich erwiesen. Der Nachrichtendienst glaubt jedoch, dass die Befragung der Mannschaft der Repulse uns ausreichende Informationen liefern wird, um unseren nächsten Schritt zu planen."

3397, "Gegenwärtig sind wir der Überzeugung, dass die Repulse sich nicht an einem Sammelpunkt treffen wollte, wie wir ursprünglich angenommen hatten, sondern eine Werft während der Evakuierung bewachte. Frachter haben für mehrere Tage Versorgungsgüter aus diesem Gebiet gebracht und das Trockendock wurde für die Selbstzerstörung vorbereitet.

Das Trockendock selbst ist so etwas wie ein Rätsel. Obwohl es aus standardmäßigen Polarismodulen besteht, existieren keine Entwürfe für eine Konfiguration dieser Größe und Ausmaß. Scans zeigen, dass das Trockendock vor kurzem noch von einem großen Schiff belegt wurde, aber alle Wartungs- und Reparaturaufzeichnungen wurden gelöscht.

Was das an dieser Stelle genau bedeutet, ist unklar, aber das Oberkommando hat uns aufgefordert, unsere Untersuchung vorsichtig fortzusetzen."

3398, "Sie und Ihr Geschwader haben die Repulse zerstört, trotz der spezifischen Befehle, sie zur Kaperung zu bewahren.

Dieser Fehlschlag hat uns unsere beste Gelegenheit gekostet, die Stärke, das Ausmaß und den Zweck der Rebellion in Erfahrung zu bringen. Obwohl wir die Führung der Rebellen beseitigt haben, werden Guerillastreitkräfte nach wie vor unsere Schiffe belästigen und unsere Konvois in Delta Serpentis und Beta Aquilae angreifen. Diese Streitkräfte aufzuspüren wird uns Zeit, militärische Stärke und Leben kosten, die wir uns hätten sparen können, wenn unsere Operation erfolgreich gewesen wäre.

Ihr Geschwader wird bis auf weiteres aus dem aktiven Dienst gestrichen. Wegtreten!"

3399, "Zerstöre nicht die Repulse! Verwende Stilettos anstatt Tsunamis und passe auf deine Staffelpiloten auf."

3400, "Sie und Ihr Geschwader konnten die Repulse nicht deaktivieren, bevor sie entkam."

3401, "Sie und Ihr Geschwader konnten Omega nicht abfangen, bevor sie die Repulse reparieren konnte."

3402, "Dieser Fehlschlag hat uns unsere beste Gelegenheit gekostet, die Stärke, das Ausmaß und den Zweck der Rebellion in Erfahrung zu bringen. Wir werden die Operation ein zweites Mal versuchen müssen, aber die Repulse ist sich jetzt unserer Pläne voll bewusst und wird zweifellos Verstärkungen anfordern. Wir haben keine andere Wahl, als einen direkten Frontalangriff zu versuchen, der uns Zeit, militärische Stärke und Leben kosten wird, die wir uns hätten sparen können, wenn diese Operation direkt beim ersten Mal erfolgreich gewesen wäre.

Ihr Geschwader wird bis auf weiteres aus dem aktiven Dienst gestrichen. Wegtreten!"

3403, "Lasse nicht zu, dass die Repulse entkommt. Befolge deinen Befehlen und verwende deine Staffelpiloten mit Bedacht."

3404, "General Glaive"

3409, "Alpha, bleiben Sie auf Ihrer gegenwärtigen Position. Greifen Sie nicht an, bis Sie den Befehl dazu erhalten."

3410, "General Glaive, Sie und Ihre Flotte sind wegen des Verbrechens des Hochverrats gegen die Galaktisch Terranische Allianz angeklagt worden. Geben Sie Ihre Schiffe auf oder Sie werden zerstört!"

3411, "Sie sind wohl kaum in der Position Forderungen zu stellen, Oberst. Erwarten Sie wirklich, dass wir wegen zwei Kreuzern nachgeben?"

3412, "Es sind mehr Verstärkungen auf dem Weg, General! Sie können sich die Schwierigkeiten ersparen, indem Sie jetzt Ihre Schiffe herunterfahren."

3413, "Oberst, seien Sie vernünftig. Die Flotte wurde ausgelöscht und wir haben jeglichen Kontakt zur Erde verloren. Kampfhandlungen gegen uns sind zwecklos."

3414, "Geben Sie auf oder Sie werden zerstört. Das ist Ihre letzte Warnung!"

3415, "Ich habe keine Zeit dafür. An alle Jäger, greifen Sie die alliierten Kriegsschiffe an und zerstören Sie sie."

3416, "Die Lokis brechen aus, um die Kreuzer anzugreifen. Jetzt ist Ihre Gelegenheit, Alpha! Deaktivieren Sie die Repulse, bevor sie Sie bemerkt."

3417, "Die Lokis haben Ihre Anwesenheit bemerkt! Die Repulse lädt ihr Subraumantrieb auf -- Piloten, gehen Sie auf HÖCHSTGESCHWINDIGKEIT und schalten Sie ihre Antriebe aus, bevor sie springen kann!"

3418, "Die Repulse hat Ihre Anwesenheit bemerkt! Piloten, Sie haben sechzig Sekunden, um ihre Antriebe zu deaktivieren, bevor sie rausspringen kann. Los!"

3419, "Fliegen jetzt ab! Alle Schiffe, treffen Sie uns bei den Treffpunktkoordinaten. Repulse Ende."

3420, "Springen jetzt raus. Viel Glück, Piloten!"

3421, "Wir fliegen jetzt ab. Viel Glück, Piloten!"

3422, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha! Setzen jetzt die Staffeln Delta und Epsilon ein."

3423, "Die Repulse wurde entwaffnet. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Unser Transporter wird jeden Moment reinspringen. Halten Sie das Gebiet vor feindlichen Jägern sicher."

3424, "Die Repulse wurde entwaffnet. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Wir werden unseren Transporter reinschicken, wenn die verbliebenen Kreuzer neutralisiert worden sind."

3425, "Erster Kreuzer wurde abgeschossen."

3426, "Zweiter Kreuzer wurde abgeschossen."

3427, "Alle drei gegnerischen Kreuzer wurden abgeschossen."

3430, "Hier Lambda 1. Initiieren die Andockannäherung für die Repulse."

3431, "Hier ist Lambda 2. Initiieren jetzt die Andockannäherung."

3432, "Ein Rebellentransporter mit Eskorte ist reingesprungen! Sie greifen Lambda 1 an!"

3433, "Piloten, lassen Sie diesen Transporter nicht an der Repulse andocken!"

3434, "Lambda 1 wurde abgeschossen!"

3435, "Piloten, wir setzen einen zweiten Transporter ein. Räumen Sie diese gegnerischen Jäger so schnell wie möglich weg!"

3436, "Omega hat angedockt!"

3437, "Wir haben den Andockpunkt gesichert, Command. Entern jetzt die Repulse!"

3438, "Bericht von Trupp 1. Das Überschreiben der Hilfssysteme war erfolgreich. Alle Turbolifte wurden verriegelt. Wir sind jetzt auf dem Weg zum Flugdeck."

3439, "Command, wir haben die Kontrolle über den Hangar übernommen. Warten auf weitere Befehle."

3440, "Bestätigt. Setzen jetzt die Staffeln Sigma und Tau ein."

3441, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Unsere Marines können das von hier aus übernehmen. Zurück zur Basis."

3442, "Die Repulse ist entkommen!"

3443, "Die Repulse wurde zerstört!"

3444, "Alle Schiffe, kehren Sie zur Basis zurück! Wir müssen eine andere Strategie entwickeln."

3445, "Hier Zeta-Staffel. Wir entwaffnen die Repulse."

3446, "GTC Lone Wolf jetzt auf Position. Nehmen Verteidigungsposition ein."

3447, "Alpha 1, Sie haben alle Ihre Staffelpiloten verloren. Fordern Sie die Zeta-Staffel an, falls Sie Unterstützung benötigen."

3451, "Die Übertragung kam kaum durch, aber da draußen sieht es aus, wie in der Hölle. Bringen Sie das Chaos in Ordnung, finden Sie heraus, was passiert ist und halten Sie die Linie. Weitere Befehle werden Ihnen vor Ort ausgegeben."

3452, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Trotz heftigem Widerstand konnten Sie die Hope lange genug beschützen, bis wir sie zu einem sicheren Ort bringen konnten. Es wird lange dauern, bis der Zerstörer wieder einsatzbereit ist, aber Ihre Bemühungen haben Tausende an Leben und einen bedeutenden Teil unseres Kriegsmaterials gerettet.

Wir haben keine endgültigen Daten bezüglich des, in diesem Einsatz, verwendeten Serkr-Sprengkopfes. Dieser scheint zwischen 25 bis 50 Prozent stärker zu sein, als die Tsunami. Ihre Bemühungen haben verhindert, dass F&E diese Waffe in vollem Umfang verwenden konnte."

3453, "Sie haben auch jedes gegnerische Schiff neutralisiert, das versuchte, die Blockade zu durchbrechen. Das ist höchst beeindruckend! Dies wird die Rebellenoperationen in Beta Aquilae erheblich behindern."

3454, "Leider gelang es vielen Rebellenschiffen, unsere Blockade zu durchbrechen und ins $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-System zu flüchten. Unsere Bemühungen, sie durch den Subraum zu verfolgen, haben sich als unwirksam erwiesen."

3455, "Die Überlebenden, die aus den Aten-Kreuzern gerettet wurden, scheinen unter einem schweren Schock und an posttraumatischem Stress zu leiden und werden derzeit einer psychiatrischen Untersuchung unterzogen. Sie können sich glücklich schätzen, am Leben zu sein und die PVN hat für ihre sichere Rettung ihre Dankbarkeit ausgedrückt."

3456, "Viele der Überlebenden an Bord der Aten-Kreuzer wurden getötet, bevor sie sicher gerettet werden konnten. Ihr Verlust wird deutlich zu spüren sein."

3457, "Beschütze die Aten-Kreuzer bis die Überlebenden exfiltriert werden können."

3458, "Die Scans der GTSC Hinton sind sehr alarmierend. Es scheint, dass der Schaden, der der Blockade zugefügt wurde, durch shivanische Flusskanonen verursacht wurde, ähnlich zu denen, die auf dem Lucifer-Superzerstörer beobachtet wurden. Unsere Wissenschaftler grübeln noch über diese Daten und die Besatzung der Repulse wird über diese Angelegenheit verhört. Weitere Informationen zu diesem Verfahren wurden als geheim eingestuft, daher gehe ich davon aus, dass wir nur darüber informiert werden, was wir unbedingt wissen müssen."

3459, "Die PVD Hope und ihre Besatzung von über 9000 Offizieren und Besatzungsmitgliedern ging in der heftigen Rebellenoffensive verloren. Diese Tragödie ist ein schrecklicher Rückschlag für die Allianz. Nach dem Krieg mit den Shivanern und dem Aufkommen der F&E-Rebellion, ist der Verlust eines weiteren Zerstörers und die Mittel, die dieser bot, eine enorme Belastung für unsere verbliebenen Flotten. 

Der Verlust der Hope und die fast vollständige Zerstörung einer ganzen vasudanischen Blockade zeigt, dass die Rebellion viel mächtiger ist, als wir ursprünglich angenommen hatten. Das Oberkommando hat die terranischen Flotten aufgefordert, sich in Delta Serpentis zurückzuziehen, wo wir versuchen werden, unsere Streitkräfte zusammenzulegen."

3460, "Jage den Medusa-Bombern nach, die die Hope erfassen. Mache das, was Command sagt und priorisiere die Serkrs."

3495, "Das ist unmöglich, Pilot! Die Shivaner sind besiegt worden!"

3496, "Ich weiß nicht, Command, aber ich habe ein ganz schlechtes Gefühl dabei. Das sieht nicht wie Laser- oder Sprengkopfschaden aus, den ich je gesehen hätte."

3497, "Das rechtfertigt weitere Untersuchungen. Wir bereiten die GTSC Hinton für die Neueinsetzung bei Ihren Koordinaten vor. Sie wird einen tieferen Gebietsscan durchführen und die Daten analysieren."

$b Ursprung $b der $b Rebellion

Mit dem Material und der Information, die wir durch die Kaperung der Repulse erhalten haben, konnten unsere Spionageabwehragenten endgültig den Ursprung und auch das Ausmaß der Rebellion bestimmen. Diese Entdeckung ist zutiefst beunruhigend. Abtrünnige Aktivitäten innerhalb des GTI sind nicht nur auf den Zweig der Forschung und Entwicklung beschränkt, sondern es sind auch Offiziere aus den obersten Rängen des Geheimdienstdirektoriums beteiligt.

Mit sofortiger Wirkung hat die GTA jegliche Unterstützung von GTI-Operationen beendet und dieser Organisation offen den Krieg erklärt. Alle Streitkräfte, die der GTA loyal ergeben sind, einschließlich der Soyakaze und den Überresten der Flotte vom Nachrichtendienst und der Spezialoperationen, wurden wieder in die Hauptkampfgruppe der GTA eingegliedert."

3518, "$b Der $b GTI

Aufgrund der Technologie und den sensiblen Informationen, auf die der GTI Zugriff hat, stellt dieser eine erhebliche Bedrohung für die Stabilität und Sicherheit der GTA, der PVN und aller verbündeten Welten dar.

Die Mittel des GTI umfassen neben den von F&E entwickelten Schiffs- und Waffenprototypen auch die besten Militärwissenschaftler und strategischen Planer der GTA. Sie sind nicht zu unterschätzen.

Gegenüber dem GTI wird unsere wirkungsvollste Waffe die numerische Überlegenheit der zusammengefassten GTA- und PVN-Flotten sein. Unsere Aktionen müssen schnell und entscheidend sein."

3519, "$b Neue $b Entwicklungen

Unsere taktische Situation wird durch die neueste Entdeckung der Soyakaze-Besatzung erheblich verbessert. Eine Analyse des GTF Loki ermöglichte es unseren Ingenieuren, einen Konstruktionsfehler in der Strukturzusammensetzung des Loki zu erkennen. Dieser Fehler macht die Tarntechnologie des Loki praktisch nutzlos, da eine einfache Neukonfiguration der Sensorparameter es ermöglicht, dass der Loki von jedem unserer Schiffe erfasst werden kann. Alle Sensorsysteme der GTA- und PVN-Flotten wurden mit diesen neuen Informationen versorgt."

3520, "$b Unsere $b Mission

Das Oberkommando hat den Standort der Operationsbasis der GTI bekannt gegeben: Die Jotunheim-Installationsanlage im $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-System. Die Existenz und der Standort dieser Installationsanlage wurde, bis jetzt, auf der höchsten Stufe geheim gehalten. Unsere Analysten glauben, dass sich der Großteil der Rebellenführung und deren Infrastruktur auf diese Basis konzentriert.

Wenn wir eine Chance haben wollen den GTI aufzuhalten, dann muss Jotunheim zerstört werden. Die GTA wird eine sofortige, allumfassende Offensive starten, um die Installations- sowie Verteidigungsanlagen in der Umgebung auszuschalten. Melden Sie sich bei Ihren Staffelstationen für Ihre spezifischen Missionseinsatzbesprechungen."

3521, "Der $f Soyakaze wurde befohlen die GTI-Operationsbasis in $b Beta $b Aquilae$| , $h Jotunheim$| , zu zerstören. Der GTI führt ihre geheimsten Operationen in dieser Einrichtung durch, was die xenobiologische und technische Forschung miteinschließt. Wir glauben, dass der GTI hier bereits seit dem ersten Kontakt die shivanische Technologie und Psysiologie untersucht."

3522, "Diese Operation wird gemeinsam mit der $f GTD $f Intrepid und der $f PVD $f Vanguard durchgeführt. Während die terranischen und vasudanischen Flotten in ganz Beta Aquilae gegnerische Ziele angreifen, werden unsere Piloten ein Stoßangriff gegen Jotunheim selbst durchführen. Ein riesiger, koordinierter Angriff auf mehrere Fronten sollte die GTI-Streitkräfte in diesem System überwältigen und unsere Chancen gegen die Installationsanlage deutlich verbessern."

3523, "Unser Angriff auf Jotunheim wird in zwei Stufen durchgeführt. In der ersten Stufe werden $f Alpha und $f Beta angreifen und das Jägerkontingent der Installationsanlage zerstören. Das Oberkommando schätzt, dass Jotunheim in der Lage sein wird, mindestens sechs volle Staffeln einzusetzen, so dass der Verteidigungsschirm neutralisiert werden muss, bevor unsere Bomber ankommen."

3524, "Unser Angriff auf Jotunheim wird in zwei Stufen durchgeführt. In der ersten Stufe werden $f Alpha und $f Beta angreifen und das Jägerkontingent der Installationsanlage zerstören. Das Oberkommando schätzt, dass Jotunheim in der Lage sein wird, mindestens vier volle Staffeln einzusetzen, so dass der Verteidigungsschirm neutralisiert werden muss, bevor unsere Bomber ankommen."

3525, "In der zweiten Stufe werden $f Zeta und $f Omicron reinspringen und die Kreuzerbefestigungen der Installationsanlage angreifen. Sobald die Kreuzer abgeschossen wurden, werden sie Jotunheim erfassen und zerstören. Alpha und Beta werden auf Position bleiben, um Deckung zu geben."

3526, "Wegen des Mangels an Bombern an Bord der Soyakaze, werden die Staffeln Zeta und Omicron von der Intrepid beziehungsweise Vanguard zur Verfügung gestellt. Diese Piloten sind absolute Veteranen des großen Krieges mit den Shivanern sowie dem 14-jährigen Krieg zwischen unseren Spezies und haben auch bereits an mehreren Fronten gegen den GTI gekämpft. Sie sind mehr als nur qualifiziert, um Sie bei dieser Mission zu unterstützen."

3527, "Wenn Sie während eines Teils dieser Mission zusätzliche Jägerunterstützung benötigen, wird die $f Gamma$| -Staffel als Verstärkung zur Verfügung stehen. Command wird auch $f Delta und $f Epsilon nach eigenem Ermessen einsetzen, wenn die Notwendigkeit entsteht."

3528, "Wir haben nur ein begrenztes taktisches Profil über die Installationsanlage, also seien Sie darauf vorbereitet, exotische Prototypen mit unbekannten Fähigkeiten anzugreifen. Sie sind berechtigt jedes GTI-Schiff zu zerstören, welches Ihre Missionsziele beeinträchtigt. Ihr primäres Ziel ist jedoch, die Jotunheim zu eliminieren. Alle anderen Ziele sind sekundär.

Viel Glück, Piloten!"

3529, "Jotunheim wurde zerstört und damit auch die meisten Waffenprototypen und technologische Forschung des GTI. Leider ist unser Versuch, die GTI-Führung zu enthaupten fehlgeschlagen, da einige der Offiziere an Bord der Installationsanlage ihrer Zerstörung entkommen und ihrer Gefangennahme entgehen konnten. Schlimmer ist nur noch, dass die Aufständischen eine neue Superwaffe zur Verfügung haben. Das Schiff, dass die Fluchtkapseln der Jotunheim abholte ist eine Juggernaut von unglaublicher Größe, welche in der Lage ist, einen unserer Kreuzer mit nur einem einzigen Schuss zu vernichten. Feuerkraft dieser Größenordnung wurde bisher nur auf der SD Lucifer gesehen.

Aufklärungsstaffeln wurden bereits in Alarmbereitschaft versetzt, um diese neue Schiffsklasse zu verfolgen und zu identifizieren. General Tess hat mir mitgeteilt, dass unsere Staffel jederzeit angefordert werden kann, um diesen Superzerstörer anzugreifen. Wegtreten!"

3545, "Staffeln Zeta und Omicron hier. Erfassen die Kreuzer."

3546, "Command, Sie machen einen schrecklichen Fehler! Wir haben die Technologie, die Ressourcen und die Fähigkeiten, die nötig sind, um die terranische Rasse wieder auf ein festes Fundament zu stellen. Sie können es sich nicht leisten, Ihre beste Hoffnung auf Zukunft wegzuwerfen!"

3547, "Nach dem Krieg mit den Vasudanern und dem Krieg mit den Shivanern ist die GTA in Ihren letzten Zügen. Selbst die klügsten Prognosen geben der GTA nur noch zwei Jahre, bevor sie zerfällt! Die einzige Organisation, die wieder die Ordnung herstellen kann ist der GTI. Sie brauchen unsere Hilfe!"

3548, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Die Verteidigungen der Jotunheim wurden zerstört! Erfassen Sie die Installationsanlage und feuern Sie nach eigenem Ermessen. Achten Sie auf gegnerische Verstärkungen."

3549, "Command, hören Sie zu! Wir haben den Prototypen! Er ist bereit zum Einsatz. Sie können den vasudanischen Krieg innerhalb von wenigen Wochen beenden -- höchstens in Monaten -- aber der Sieg ist gesichert. Sie können das nicht einfach ignorieren!"

3550, "Das ist nicht meine Entscheidung. Die Zeiten haben sich geändert, Jotunheim. Wir sind nicht mehr im Krieg mit den Vasudanern. Wir sind Verbündete, keine Feinde."

3551, "Wir sind nur dem Namen nach Verbündete. Sie wissen, dass dieser Waffenstillstand nur so lange andauern wird, bis sich eine Rasse gut genug erholt hat, um zum letzten Schlag gegen die andere auszuholen. Wenn eine unserer Spezies zerstört werden muss, dann lassen Sie uns verdammt nochmal sichergehen, dass wir diejenigen sind, die am Ende am Leben sind."

3552, "Terranische Piloten, sicherlich können Sie sehen, was hier los ist! Denken Sie an Ihre Freunde und Ihren Angehörigen, die vierzehn Jahre für die Unterstützung der terranischen Sache gekämpft haben und dafür gestorben sind! Jetzt wollen Ihre Kommandeure alles wegwerfen, wofür diese standen!"

3553, "Piloten, Sie werden die Übertragungen der Jotunheim ignorieren und sich auf Ihre Missionsziele konzentrieren!"

3554, "Ich weiß nicht, Command. Sie erwähnten nichts davon in der Einsatzbesprechung. Sicherlich--"

3555, "Erledigen Sie Ihre Missionsziele, Pilot! Das ist ein Befehl!"

3556, "Was ist mit den Befehlen der letzten vierzehn Jahren, häh? Was ist mit allem, wofür wir gekämpft haben? Meine Verlobte war auf der Eisenhower, verdammt!"

3557, "Terranische Paranoia. Wie typisch. Seien Sie froh, dass unsere Regierungen über solche Ansichten hinweggekommen sind, Verblendeter. Ich würde Sie nicht so einfach begnadigen."

3558, "Schau dir dein eigenes verräterisches Parlament an, du sandfressender Zod und dann erzähl uns, dass wir nicht paranoid sind! Wie lauten Ihre Befehle, Jotunheim?"

3559, "Zeta-Staffel, bleiben Sie auf Ihrem Posten! Zeta!"

3560, "Piloten, wir können es uns nicht leisten, das Momentum zu verlieren. Wir versuchen zusätzliche Streitkräfte zu Ihrer Position umzuleiten. Halten Sie sich bereit."

3561, "An alle verbündeten Streitkräfte, die Kavallerie ist angekommen! Die Gladiator, Minotaur, Mecross und Tatenen stehen zur Unterstützung bereit. Bringen das volle Sperrfeuer unserer Türme auf die Jotunheim hervor."

3562, "Jotunheim-Angriffsstreitmacht, hier ist die Soyakaze. Seien Sie darauf hingewiesen, dass wir durch Codeschnipsel erfahren haben, dass sich eine große Rebellenstreitmacht auf dem Weg zu Ihrer Position befindet. Zerstören Sie die Jotunheim so schnell wie möglich!"

3563, "Bestätigt, Soyakaze. Die Jotunheim ist kritisch geworden. Geben Sie uns noch ein paar Augenblicke."

3564, "Entschuldigen Sie, Command. Aber wir werden diesen Krieg gewinnen, egal ob es Ihnen gefällt oder nicht. Es wird vielleicht ein oder zwei Generationen dauern, aber am Ende wird die terranische Rasse siegreich hervorgehen!"

3565, "Die Jotunheim hat Fluchtkapseln abgeworfen. Greifen Sie die Kapseln nicht an, Piloten! Wir schicken eine Staffel Transporter, um sie zu kapern."

3566, "Die Jotunheim wurde zerstört! An alle Einheiten, halten Sie Abstand!"

3567, "Command, ich empfange hier eine enorme Sprungsignatur! Die Messwerte sind über der Skala!"

3568, "Was zur Hölle ist das?"

$b Apokalypse

Durch das Erscheinen der neuesten Superwaffe des GTI wurde die GTA und PVN in ein Chaos gestürzt. Das Undenkbare ist passiert. Irgendwie hat es der Galaktisch Terranische Geheimdienst geschafft ein Schiff mit der Größe, der Panzerung und der Feuerkraft zu erwerben, dass es mit der SD Lucifer aufnehmen kann. Vorläufige Scans deuten darauf hin, dass es sich um eine Verschmelzung von terranischer und shivanischer Technologie handelt, die ganz anders ist, als in unserem sonstigen Arsenal."

3574, "$b Die $b Hades

Wir wissen jetzt, dass dieses Schiff, das als Hades bezeichnet wird, der Angreifer gewesen ist, der die PVD Hope stark beschädigt und die gesamte vasudanische Blockade am $quoteBeta Aquilae$quote-Knoten in Delta Serpentis zerstört hat. Seitdem hat die Hades mehrere verbündete Stützpunkte in ganz Beta Aquilae und Vega ausgelöscht.

Terranische und vasudanische Streitkräfte versuchen eine Strategie zu entwickeln, um dieser neuen Bedrohung entgegenzuwirken. Alle Piloten wurden in eine $quoteZehn Minuten Alarmbereitschaft$quote versetzt."

3575, "$r ROTER $r ALARM! 

Die $f PVI $f Egyptos wird angegriffen! Die Aufklärung hat mehrere $h GTI$| -Jäger- und -Bomberstaffeln gesichtet, die alle auf die Station zufliegen."

3576, "Wir starten alarmmäßig die Staffeln $f Alpha und $f Beta$| , um das erschöpfte Jägerkontingent der Station zu verstärken. Leider haben wir keine endgültigen Informationen über die Stärke der $h GTI$| -Streitkräften in diesem System. Wenn Command feststellt, dass der $h GTI genügend Feuerkraft hat, um unsere Position zu gefährden, muss die Station evakuiert werden."

3577, "Die meisten unserer Schiffe durchsuchen das System nach der $h Hades$| , so dass Sie nur minimale logistische Unterstützung haben. Halten Sie den $h GTI so lange auf, bis zusätzliche Jäger eingesetzt werden können, um Sie zu unterstützen."

3578, "Die PVI Egyptos wurde zerstört! Tausende unschuldige Vasudaner sind heute gestorben und der Vega-Knoten ist jetzt ohne jegliche Verteidigung gegen den GTI-Angriff."

3579, "Es ist bedauerlich, dass Sie der gleichen Taktik zum Opfer gefallen sind, die wir vor vier Jahren selbst gegen die Vasudaner verwendet haben. Die Hauptschwäche der Installationsanlage der Karnak-Klasse ist, seitdem Sie in der Operation Cardinal Spear von der GTA herausgefunden wurde, Standardmaterial in jedem Fluglehrplan der Verteidigungsliga. Haben Sie während des Militärgeschichtsunterricht geschlafen, Pilot?

Ob Sie überrascht wurden oder einfach nicht rechtzeitig den Bomber abgefangen haben, ist nicht das Problem. Command gab Ihnen einen direkten Befehl und Sie konnten nicht mit der Geschwindigkeit und Präzision reagieren, die diese Situation erfordert hätte. In diesem aktuellen Konflikt können wir uns das Risiko nicht leisten, dass einer unserer besten Piloten in einem kritischen Moment nicht rechtzeitig reagiert.

Ich bedaure Ihnen mitteilen zu müssen, dass das Oberkommando Sie aus dem aktuellen Dienst zieht, bis die Rebellion unter Kontrolle ist. Wegtreten!"

3580, "Breche deinen Angriff ab, sobald du hörst, dass der Bomber den Reaktor erfasst. Du hast genug Zeit, zum Reaktor zu kommen, bevor er es tut.

Warum spielst du nicht auch die FSPort Anpassung von Cardinal Spear, um den Hintergrund dieser Mission kennenzulernen?

Vielleicht gibt es zu dieser aber auch ebenfalls bereits eine deutsche Übersetzung? Schaue dafür einfach unter http://www.moddb.com/mods/freiraum-freespace-auf-deutsch nach."

3581, "Die PVC Thebes wurde mit allen Besatzungsmitgliedern an Bord einfach verdampft. Die Evakuierten von der Station, welche an Bord der Thebes gingen, starben ebenfalls beim grausamen Angriff der Hades."

3582, "Es ist ein Glück, dass Sie die PVC Harthor und die entkommenen Transporter retten konnten. Die Überlebenden schickten ihre Dankbarkeit.

Wir sind auch davon beeindruckt, dass Sie den GTI-Überraschungsangriff gegen den Reaktor der Egyptos vereiteln konnten. Ihr schnelles Denken und Ihre schnelle Reaktion haben dabei geholfen, wertvolle Zeit für die Überlebenden zu verschaffen, um dem Angriff des GTI zu entkommen. Gut gemacht!"

3583, "Wir sind davon enttäuscht, dass Sie die PVC Hathor nicht vor dem GTI-Angriff retten konnten. In Anbetracht der heutigen Ereignisse hätten sogar ein paar hundert zusätzliche Überlebende die Moral gesteigert."

3584, "Da die GTI-Jäger überall ankommen, ist es eine Frage des Glücks, ob du in der Nähe der Hathor sein wirst, wenn sie angegriffen wird. Wenn du deinen Staffelpiloten zuweist, sie zu beschützen, verschaffst du dir etwas Zeit, aber du musst für ihre Verteidigung bereit sein, wenn die Roskva-Staffel ankommt."

3585, "In Anerkennung Ihrer Leistung in unseren Operationen mit verbündeten Vasudanern, werden Sie hiermit mit der Medaille der Vasudanischen Allianz ausgezeichnet. Für Ihre mutige Verteidigung der PVI Egyptos, der PVD Hope und vieler anderer vasudanischen Schiffe sendet das vasudanische Parlament seinen Dank."

3586, "Zu unseren direkten Verlusten an die Hades gehören jetzt die PVI Egyptos, die PVD Vanguard und zwölf Kreuzer. Für unser aller Willen, lassen Sie uns hoffen, dass bald eine Schwäche in ihrer Verteidigung gefunden werden kann.

Wir haben die Sensoraufschaltung auf die Juggernaut wiedererlangt und versuchen sie durch den Subraum zu verfolgen. Unser Geschwader wird so schnell wie möglich wiedereingesetzt, um das Schiff abzufangen, wenn es an seinem Ziel ankommt. Melden Sie sich im Laufschritt im Einsatzbesprechungsraum."

3598, "Es ist gut, Sie zu sehen, Piloten. Die Rebellen greifen uns mit Wucht an. Bitte geben Sie Deckung!"

3599, "Wir sind so schnell gekommen, wie wir konnten, Egyptos. Wie ist Ihr Status?"

3600, "Wir haben leichte Schäden erlitten. Unsere Jäger haben drei Angriffswellen neutralisiert, aber die Rebellen sind nicht so leicht zu entmutigen. Wir erwarten, dass in Kürze noch mehr Bomber ankommen werden."

3601, "Die Rebellen haben einen Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse namens Berserker im Einsatz."

3602, "Ein zweiter Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse, die Mjolnir, ist in das Gebiet eingeflogen."

3603, "Eine neue Welle an GTI-Bomber ist angekommen! Verteidigen Sie uns, Piloten!"

3604, "Hüllenintegrität fällt. Wir evakuieren alles nicht erforderliche Personal. Startbuchten sind in Bereitschaft."

3605, "Wir starten Transporter! Evakuierungsgruppe A hat den Hangar verlassen."

3606, "Evakuierungsgruppe B ist gestartet!"

3607, "Evakuierungsgruppe C hat den Hangar geräumt!"

3608, "Wir haben die Berserker zerstört. Gut gemacht, Piloten!"

3609, "Die Mjolnir wurde zerstört!"

3610, "Schadensrate steigt! Allgemeine Evakuierung ist jetzt im Gange. Das gesamte Personal bewegt sich zu den äußeren Pylonen."

3611, "Hier ist die PVC Hathor. Wir sind hier, um bei den Evakuierungsbemühungen zu helfen. Beginnen mit der Andockannäherung."

3612, "Wir haben mit der Station angedockt. Überführen jetzt die Evakuierten und die Stationsaufzeichnungen."

3613, "Übertragung der Hauptmaterialien abgeschlossen. Wir docken jetzt ab!"

3614, "Alpha, die Hathor wird angegriffen! Decken Sie diesen Kreuzer oder wir werden die Evakuierten verlieren!"

3615, "Alpha, decken Sie die Transporter! Sie werden angegriffen!"

3616, "Die Hathor wurde zerstört!"

3617, "PVC Thebes bei der Andockannäherung. Halten uns für die Überführung von Evakuierten bereit."

3618, "Andocksequenz abgeschlossen. Evakuierung des verbliebenen nicht erforderlichen Personals ist jetzt im Gange."

3619, "Ankommende Sprungsignatur! Die Rebellen-Juggernaut fliegt in das Gebiet ein!"

3620, "Piloten, halten Sie Ihre Verteidigung der Station aufrecht! Wir setzen Bomber ein, um die Hades anzugreifen!"

3621, "Die Hades hat das Feuer eröffnet! Wir erleiden schwere Hüllenschäden!"

3622, "Egyptos, starten Sie sofort alle verbliebenen Jäger und Transporter!"

3623, "Startbuchten außer Betrieb. Kritische Systeme versagen. Rächen Sie uns!"

3624, "Die Egyptos wurde zerstört!"

3625, "Hier ist die Theta-Staffel. Wir greifen die Rebellen-Juggernaut an!"

3626, "Die Hades hat das Gebiet verlassen."

3627, "Alle Schiffe, kehren Sie zur Basis zurück! Alpha und Beta, Sie starten dann sofort wieder alarmmäßig, um beim Gegenangriff zu helfen."

3628, "Alle Schiffe, kehren Sie zur Basis zurück und warten Sie auf weitere Befehle."

3629, "Piloten, helfen Sie uns! Ein GTI-Bomber bereitet sich darauf vor, unseren Hauptreaktor anzugreifen!"

3630, "Verdammt! Alpha 1, hören Sie ganz genau zu. Brechen Sie Ihren Angriff sofort ab und fliegen Sie direkt zur nächstgelegenen Reaktortür. Die Türen befinden sich zwischen zwei vertikalen Pylonen im Außenring."

3631, "Fliegen Sie durch den Zugangsschacht und fangen Sie den Bomber ab, bevor er den Hauptreaktor zerstören kann! Wenn der Reaktor explodiert, wird er die gesamte Station mitnehmen!"

3632, "Die Strahlung in der Zentralkammer wird Sensoren und Kommunikation stören, weshalb Sie manuell zielen müssen. Viel Glück, Alpha 1!"

3633, "Der Hauptreaktor der Station ist kritisch geworden! An alle Jäger, räumen Sie das Gebiet!"

3634, "Hingabe der Hoffnung"

3635, "Der Spieler muss die Subsysteme der Hades in einem verzweifelten Versuch scannen, um eine Schwachstelle zu finden."

3636, "Das Oberkommando hat die $h Hades in der Nähe des Sprungknotens nach $b Deneb gefunden. Der Superzerstörer fliegt ohne Eskorte, bleibt aber selbst so ein ernstzunehmender Gegner. Wir können keinen direkten Angriff riskieren, bis wir mehr Informationen über seine Stärken und Schwächen haben."

3637, "$f Alpha $f 1$| , Sie wurden ausgewählt, einen Aufklärungsflug über die Hades zu fliegen. Das Oberkommando hat Daten über die $b Kommunikation$| -, $b Sensoren$| -, $b Waffen$| - und der $b Navigation$| -Subsysteme des Kriegsschiffes angefordert. Informationen über den $b Hanger und das $b Antrieb$| subsystem wären ebenfalls extrem wertvoll, aber werden als nicht so kritisch erachtet."

3638, "Die $f GTSC $f Herschel wird diese Operation überwachen. Ihr Jägercomputer wird mit dem Bordcomputer der Herschel verbunden und Ihr Jäger lädt somit automatisch all Ihre Scandaten hoch, sobald diese erlangt werden."

3639, "Um sich vor der starken Strahlbewaffnung der Hades zu schützen, wird die Herschel versuchen, ihre Sensorsignatur zu maskieren. Dadurch wird verhindert, dass die Computer der Hades eine Zielaufschaltung auf das Schiff erlangen können und ein manuelles Erfassen sollte aufgrund der geringen Größe der Herschel fast unmöglich sein. Wenn wir Glück haben, werden sich die Kanoniere der Hades nicht mit ihr beschäftigen."

3640, "Wählen Sie Ihre Waffenbestückung schnell, Pilot! Wir haben nicht viel Zeit, bevor die Hades das System verlässt. Das ist die beste Gelegenheit, die Informationen zu bekommen, die wir benötigen. Lassen Sie uns das Beste daraus machen!"

3641, "Die Ereignisse, von denen wir gerade Zeuge wurden, haben die Notwendigkeit, die GTI-Rebellion zu besiegen, dramatisch unterstrichen. Die Hades überstand sowohl die Kollision wie auch die Explosion mit einem vollständig bewaffneten Zerstörer der Typhon-Klasse. Die Besatzung der PVD Hope opferte ihr Leben und ihr Schiff in einem tapferen Versuch, der GTA und der PVN den Sieg zu bringen. Obwohl sie dabei erfolglos waren, werden sie mit Ehre in Erinnerung bleiben.

Leider muss sich das Oberkommando nun mit den Folgen des gescheiterten Angriffes befassen. Obwohl die Hope ihre Piloten und das nicht erforderliche Personal vor ihren Schlag gegen die Hades abgesetzt hatte, haben wir eine gut ausgebildete und hochqualifizierte Kommandobesatzung verloren. Mit unseren geschwächten Flotten, die sich über mehrere Systeme verteilt haben, um die Rebellion einzudämmen, wird es immer offensichtlicher, dass wir nicht in der Lage sein werden, schnell genug genügend Streitkräfte aufzustellen, um der Hades entgegenzuwirken. Wir haben keine andere Wahl als mit dem, was wir haben, anzugreifen. Das Oberkommando hofft darauf, dass wir mit den Informationen, die wir sowohl auf der Repulse, sowie mit den Scandaten, die wir auf unserer Aufklärung erhalten haben, in der Lage sein werden, eine Schwachstelle bei der Hades zu finden, bevor sie ihr Ziel erreicht."

3642, "Sie haben jedoch nicht die erforderlichen Subsysteme auf der Hades gescannt, so dass wir gezwungen sind, uns allein auf die Daten der Langstreckensensoren der Herschel verlassen zu müssen, die sie übermittelt hat. Ohne die taktischen Informationen, die wir uns erhofft hatten, fehlt unseren Taktikern das Wissen, das sie brauchen, um einen wirksamen Gegenangriff zu planen.

Wir hatten Sie für diese Mission aufgrund Ihrer eindrucksvollen Liste an erfolgreichen Aufklärungsmissionen ausgewählt und das Oberkommando ist sehr davon enttäuscht, dass Sie ihrem Ruf nicht gerecht werden konnten. Vielleicht sind Ihre Fähigkeiten in standardmäßigen Angriffs- und Verteidigungsmissionen besser aufgehoben, anstatt in Situationen, die ein schnelles Denken und taktische Improvisation erfordern.

General Tess hat Ihre Rückversetzung auf die GTD Intrepid genehmigt. Die Eindämmungsbemühungen werden von jemanden mit Ihren Pilotenfähigkeiten sehr profitieren, aber für unseren Angriff auf die Hades benötigen wir Piloten, die sich in allen Bereichen des Kampfeinsatzes auszeichnen. Die Soyakaze wird in sechs Stunden nach Deneb springen, also müssen Sie bis dahin Ihre Sachen packen. Ihr Transporter wird im Hangar auf Sie warten."

3643, "Schalte die ersten paar Jäger sofort aus und scanne zwischen den Wellen ein oder zwei Subsysteme. Wenn du das weiter so machst, solltest du in der Lage sein, mindestens drei Subsysteme zu erhalten. Stelle sicher, dass du die Kommunikations-, Sensoren-, Waffen- und Navigationssubsysteme vor allen anderen scannst."

3644, "Unsere Aufklärung war überwiegend erfolgreich, da Sie drei der benötigten vier Subsysteme der Hades scannen konnten. Obwohl wir auf ein vollständiges taktisches Profil der Juggernaut gehofft hatten, war Ihre Leistung unter Berücksichtigung der Umstände zufriedenstellend. Unseren Taktikern wird es schwerfallen, einen wirksamen Gegenangriff zu planen, aber die gewonnenen Daten sollten unsere Chancen erheblich verbessern."

3645, "Unsere Aufklärung war ein voller Erfolg, da Sie alle vier benötigten Subsysteme auf der Hades scannen konnten. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit! Unsere Taktiker analysieren, während wir sprechen, die Daten und wir erwarten in wenigen Stunden einen vorläufigen Bericht zu erhalten. Diese Informationen werden unsere Chancen im kommenden Gegenangriff deutlich verbessern."

3646, "Zusätzlich waren Sie in der Lage das Jägerhangar der Hades zu scannen. Die Taktiker haben große Beunruhigung durch Ihre Erkenntnisse gezeigt, aber deren Analyse bleibt bis auf weiteres als geheim eingestuft."

3647, "Sie konnten auch einen der Antriebe der Hades scannen. Unsere Taktiker bringen Ihre Erkenntnisse in ihre Analyse mit ein, während sie nach einer Schwachstelle in der Verteidigung der Juggernaut suchen. Diese Information kann vielleicht erklären, warum die Hades vorübergehend deaktiviert war."

3648, "General Tess hat Ihre Leistung in den letzten Missionen ganz besonders beachtet und Sie dazu ausgewählt, den Angriff gegen die Hades anzuführen. Ihre Vertrautheit mit den Verteidigungen der Juggernaut gibt uns einen zusätzlichen Vorteil im bevorstehenden Kampf und Ihre nachgewiesenen Führungs- und Pilotenqualitäten sind in diesem Geschwader beispiellos.

Das Oberkommando hat unseren Strategen und Taktikern sechs Stunden Zeit gegeben einen Schlachtplan zu entwerfen, nachdem die Soyakaze nach Deneb springen wird, um die Hades zu verfolgen. Für die Zwischenzeit schlage ich Ihnen vor, dass Sie sich etwas ausruhen. Wegtreten!"

3665, "Interessanter Fund, Alpha! Die Daten des Jägerhangars rechtfertigen weitere Untersuchungen."

3666, "Eins abgehakt, bleiben noch drei. Machen Sie weiter so, Pilot!"

3667, "Gute Arbeit. Sie sind bei der Hälfte, Alpha 1!"

3668, "Ausgezeichnet! Es gibt nur noch ein letztes Subsystem zum Scannen."

3669, "Alle vier Hauptsubsysteme wurden gescannt!"

3670, "Setzen Sie Ihre Scans fort! Wir benötigen noch die Daten zu den verbliebenen Subsystemen."

3671, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Alpha 1! Fallen Sie zur Herschel zurück! Ihr Zielcomputer hat die Koordinaten."

3672, "Herschel, die Soyakaze hat zusätzliche Daten über den Subraumantrieb der Hades angefordert. Ihre neuen Befehle sind, die Hades zu überwachen, während sie ihren Sprung nach Deneb einleitet. Piloten, bleiben Sie auf Position, bis die Herschel ihre Mission abgeschlossen hat."

3673, "Der Computeruplink ist in Betrieb und aktiv. Alle Systeme sind funktionsfähig."

3674, "Gut! Alpha, die Hades wird den Sprungknoten in weniger als fünf Minuten erreichen. Sie müssen alle Daten sammeln, die Sie können, bevor sie abfliegen kann."

3675, "Die Staffeln Beta und Gamma stehen Ihnen zur Verfügung. Delta und Epsilon sind in Bereitschaft. Viel Glück, Pilot!"

3676, "Neuer Kontakt auf den Sensoren ... es ist die PVD Hope! Hope, Ihre Befehle waren, sich nach Alpha Centauri für Reparaturen zurückzuziehen. Was tun Sie hier in Vega?"

3677, "Wir sind hier, um uns gegen den GTI zu rächen. Alle Piloten, halten Sie Abstand von der Hades!"

3678, "General, Ihr Schiff wird diesen Einsatz nicht überstehen! Halten Sie sich zurück und kehren Sie sofort zur Basis zurück!"

3679, "Überleben steht nur an zweiter Stelle zum Sieg, Command. Sa Vasuda!"

3680, "Die Hope wurde zerstört!"

3681, "Wir lesen ein Hauptversagen im Antriebsbereich der Juggernaut auf! Die Hades wurde deaktiviert! Alle Piloten, halten Sie sich für eine Missionsaktualisierung bereit."

3682, "Piloten, wir bereiten Bomberstaffeln vor, um die Hades zu zerstören. Ihre Ziele sind ... warten Sie ... die Antriebe der Hades gehen wieder in Betrieb!"

3683, "Die Hades ist nach Deneb gesprungen. Piloten, kehren Sie zur Soyakaze zurück."

3684, "Wir setzen eine andere Jägerstaffel ein, um Sie zu unterstützen, Alpha."

3685, "Wir haben die Herschel verloren! Piloten, halten Sie sich bereit. Wir setzen einen anderen Wissenschaftskreuzer bei Ihrem Standort ein."

3686, "Wir haben die Herschel verloren! Alpha 1, fahren Sie mit Ihren Scans fort. Wir sind noch in der Lage diese Informationen von Ihrem Jäger zu bergen."

3687, "Command, wir werden angegriffen! Fordern Deckung durch Jäger an!"

3688, "Piloten, brechen Sie ab und verteidigen Sie die Herschel! Ihr Zielcomputer hat die Koordinaten. Wir werden unsere Mission fortsetzen, sobald der Wissenschaftskreuzer gesichert ist."

3689, "Command, wir benötigen mehr Jägerdeckung! Wir überleben keine weitere Salve!"

3690, "Sieht so aus, als ob die Sensormaskierung richtig funktioniert. Gut so, andernfalls hätte uns dieser Schuss einfach pulverisiert!"

3691, "Letztes Gefecht"

3692, "Es ist groß! Es ist ein Feind! Jage es hoch!"

3693, "$b * $b GTD $b Soyakaze
$b * $b Vega-System
$b * $b 01. $b Juni $b 2335

$b Die $b Rebellion $b vom $b GTI

Die GTA, PVN und der GTI befinden sich jetzt in einem allumfassenden Konflikt, der die zukünftige terranisch-vasudanische Geschichte bestimmen könnte. Obwohl der Großteil der GTI-Flotte in Beta Aquilae und Vega unter Kontrolle ist, ist das GTI-Flaggschiff Hades nach wie vor flüchtig und muss daher aufgehalten werden. Die Soyakaze ist das einzige Schiff in Reichweite, welches die Juggernaut abfangen kann, bevor sie ihr oberstes Ziel ausführen kann. Sieg oder Niederlage werden sich in den nächsten Stunden entscheiden.

Sie werden über das Hades-Projekt soweit informiert, wie Sie es unbedingt wissen müssen und Sie werden hiermit darauf hingewiesen, dass alle Informationen diesbezüglich unter Geheimhaltungsstufe Omega klassifiziert sind. Das Ausplaudern dieser Informationen, egal ob direkt oder indirekt an Personen, die nicht ausdrücklich von der Galaktisch Terranischen Allianz genehmigt wurden ist eine verräterische Straftat, die mit dem Tode bestraft wird."

3694, "$b Das $b Hades-Projekt

Die GTD Hades wurde 2324 konzipiert und entworfen, als klar wurde, dass der terranisch-vasudanische Krieg nicht entscheidend in einigen Monaten gewonnen werden würde. Dieser Superzerstörer wäre gegenüber Bomber-, Kreuzer- und Zerstörerangriffen nahezu unangreifbar und könnte auch ohne weitere Unterstützung großangelegte planetarische Angriffe durchführen. Der Bau des Schiffes begann im folgenden Jahr in den $quoteDelta Serpentis$quote-Schiffswerfen.

Als 2335 die Shivaner ankamen, war die Hades gerade fast fertiggestellt worden. Der GTI führte umfangreiche Untersuchungen an diesen Außerirdischen, insbesondere der Lucifer, durch und bauten die neuen Entwicklungen in die Hades zur Verwendung ein. Mit ihrer endgültigen Waffe, die jetzt mit shivanischer Strahlbewaffnung und terranisch-shivanischen Hybridsystemen ausgestattet war, warteten die GTI-Streitkräfte auf den Einsatzbefehl des GTA-Oberkommandos.

Aber dieser Befehl kam nie. Im Gegensatz zu jedem anderen Waffenstillstand im Verlauf des terranisch-vasudanischen Krieges hat dieser gehalten. Die GTA und die PVN haben ihre Differenzen beiseitegeschoben, um der shivanischen Bedrohung zu begegnen und entwickelten einen widerwilligen Respekt voreinander."

3695, "$b Das $b Ziel $b des $b GTI

Der Galaktisch Terranische Geheimdienst konnte jedoch nicht einfach die Investion und den Impuls von zehn Jahren der Arbeit an der Hades verwerfen. Nach Aussage von gefangengenommenen Agenten, kam der GTI zu dem Schluss, dass die GTA ihr ursprüngliches Ziel aus den Augen verloren hatte und beschloss daher, die Dinge selbst in die Hand zu nehmen.

Der GTI scheint sich für die Stürzung der GTA-Regierung positioniert zu haben, sobald sich die Terraner genug vom großen Krieg erholt hätten, um wieder für sich selbst verantwortlich zu sein. Sobald die Shivaner besiegt worden wären, hätte der GTI den terranisch-vasudanischen Vertrag aufgelöst und zum letzten Schlag gegen die PVN und der vasudanischen Regierung ausgeholt. Der terranisch-vasudanische Krieg würde endlich gewonnen werden."

3696, "$b Ein $b abschließender $b Schachzug

Die Enthüllung der GTI-Verschwörung hat ihren Plan daran gehindert verwirklicht zu werden, aber der GTI kann noch immer sein oberstes Ziel erreichen. Unsere Aufklärung über die Hades hat gezeigt, dass ihre Antriebe mit shivanischen Komponenten verbessert wurden, was es der Juggernaut ermöglichen kann, Sprungknoten zu verwenden, die für terranische und vasudanische Schiffe zu instabil sind. Das Oberkommando ist davon überzeugt, dass die Hades, anstatt einem zufälligen Weg der Zerstörung zu folgen auf den Weg nach Altair und Aldebaran über den wechselhaften Altair-Sprungknoten in Deneb ist.

Dieses Manöver würde es der Hades praktisch erlauben hinter die vasudanischen Linien zu schlüpfen, jenseits jeglicher Abfangmöglichkeit durch GTA- oder PVN-Streitkräfte. Der Altair-Sprungknoten in Deneb ist für unsere Schiffe nicht mehr stabil genug, was bedeutet, dass jeder Gegenangriff über den langen Weg über Alpha Centauri erfolgen muss. Bis dahin hätte die Hades mehr als genug Zeit gehabt, um die vasudanischen Heimatsysteme ohne jeglichen Widerstand zu verwüsten."

3697, "$b Unser $b Gegenzug

Es gibt einige Leute innerhalb der GTA, die den GTI in diesem Konflikt bevorzugen. Tatsächlich sind viele Offiziere und Piloten zum GTI übergelaufen und viele andere haben auch behauptet, dass sich die Vasudaner genauso wie der GTI verhalten würden, wenn Sie in der gleichen Position wären. Ich kann nur antworten, indem ich sage, dass ich glaube, dass dies hier das Richtige ist und ich glaube, dass die Vasudaner uns genauso verteidigen würden, wenn die Situation umgekehrt wäre.

Es kann für jede Spezies schwierig sein, die Schrecken der vergangenen vierzehn Jahre zu vergessen, aber die Vasudaner scheinen Ihren Teil des Handels einzuhalten. Das Parlamentarische Vasudanische Imperium arbeitete mit ihrer Navy weiterhin eng mit der GTA in unserem Feldzug zusammen, die Lucifer zu verfolgen und zu zerstören, obwohl die Verwüstung von Vasuda Prime ihre Hauptmotivation dafür beseitigt hatte. Und selbst heute noch teilen sich die GTA und die PVN militärische Ressourcen und Informationen. Wir sollten sie für ihre fortgesetzte Unterstützung mit unser eigenen Unterstützung ehren. Nur die Geschichte wird bestimmen, ob wir damit die richtige Wahl getroffen haben."

3698, "Die $h Hades wurde zu einem verlassenen Frachtdepot im Orbit von $b Deneb $b III verfolgt. Diese ehemals wohlhabende Kolonie wurde Anfang des Jahres von den Shivanern völlig zerstört und die zerstörten Überreste vieler Kriegsschiffe treiben nach wie vor in der Nähe. Die Antriebe der Hades sind gegenwärtig ausgeschaltet und wir glauben, dass ihre Besatzung den Schaden repariert, der durch die Kollision mit der $f PVD $f Hope verursacht wurde. Dies kann vielleicht unsere einzige Gelegenheit sein, die Juggernaut zu zerstören, bevor sie $b Altair erreicht."

3699, "Während wir sprechen, macht die $f Soyakaze gerade den Sprung nach $b Deneb$| . Vorgelagerte Jägerstaffeln werden sofort nach der Ankunft der Soyakaze im System gestartet und die Soyakaze wird, sobald ihre Sprungantriebe wiederaufgeladen wurden, sich selbst in eine Position begeben, um die Hades direkt herauszufordern. Die Hades hat fünf Hauptstrahlkanonen, welche zerstört werden müssen, damit die Soyakaze eine Chance auf den Sieg hat."

3700, "Die $f Alpha$| -Staffel wird einen taktischen Sturmangriff fliegen, indem sie $b Tsunamis dazu verwendet, die Strahlgeschützstellungen der Hades zu zerstören. Die $f Beta$| -Staffel wird dabei decken. Wenn die Soyakaze ankommt, um die Hades zu konfrontieren, werden auch die Staffeln $f Delta und $f Epsilon eingesetzt."

3701, "Wir haben nur ein begrenztes Zeitfenster zur Verfügung, um die Hades zu zerstören, bevor sie ihre Tätigkeit im Depot beendet und das System verlässt. Die Fähigkeiten dieses Kriegsschiffes sind unvorstellbar und in den Händen des GTI ist sie eine schreckliche Waffe.

Die Sicherheit der terranischen und vasudanischen Spezies liegt jetzt in Ihren Händen, Piloten. Sie kennen die Konsequenzen des Versagens. Viel Glück!"

3702, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Piloten! Die Hades wurde zerstört und die GTI-Rebellion gibt es nicht mehr. Alle verbliebenen GTI-Streitkräfte im terranisch-vasudanischen Raum haben sich ergeben. Hätten wir hier versagt, würde jetzt der GTI die Geschichtsbücher schreiben."

3703, "Willkommen auf der GTD Intrepid, Piloten. Die Zerstörung der GTD Soyakaze ist eine Tragödie für jeden in der Allianz, vor allem für diejenigen, die erst vor kurzem noch auf der GTD Krios stationiert waren. Glücklicherweise ging die Soyakaze nicht umsonst verloren. Die Hades wurde zerstört und die GTI-Rebellion gibt es nicht mehr. Alle verbliebenen GTI-Streitkräfte im terranisch-vasudanischen Raum haben sich ergeben."

3704, "Mitglieder der provisorischen GTA-Regierung haben bereits mit den Vorbereitungen des Wiederaufbaus in Zusammenarbeit mit unseren vasudanischen Verbündeten begonnen. Es ist eine Ironie, dass dieser Konflikt unsere beiden Spezies keineswegs zerrissen, sondern sie sogar näher als je zuvor zusammengebracht hat. General Amentep, Kommandeur der PVD Guardian und der 13. vasudanischen Kampfgruppe hat das Interesse bekundet, sich persönlich mit den Piloten zu treffen, die gegen die Hades geflogen sind -- eine seltene Geste eines Vasudaners."

3705, "Trümmer der Hades regnen noch immer auf Deneb III hinab. Wegen der empfindlichen Art der Technologie, die dieser jetzt beherbergt, wird der Planet unter Quarantäne gestellt, bis das Wrack beseitigt werden kann. Das terranische Oberkommando hat alle Daten in Bezug auf die Technologie, die in diesem Einsatz verwendet wurde, als geheim eingestuft, obwohl wir wohl erwarten können, dass diese Fortschritte in zukünftigen terranisch und vasudanischen Kriegsschiffentwürfen zu sehen sein werden."

3706, "Wir haben dabei versagt, die Hades aufzuhalten, bevor sie ihre Antriebe reparieren konnte, womit die GTI-Superwaffe erfolgreich nach Altair springen konnte. Es sind erst wenige Stunden seit Ende der Schlacht vergangen, aber unsere schlimmsten Befürchtungen wurden bestätigt.

Wir haben bereits Berichte über die Verwüstungen, die in Altair und Aldebaran angerichtet wurden, erhalten. Hunderttausende Vasudaner werden für tot gehalten und viele der hochrangigsten Offiziere der PVN haben rituellen Selbstmord begangen, einschließlich General Amentep, Kommandeur der PVD Guardian und der 13. vasudanischen Kampfgruppe. Am besorgniserregendsten ist die Tatsache, dass $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Zellen in Altair damit begonnen haben, ihre Phrasen zu ändern und behaupten, dass die prophezeiten großen Zerstörer nicht die Shivaner sind, sondern die Terraner."

3707, "Vielleicht sollte unser Sieg einfach nicht sein. In unserer Schlacht gegen die Hades waren die Chancen gegen uns und die Gefühle von vierzehn Jahren werden nicht so einfach durch die Ereignisse von sechs Monaten beiseitegeschoben. Während wir sprechen, laufen terranische Schiffe in großer Anzahl zum GTI über und untergetauchte Mitglieder des Geheimdienstdirektoriums sind wiederaufgetaucht, um in Delta Serpentis die Macht zu ergreifen. Angesichts des überwältigenden Widerstandes unserer ehemaligen Verbündeten hat sich General Tess mit der Soyakaze ergeben."

3708, "Vielleicht sollte unser Sieg einfach nicht sein. In unserer Schlacht gegen die Hades waren die Chancen gegen uns und die Gefühle von vierzehn Jahren werden nicht so einfach durch die Ereignisse von sechs Monaten beiseitegeschoben. Während wir sprechen, laufen terranische Schiffe in großer Anzahl zum GTI über und untergetauchte Mitglieder des Geheimdienstdirektoriums sind wiederaufgetaucht, um in Delta Serpentis die Macht zu ergreifen."

3709, "Unser Versagen hat Unglück über unsere verwüsteten Systeme gebracht. Obwohl die Kriege gegen die Vasudaner und Shivaner vorüber sind, haben wir den Preis vielleicht mit unseren Seelen bezahlt."

3710, "Zerstöre Strahlkanonen"

3720, "Alpha und Beta, wir schätzen, dass wir weniger als zwei Minuten brauchen, bis unsere Subraumantriebe wiederaufgeladen sind. Zerstören Sie in dieser Zeit so viele Türme der Hades, wie Sie können!"

3721, "Viel Glück, Piloten!"

3722, "Die Soyakaze ist jetzt auf Position."

3723, "Wir erleiden schwere Treffer, Piloten! Schalten Sie diese Strahlkanonen aus!"

3724, "Gegnerische Bomber haben uns schwere Schäden zugefügt. Schalten Sie sie jetzt aus, Piloten!"

3725, "Die Hades reißt unsere Hülle auseinander! Zerstören Sie diese Strahlkanonen, Piloten oder wir werden es nicht schaffen!"

3726, "Wir nehmen schwere Schäden, Piloten! Fangen Sie diese Bomben ab oder wir werden es nicht schaffen!"

3727, "Die Hades ist bei fünfzig Prozent Hüllenintegrität. Setzen Sie Ihren Angriff fort, Piloten und achten Sie auf Ihre Staffelpiloten!"

3728, "Die Hades hat erhebliche Schäden erlitten. Setzen Sie ihr weiterhin stark zu, Piloten!"

3729, "Die Hades wird kritisch! Alle Einheiten, halten Sie Abstand!"

3730, "Gut gemacht, Piloten! Der GTI-Aufstand wurde besiegt! Kehren Sie für einen Heldenempfang zur Basis zurück!"

3731, "Mein Gott, wir haben die Soyakaze verloren!"

3732, "Piloten, Sie müssen die Hades um jeden Preis zerstören! Der GTI muss hier und jetzt aufgehalten werden!"

3733, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Alle Strahlkanonen die auf die Soyakaze gerichtet sind, wurden zerstört. Setzen Sie Ihren Angriff fort."

3734, "Die Hades setzt Bomber ein! Wir starten die Theta-Staffel zum Abfangen."

3735, "Hier ist General Amentep von der PVD Guardian. Verbündete terranische Schiffe, bitte Antworten."

3736, "Hier ist General Tess von der GTD Soyakaze. Ich grüße Sie, General. Mir war nicht bewusst, dass die Guardian bereits repariert wurde."

3737, "Bedauerlicherweise wurde sie das nicht. Wir sind immer noch im Orbit von Cygnus Prime. Aber lassen Sie uns auf das Protokoll verzichten, da die Zeit knapp ist. Liege ich in der Annahme richtig, dass Sie den GTI-Zerstörer Hades angegriffen haben?"

3738, "Bestätigt, General. Unsere Bomber greifen die Hades in der Nähe von Deneb III an."

3739, "Und so schließt sich der Kreis. Bemerkenswert. Ich möchte Sie darüber informieren, General, dass eines unserer Jägergeschwader einen $quoteHammer des Lichts$quote-Hinterhalt gegen die GTC Orff und zwei Bomberstaffeln abgewehrt hat."

3740, "Diese Schiffe sind in das Deneb-System eingeflogen in einem Versuch, die Hades anzugreifen, wurden allerdings offenbar mit falschen Informationen von einem Verräter versorgt, der mit dem GTI sympathisiert. Wenn Sie Ihre Koordinaten übermitteln, werde ich die Orff und ihre Staffeln zu Ihrem Standort neu einsetzen."

3741, "Übermitteln jetzt. General Amentep, Sie haben unsere aufrichtige Dankbarkeit."

3742, "Die Dankbarkeit liegt auch ganz bei uns, aber Sie können sie uns zurückzahlen, indem Sie die Geschichte Ihres Sieges über den GTI erzählen. Sa Terra, Schiffe der GTA. General Amentep Ende."

3743, "GTC Orff jetzt auf Position. Wir erfassen die Hades."

3744, "Heilige Scheiße, die Orff wurde abgeschossen! Sie hatte nicht einmal eine Chance!"

3745, "Die Orff wird heute gerächt, Pilot, wie jedes andere Opfer des GTI. Die Ehre, die Hades zu zerstören, muss an die GTA fallen, aber die Krieger der PVN werden alles tun, was sie können, um zu helfen."

3746, "Es ist schön, sie wiederzusehen, Orff. Ich mag Ihre neuen Freunde wirklich sehr."

3747, "Hier Iota 1. Wenn Sie die Jäger von uns fernhalten können, Piloten, werden wir die Juggernaut schneller ausschalten, als Sie blinzeln können."

3748, "Hier ist Pi 1. Die Ehre, die Hades zu zerstören, muss an die GTA fallen, aber die Krieger der PVN werden alles tun, was sie können, um zu helfen."

3749, "Oh, Verdammt ... Command, die Hades bewegt sich!"

3750, "Die Hades scheint ihre gesamte verbliebene Energie in ihre Hauptantriebe übertragen zu haben. Piloten, Sie müssen die Hades entweder deaktivieren oder zerstören, bevor Sie entkommen kann. Los!"

3751, "Die Hades springt raus!"

3752, "Verdammt nochmal, Piloten! ... In Ordnung, wir versuchen die Hades durch den Subraum zu verfolgen. Kehren Sie schnell zur Basis zurück und wir können Sie vielleicht an ihrem neuen Standort erneut einsetzen."

3753, "Wie wollen wir jemals dieses Ding zerstören? Es ist doppelt so groß, wie eine Orion und wahrscheinlich acht Mal so stark!"

3754, "Kämpfen Sie einfach weiter. Dies ist das gleiche, wie bei jeder anderen Sturmangriffsmission, auf der Sie waren, es wird nur einfach länger dauern. Bleiben Sie konzentriert. Die Hades fliegt nirgendwo hin."

3755, "Wir können von Glück reden, dass die Hope den Antriebsbereich getroffen hat. Je mehr Belastung, wir auf das Schiff legen können, desto besser. Ich vermute, dass diese integrierten terranisch-shivanischen Systeme nicht vollständig stabil funktionieren."

3756, "Ich glaube das nicht! Wir sind tatsächlich am Gewinnen!"

3757, "Werden Sie nicht unachtsam, Junge! Die Schlacht ist noch nicht vorbei."

3758, "Hier ist die Orff. Wir nehmen schweren Schaden, Piloten!"

3759, "Terranischer Spießrutenlauf"

3760, "Der Spieler durchfliegt den Spießrutenlauf gegen einen immer zunehmenden Rausch an Terranern. Aufregend, nicht wahr?"

3761, "Während Sie in der Lage waren, die erste Stufe der terranischen Gegner zu überleben, waren Sie nicht in der Lage, die Herausforderung zu meistern, die Ihnen durch die anderen Wellen gestellt wurde. Ihre Leistung war die, die wir von einem Anfänger direkt frisch von der Akademie erwarten würden."

3762, "Sie waren in der Lage zwei Stufen an terranischen Gegnern zu überleben, bevor Sie aus dem Spießrutenlauf abgeflogen sind. Für einen Reservepiloten der Allianz wäre dies eine gerade noch zufriedenstellende Leistung gewesen."

3763, "Sie haben drei Stufen an terranische Jäger erobert, bevor Sie eine Niederlage erlitten haben. Sie haben gut und ehrenvoll gekämpft. Wenn Ihnen jemals die Abenteuerlust packt, können Sie versuchen, alle Schiffe im Spießrutenlauf zu besiegen. Gut gemacht, Pilot!"

3764, "Sie haben fast den kompletten Spießrutenlauf geschafft, Pilot. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Nur sehr wenige Piloten werden je in der Lage sein, Ihre Leistung nachzuahmen. Wir werden auf jeden Fall unser Auge auf Sie halten, Pilot. Vielleicht ziehen Sie in Betracht irgendwann in der Zukunft die letzte Herausforderung dieses Spießrutenlaufs anzugehen. Wegtreten!"

3765, "Sie haben den Spießrutenlauf erfolgreich abgeschlossen, Pilot! Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Ihre Fähigkeiten schaffen Selbstvertrauen in Ihren Kolleginnen und Kollegen und in der gesamten Allianz. Gute Arbeit!"

3766, "Vasudanischer Spießrutenlauf"

3767, "Der Spieler durchfliegt den Spießrutenlauf gegen einen immer zunehmenden Rausch an Vasudanern."

3768, "Es wird 5 Wellen an vasudanischen Gegnern geben. Jede Welle wird aus 3 bis 6 Gruppen an gegnerischen Schiffen bestehen. Nach Abschluss der letzten Welle, haben Sie den Spießrutenlauf beendet. Gelingt Ihnen das, werden Sie ein gewisses Maß an Ehre innerhalb der Verteidigungsliga erhalten. Viel Glück, Pilot!"

3769, "Sie haben drei Stufen an vasudanische Jäger erobert, bevor Sie eine Niederlage erlitten haben. Sie haben gut und ehrenvoll gekämpft. Wenn Ihnen jemals die Abenteuerlust packt, können Sie versuchen, alle Schiffe im Spießrutenlauf zu besiegen. Gut gemacht, Pilot!"

3770, "Sie haben den Spießrutenlauf erfolgreich abgeschlossen, Pilot! Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Ihre Leistung war wirklich erstaunlich. Um Ihre Fähigkeiten als Jägerpilot anzuerkennen, wird Sie die Allianz in furchtbar riskante und gefährliche Kampfsituationen schicken. Ihre Fähigkeiten schaffen Selbstvertrauen in Ihren Kolleginnen und Kollegen und in der gesamten Allianz. Erneut, eine höchst ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot!"

3771, "Ihre Hülle kann nicht mehr viel mehr Schaden erleiden, Pilot. Wenn Sie wünschen, können Sie den Spießrutenlauf verlassen, ohne Angst zu haben, einen Ehrverlust zu erleiden."

3772, "Für Ihre ausgezeichnete bestätigte Abschussbilanz, haben Sie den Status des Asses erreicht."

3773, "Für Ihre hervorragende bestätigte Abschussbilanz haben Sie den Status des Doppel-Asses erreicht."

3774, "Für Ihre außergewöhnliche bestätigte Abschussbilanz haben Sie den Status des Dreifach-Asses erreicht."

3775, "Sie haben Ihr Offizierspatent für die PVN erhalten. Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Leutnant."

3776, "Aufgrund Ihrer Errungenschaften, Ihrem Charakter und Potenzial vergeben wir Ihnen ordnungsgemäß den Rang eines Oberleutnants."

3777, "Nach der Überprüfung Ihrer Dienstakte und den Empfehlungen Ihrer vorgesetzten Offiziere, hat die Militärdirektion Ihre Beförderung genehmigt. Herzlichen Glückwunsch Hauptmann."

3778, "Für Ihre hervorragenden Dienstnachweise, Ihrer Führung und Ihr Verhalten unter Feuer, haben Sie den Rang eines Majors erreicht."

3779, "Weil Ihre Errungenschaften Sie als Offizier auf höchstem Niveau auszeichnen, wurden Sie in den Rang eines Oberstleutnants befördert."

3780, "Für Ihre Brillanz als Pilot, Taktiker und Anführer verleiht Ihnen die Militärdirektion den Rang eines Obersts."

3781, "Oberst, Ihre lange und glanzvolle Dienstzeit zeichnet Sie als Anführer der Integrität, des Mutes und der Weisheit aus, weshalb Sie ordnungsgemäß zum Brigadegeneral befördert werden."

3782, "Im Namen der PVN-Militärdirektion und des Parlaments von Vasuda ist es meine Ehre, Ihnen den prestigeträchtigen Rang des Generalmajors zu verleihen. Herzlichen Glückwunsch."

3783, "Ihre Karriere steht als ein leuchtendes Beispiel für unsere Ideale und Werte und nur wenige Offiziere haben dem Imperium mehr Dienst geboten. Im Namen der PVN-Militärdirektion und des Parlaments von Vasuda verleihe ich Ihnen hiermit den prestigeträchtigen Rang des Generalleutnants."

3784, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch. Sie haben sich Ihren Platz in der höchsten Ebene der alliierten Führung verdient. Ihr Charakter, Mut und Genialität sind eine Inspiration für uns alle. Im Namen der PVN-Militärdirektion und des Parlaments von Vasuda verleihe ich Ihnen hiermit den prestigeträchtigen Rang des Generals. Jetzt gehen Sie und lesen Sie ein Buch."

3836, "Es gibt drei Subraumknoten in diesem System. Sie führen nach Vasuda, Aldebaran und Sirius. Zivilisten werden von Vasuda nach Aldebaran befördert."

3837, "Wegen der strategischen Bedeutung dieses Systems erwarten wir, dass die Shivaner versuchen werden, es schnell zu sichern. Sie sorgen für die sichere Passage aller alliierten Schiffe in dem Gebiet. Zusätzliche Befehle werden zu Ihnen gesendet, sobald sie entstehen."

3838, "Sie waren auch in der Lage das Gebiet zu sichern, bis wir eine stärkere Position im System aufgebaut haben. Gut gemacht!"

3839, "Sie waren auch nicht in der Lage das Gebiet gegen zukünftige shivanische Angriffe zu sichern. Es wird sehr schwierig sein, dieses System zurückzuerobern."

3840, "Was uns am meisten beeindruckt, ist jedoch Ihr Schutz für jedes einzelne Schiff. Wir haben keinen einzigen Frachter oder Transporter verloren und die Mecross ist vor shivanischen Bombern sicher.

Das ist wirklich eine erstaunliche Leistung und dafür erhalten Sie die Verdienstvolle Einheit."

3846, "Sie haben dabei versagt, die Hope zu beschützen. Auch wenn wir keinen Angriff von den Shivanern erwartet hatten, hätten Sie dieses Schiff schützen müssen! Wegen Ihres Versagens wird unser Einfluss in diesem System noch dünner. Wir alle müssen in diesem Krieg über unsere Fähigkeiten hinausgehen, Pilot. Wegtreten!"

3847, "$h Roter $h Alarm$| !

Für den fortlaufenden Dienst für die Allianz verleihen wir Ihnen den Orden für Gutes Verhalten. Machen Sie weiter so!"

3850, "Wir haben in der Schlacht auch viele Fluchtkapseln verloren. Solch ein Verlust von Leben ist schwer zu ertragen. Mehrere wichtige Wissenschaftler konnten nicht von der Installationsanlage evakuiert werden. Sie und ihre Forschungen werden schmerzlich vermisst werden."

3851, "Befehle zu verweigern und während der Schlacht abzufliegen ist unentschuldbar. Sie haben bis auf unbestimmte Zeit Flugverbot. Wegtreten!"
