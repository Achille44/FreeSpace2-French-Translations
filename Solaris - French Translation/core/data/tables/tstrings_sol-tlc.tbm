2479, "Great Powers"

2480, "The Miranda Accord of 2236 was signed into effect amongst the ashes of the Great War. The war was remarkable in the excesses of the tactics and weapons used, harkening back to the unrestrained industrial warfare of centuries ago. Unrestricted nuclear orbital bombardment had left several planets ecologically devastated, including Earth. By the time of ceasefire, billions of souls had perished. Humanity would not survive another such war.

A conference attended by representatives of every sovereign star nation set into motion a solemn, binding vow - never again will such destruction visit humanity's homes among the stars.

In addition to finalising the terms of armistice, a major tenet of the treaty was drafted to prevent a repeat of this tragedy by restricting the storage and deployment of spaceborne nuclear weapons to capital ships. Further treaty restrictions to nuclear proliferation limited capital ships to the three recognised Great Powers: the Atlantean Federation, Sinarus Combine and Alban Commonwealth. If any nation violated these restrictions, an automatic declaration of war by the three Great Powers would be enacted to enforce the treaty."

2481, "     Atlantean Federation"

2482, "'Liberty. Independence. Justice.'

The Atlantean Federation is a Great Power.

The Federation came into being as a military alliance of nation states to provide mutual defense against the authoritarian Combine. Mindful of the threat the monolithic Sol government represented, member states of the Atlantean Federation swiftly passed a constitution guaranteeing the political freedoms and autonomy of its systems.

A mosaic of varying cultures and political beliefs, the Federation covers a vast territory that includes several resource-rich systems. These critical resources helped support a massive wartime armament investment during the Great War. The fledgling alliance came out of the conflict with significant territorial and economic gains, overtaking every other rival to become the pre-eminent power in Terran space. However, the Federation strains under the tension of balancing member systems economic and political autonomy with the need for a centralised government to efficiently manage an increasingly hungry military budget.

The Federation has the largest military by tonnage of the Terran powers. A significant military industrial complex powers the Federation economy."

2483, "     Sinarus Combine"

2484, "'One people. One future.'

The Sinarus Combine is a Terran Great Power.

The Sinarus Combine rose from the ashes of the Sol Combine, the powerful administrative hub of Terran space. Economic and ecological collapse at the end of the Great War led to the replacement of Sol's government with a new capital in the Sinarus system. For the first time in human history, Earth had lost her place at the zenith of Terran administration and culture.

The following years were dark times for Combine citizens. The Sinarus government inherited a small but densely populated territory dependent on imports from outlying systems - systems now under Federation control. The loss of Earth's infrastructure and much of her population had also shattered the once-proud nation. The pragmatic but totalitarian ruling government took drastic action - entire swathes of the population were mobilised into rebuilding the economy. Power was concentrated at the upper echelons of the single-party government with severely curtailed political and social freedoms for its citizens. The nation's citizenry committed itself to this gargantuan task, firm in the belief that this was a necessary sacrifice to ensure a future for generations to come.

As a result, Combine leadership expects absolute loyalty to the state, including compulsory military service and working in a chosen area of a socially useful occupation. In return, Combine citizens have the right to comprehensive state welfare, housing and education.

As the economy recovered, the Sinarus Combine star fleet benefited from an extensive modernisation program. Heavily-armed warships are designed with less specialised roles than Federation equivalents with an emphasis on flexibility of movement and independent operations."

2485, "     Alban Commonwealth"

2486, "'For Crown and Country.'

The Alban Commonwealth is one of the Great Powers.

Fortune and foresight secured Commonwealth power. The capital system of Alba is the nexus of a densely populated hyperspace network, with extensive trading lanes established rapidly after the system was colonised. The Commonwealth's economy almost exclusively relies on trade, with Alban corporations maintaining some of the largest merchant navies in the galaxy.

During the final stages of the Great War, the Commonwealth took advantage of a unique opportunity to offer its services at mediation. In a diplomatic triumph, the Commonwealth arbitrated terms that satisfied both the Federation's territorial demands and the Combine's need to save face to its citizens. In 2236, the Alban Commonwealth chaired a conference attended by representatives from every independent star nation to draft the Miranda Accord. The prestige secured the recognition of the Commonwealth as a Great Power. Though not the military or industrial equal of the Federation or Combine, the Commonwealth still commands substantial economic and cultural power.

The Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the youthful Edward Wynson, a perspicacious and well-loved sovereign. Rumours circulate regarding House Wynson's ability to read and influence people, a trait shared by each generation of Wynson monarchs. This ability has taken on an almost mystical status from various embellishments over time.

Commonwealth military strengths lie in research and development, personnel training and naval intelligence. His Majesty's Navy is the smallest of the three Great Powers but emphasis on these strengths goes some way to offset the disadvantage in tonnage."

2487, "Middle Powers"

2488, "The central powers of the Combine and Federation dominate the heavily populated first colonies of humankind. Out in the anti-Spinward peripheries of the Orion arm, however, smaller powers jostle amongst each other for advantage. The rising power of the Alban Commonwealth acts as a tempering force, but the newly minted Great Power lacks the monolithic influence of the two premier powers in Terran space, and the primacy of its conventional military remains fragile."

2489, "     Republique Jacobine"

2490, "The Republique Jacobine is a Terran Middle Power.

An authoritarian parliamentary government born out of the rapid and tumultous colonisation throughout the Cygnus Reaches, a combination of shrewd economic management and military successes consolidated Jacobine power in the region. The Republique is an ambitious rising power convinced of it's place among the stars.

Decades of tensions with the Alban Commonwealth ended with the Pour Toujours Entente, signed in 2336 shortly after the nuclear destruction of Earth. This marked the beginning of forty years of scientific, military and economic cooperation between the two nations. Recent years have seen a concerted effort by the Jacobine and Alban Parliaments to create a bloc separate to the Sinarus and Atlantean behemoths. 

The La Marine is one of the most capable spacefaring navies in Terran space, operating a modern fleet of advanced warships. Recent territorial expansions and establishment of distant naval bases has increased the operational requirements of the Republican Navy."

2491, "     Greater Yamatan Union"

2492, "The Greater Yamatan Union ranks among the Middle Powers.

The vast regions of the Cygnan Wastelands belong to those strong enough to claim them. Militant and isolationist, the Yamatan people have embraced a mechanistic, materialistic worldview. The Yamatan Union routinely apply bioprosthetic enhancement technology to its citizens, with labourers and soldiers receiving particularly drastic augmentations. The psychological unease from outsiders regarding the extent of these modifications as well as condemnation over the sometimes brutal regimentation of Yamatan citizens has placed the Union at odds with other Cygnus Region nations. The Yamatan Union is particularly hostile towards the Alban Commonwealth, who it sees as undermining Union expansion and influence.

The Greater Yamatan Navy is the primary tool for advancing national interests in a nation with ambitions towards Great Power status with a conventional space military that rivals the Alban Commonwealth."

2493, "Non-State Actors"

2494, "Though hyperspace lanes provide natural points of interest and natural roads for expansion, the huge distances involved provide challenges for national governments to maintain the infrastructure required for effective and cohesive running of a state. 

When weaker nations are unable to provide security or maintain the loyalty of their populations, non-state armed groups such as citizen militias, criminal organisations and warlords develop as alternatives to governance by the state. These groups vary widely in capability and goals, but all contribute to the challenges faced by governing states in the 23rd century."

2495, "     Malika People's Militia"

2496, "The Malika People's Militia is officially classified as a Violent Non-State Actor.

The Fringe is a vast, sparsely populated region of space at the rimward edge of the Orion Arm, notable for an abundance of mineral resources. The Sulsian Hegemony had an iron grip on the major population centres, but corrupt bureaucracy and underdeveloped infrastructure allowed various militia groups in the region to flourish. Chief among these groups was the Malika People's Militia.

The Militia had an unassuming beginning after an armed rebellion on the asteroid mining hub Jotram Station in 2273. Already a precarious situation due to unsafe working conditions with minimal pay, the powder keg exploded when an engineering failure led to a loss of critical supplies and the deaths of several workers. Mercenary turned corsair Andri Gadaria diverted several captured supply ships to Jotram with the intention of winning over the worker population and create a new base of support. Gadaria's ruthlessness and charisma ensured his message of worker liberation propagated widely across Sulsia, making him a popular figure amongst indentured labourers.

The Malika People's Militia is a disparate coalition of paramilitary organisations, warbands and armed worker groups across Fringe space, whose armed forces are rapidly organising into a cohesive, coordinated institution. Supplied with powerful modern weapons by a mysterious benefactor, the Militia Navy has been able to challenge the Sulsian Hegemony for control of the resource-rich Fringe."

2497, "     Children of Renewal"

2498, "The frontiers of Terran Space are a region of intense religious activity. The absence of established institutions and an overwhelmingly practical worldview in a hardscrabble existence divested traditional religious organisations of authority. Ad-hoc spirituality took hold in the region, democratising religion and legitimised individual spiritual expression. Hardship and strong community ties formed the basis of this egalitarian landscape.

In the fertile ground of the Fringe, the Children of Renewal found a people primed to receive their message. The Renewal emphasis on the individual ability of a person to effect his or her own salvation resonated greatly. The message of charity and emphasis on personal development was especially popular with wealthy investors in the Federation, which provided finance for several major projects for expansion in the Fringe.

The Children of Renewal believe in salvation through charity and have several outreach programs throughout the Fringe. Flotillas of repair ships and supply transports crewed by volunteers are deployed to areas of need, all in the name of the Lord. A core belief of the Renewal is that the most important work is often the most difficult, which means Renewal ships are often found in disaster zones and contested regions thought too dangeorus for other organisations to operate."

2499, "Hyperspace"

2500, "In the late 22nd century, a revolution in space travel was accomplished. An alternative dimension of space-time, hyperspace was first postulated in wormhole theory. By tunneling between two points in 3-dimensional space, a vessel could practically achieve faster-than-light travel without the deterministic complications of actual FTL travel. The first hyperspace drives were cumbersome devices employing vast amounts of energy to fold two points in space and establish a hyperspace tunnel between them.

A second revolution came about through the detection of 'highways' connecting various points in real-space. Not only was the energy requirement far lower to 'enter' and 'exit' hyperspace at these points, travel time was significantly shorter than by the previous method of hyperspace travel. With the discovery of these hyperspace lanes, Terran colonisation of the Orion Arm accelerated at an exponential level. Whilst it is universally accepted that the presence of these lanes has been a boon to our species, the origin of these lanes remains a mystery. Are these lanes a natural byproduct of the hyperspace phenomenon, or were they artificially constructed by technology far in advance of ours?"

2764, "Welcome back Lieutenant Ross. You performed your mission to expectation. Unfortunately it didn't have the outcome we desired.

Federation Defense Intelligence were studying an alien relic. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Combine NavInt somehow found out about Federation experiments and used overwhelming military force to kick FDI out of Mira and steal their research data. The Combine superweapon at Morik was designed using alien technology. That ship we encountered at the artifact must have been Solaris given form.

Ideally we would have wanted to gain control of the artifact. The botched attempt by the Combine to destroy the artifact instead created an artificial hyperspace junction. The artifact is out of our reach - for now.

This is where we part ways. You're to transfer to the Athena effective immediately. Captain Fisher is aware and will make the necessary arrangements. She'll drop you off at the Akrotiri system, from there you can make your way back home. I've made the necessary amendments to your service record. You'll have a cover story to explain your absence to the relevant authorities regarding your Federation exchange tour. I'd lay low for the next few weeks just to be safe.

Lieutenant McKearney is accompanying you back home. We have no more need of her services.

Everything you've learned in the past 24 hours is classified Top Secret. We're dealing with advanced nonhuman technology that is beyond anything that our species has encountered or created. No one knows what this technology is fully capable of, but it won't stay secret for long. Before word gets out, we need get as much advantage as we can.

This artifact may be the factor that escalates this conflict beyond the Federation and Combine. This goes beyond old grudges, resources and national pride. The stakes have become too high. Everyone's now fighting for survival."

2850, "What the hell was that?"

2851, "My God...the artifact is powering up!"

2853, "We're in hyperspace!"

2854, "We're back in normal space. Astrogation, get us a fix on our location."

2855, "Commander, we're in the Gamma Vulpis system. Closest inhabited system is Zeichenfisch, fifty light years away."

2856, "Merlin, was that a nuclear EMP warhead?"

2857, "As I said, Lieutenant. The rules no longer apply."

2858, "Is that a black hole? Where the hell are we?"

2859, "Zeichenfisch? That's Rhenaric territory. We're five hundred light years away from Mira."

2860, "Nuclear detonations detected in proximity!"

2861, "They've seeded the artifact with warheads! That pulse must've been a detonation signal!"

2862, "The Combine wanted to deny us the artifact by destroying it. I don't think the activation was intentional."

2863, "What happened? How did we get here?"

2864, "Data analysis complete. The artifact absorbed the power output of the detonations and generated a localised hyperspace bubble."

2879, "Hi Stuart.

I'm happy with your flying ability. To be honest I'm just glad you're not one of those hacks hiding their lack of flight experience to get a job. The way you disabled those mines and the freighter means you're already light years ahead. I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Ferris is happy enough with how things turned out. Sulsian military security has identified the Stargazer freighter as the Samoyed. She's been implicated in 'salvage runs' throughout Sulsian space as well as laying mines for drone sabotage. I hear her crew's keeping tight-lipped. Let's see how long they can stay quiet.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. I hope this is the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Station master Ferris is furious that we lost that Stargazer freighter. We don't know who set the mines there nor who is responsible for the salvage operations. She's threatened to withhold our payment. I had to remind her that technically our mission was to clear the salvage field and find out what happened to her drones. She's grudgingly paid our completion fee, but I don't think she'll be offering us any more contracts at Overton.

I've used the funds to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. Things can only go up from here, so let's stay positive okay?

2881, "Mission successful.

Warship astrogation systems tend to be less protected than engine subsystems, so if the objective is to prevent a departure it may be quicker to destroy the astrogation subsystem than disabling the engines.

Sometimes the weapons available do not allow for efficient subsystem destruction. In this case destruction of the target becomes the only option."

Compass Rose arrived safely at her destination under the engine power of the Outreach. The executives at Trinity Holdings are delighted with the outcome and have thanked us for recovering the cargo. I hear the injured crew members are all doing okay.

In fact, I hear that Shafer has been fined a hefty amount and his master's license suspended. It seems the Sulsian Merchant Safety Authority wasn't impressed with the way he endangered his ship with that faulty impeller, citing several safety regulations that he breached. Nice to see a regulations agency with some teeth out here. Anywhere else, he'd have gotten away with it."

I'm not too familiar with the Malika People's Militia. All I know is they're a fringe group in conflict with the Sulsian Hegemony, and the closest thing they have to a leader is an ex-soldier called Andri Gadaria. His stated goals are the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination' whatever that means. Up until now they've been running mostly guerilla operations, and despite the Sulsian military's shortcomings, the group have been able to be contained. I've submitted a report of our encounter to the Sulsian Navy. Their threat assessment of the local militia groups needs updating.

I'm glad both of you are here with us. You keep performing the way you did, I think we'll do good out here."

3378, "That was tougher than I expected.

The Malikans were definitely behind the Korra mutiny. In fact, it's starting to look like they've been behind most of the uprisings in Sulsia.

This is a worrying escalation. Those transports were carrying troops to secure their hold on Korra, which means that they aren't just aiming to disrupt Sulsian operations. They plan to occupy assets and territory.

If I didn't know better, I'd say that Andri Gadaria is going beyond his goals of worker liberation. He's building an army.

Energence Industries has paid a bonus to the Hoshikuzu's crew for taking care of the Malikan reinforcements and keeping Navo's men safe. I'm using the extra credits to source some new equipment for the gunships. I'll get Kaur to go through the new cannons with you later."

Admiral Bertini's logistics ship Palos has finished going over our hull. Thankfully we didn't take any critical structural damage. The Hoshikuzu will continue to fight.

It looks like the assault on the Protogeneia was just the first move. Andri Gadaria's gone to war. There's reports of Malikan attacks throughout Sulsia and it's turning into chaos out there. All the trade cartels are pulling out and embassies are evacuating. Everyone's fleeing in fear of getting caught up in the war.

It's too dangerous for us to stay. Once the Hoshikuzu has finished repairs, I'm taking us out of Sulsia. I haven't decided where to take us yet. I'll ask around, see if I can find some safe harbour. I'll let you know soon."

The Albans are on their way home. The Hoshikuzu has also left the system with the Nassau. Master Badami reports the Hopewell's tow is still secure.

News reports aren't good. Malikan attack ships have swept through the system wiping out any Sulsian resistance they encounter. Kotus Anchorage has been occupied. The entire system is in lockdown.

The newsfeeds are buzzing with this development and speculating what other governments are going to do. The Albans have already shown that they can't protect their own citizens outside of Commonwealth borders. I'm not holding my breath that they'll do anything, they were the ones that helped bring about this mess by winding back all of their trade lane patrols. The Federation and Combine are too busy at each others' throats to care about what's going on here. No one else has a stake in what goes on in Sulsia.

I'm going to need a moment to process what just happened. Kendra and her crew are still held in remand under Colonel Navo and his soldiers. She was responsible for the deaths of dozens of Alban civilians when her ship destroyed the Elgin. By rights I should give her to the Commonwealth to answer for her crimes. I may end up doing that...but I need to talk to her first.

I've put us on a course to Vicare Station. The Pollux Arrow, Hopewell and the Nassau will join us for repairs and resupply.

This was supposed to be a simple escort mission in a remote location away from hostile territory. Not only did the Malikans know exactly where to find us, they went out of their way to hunt us down. To add to the disaster, the Pillar of Fire has been commandeered and we barely got away with her crew.

Reverend Lightowler's understandably distraught. I think he's more upset with the setback to the Promised Land journey than the loss of the survey ship. He's assured me that he doesn't blame us for what happened. He plans to take the surviving crew and rejoin the main Renewal congregation. We've been invited to join him.

I have no idea what technology the Malikans were using to mess up our astrogation calculations. At this point it shouldn't surprise me that a cobbled together armada of militia ships should somehow have technology that not even Great Powers have access to. Thankfully Erikson was able to isolate the source of the field. I owe her a drink at Vicare's rec room.

3711, "We're taking up escort positions alongside you. Fair sailing."

3712, "Lau, this is all an impressive spacescape but I don't really see any point to being out here."

3713, "Come on lad. All that means is you're showing a failure of imagination. Who knows what they could be hiding out here?"

3714, "Why don't you ask that survey ship Ross? I'm just here on a contract."

3715, "This doesn't seem like the sort of place any decent, rational person would willingly go."

3716, "Maybe this Lightowler bugger isn't a rational person."

3717, "Oh wouldn't that be perfect. Lau's got us out escorting a madman indulging his eccentricities."

3718, "I suppose you've got me curious now. Pillar of Fire, this is Lau on the Hoshikuzu. I'd be curious to know the reasons for your survey mission in the Veil."

3719, "This is Lightowler. We're heartened by your curiosity, Lau. I would be glad to indulge it."

3720, "You've come across our kind before. We serve the sick, the poor, the forgotten and the lost. Our aim is the betterment of humankind."

3721, "We see a world where we have forgotten who we are. Sons and daughters of a loving Lord, always and everywhere present to us."

3722, "Oh god. Why did you have to set him off Lau?"

3723, "Hush Ross. He's from the Children of Renewal. This is a chance to find out what these people are all about."

3724, "We serve those in need so that we may find ourselves as His people. It is the most difficult, but most important work we will ever do."

3725, "We seek salvation so that we may inherit the Lord's kingdom. Do you see where this is going Captain Lau?"

3726, "I think so. You think this...Lord's kingdom is somewhere in the Veil?"

3727, "Not quite. What we seek in the Veil is something different. The Lord has promised us a home to reside until the time is right."

3728, "Oh, I see. I guess you're searching for the...Promised Land?"

3729, "Eden. Arcadia. Shambhala. We've been searching for generations. First on Earth, then our Solar system, and now among the stars."

3730, "All the clues we've found point to this location as the most likely place. A fitting spacescape for our Gaia world."

3731, "Long range beacon away. Collating data from previous expeditions. We should be able to narrow down the location soon."

3732, "Oh my god. He's a madman."

3733, "I think that answers the question of whether he's rational."

3734, "How long will it take to find your Gaia world?"

3735, "This is the last survey mission. Our people are on the brink of realising their destiny. When we return to Covenant, we'll gather up the faithful and begin our pilgrimage."

3740, "Meiks, Ross. We need you for antiturret support when those corvettes get close. We got this, we just have to keep focused."

3741, "Did they follow us from Sulsia? How did they find us?"

3742, "Maybe someone on that Renewal ship sold us out."

3743, "Hoshikuzu, something's wrong with our astrogation systems. We can't plot a reliable course out of the Veil. Can you confirm?"

3744, "Something's wrong over here too. It's as though our systems can't navigate the gravity well. The values keep fluctuating."

3745, "Incoming fighters! They're being backed up by strike corvettes."

3746, "Gunships, take some pressure off us by disarming those corvettes."

3747, "Here come the missile corvettes! Remember your flares lad."

3748, "Captain Lau, we've got a problem. Main power is out. There's been a detonation in the reactor room. "

3749, "What? How did it happen? Can you bring your reactor back online?"

3750, "The entire reactor room has been compromised. The damage is too extensive for field repairs."

3751, "I'm making the call to abandon ship. Hoshikuzu, we need you to cover our evacuation."

3752, "Lau, the Malikans don't want to destroy the Renewal ship. They want to disable it, and capture it with those troop transports!"

3753, "I think you're right. Someone led the Malikans here. Probably the same person who sabotaged the Pillar's engines."

3754, "Lau, I've found the source of the gravity anomalies. That Malikan science ship is sending out gravity pulses. They're confusing our astrogation plotters."

3755, "Good work Erikson. Ross, that's your target. Assault the Vehemence and try to disrupt that gravity generator."

3756, "Captain Lau, this is Lightowler. My crew are in the auxiliary transports. We're commencing detachment from the Pillar."

3757, "Reactor down! Did that work Lau?"

3758, "Good work Ross. That seems to have done the trick. Plotting course out of the Veil."

I thought it would be the Malikans. I was hoping to take a few weeks out at Vicare, maybe help with the evacuation effort and run a few convoy escorts. Turns out there was an even bigger war out there and it's now arrived here.

Long range sensors are picking up Combine ships moving towards Sulsian space and more Federation ships have arrived at Vicare Station. Battlecruisers, frigates and cruisers, it's going to get crowded here very soon and the refugees are going to get caught right in the middle.

Reverend Lightowler's preparing the Renewal and refugee ships to leave Vicare. I've let him know my intentions of doing the same. Once all the refugees are off Vicare Station and onto the transports, we leave."

3806, "Instead of complaining about the ordnance you've got, how about I show you how to make them more effective?"

3808, "But what if there's a lot of turrets and you're on a time limit? Take out the weapons subsystem, you neuter them all."

3809, "Give me a moment to neutralise the weapons. Take the opportunity to rearm if you need to."

3814, "It's complicated. There's just too much history between us Ross. What would you do, if it was your family?"

3815, "I don't know. I guess I'm lucky. My family's not great but they're not actively trying to kill me."

3816, "Not great huh? I take it that's more of your Commonwealth understatement?"

3817, "My home was a glorified tuber farm in a fringe system. I was...the only one in my family that didn't find it a fascinating place. "

3818, "Wow Ross. A tuber farm?"

3819, "Lau. I'm trying to tell you something here. This isn't easy for me."

3820, "As one of his closest friends, I can confirm. This is a rare moment Lau."

3821, "I'm sorry. I wasn't laughing at you Ross. To be honest I'm honoured you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Have you told anyone else your story?"

3822, "Not really. There was...a friend of mine who did ask. I'm afraid I wasn't a very good friend to her."

3823, "It's nice to have actual firepower for once. Jackhammers are still crap, but better than nothing I guess."

3824, "I think joining up with the Hopewell and Navo was the best idea Lau's ever had."

3825, "You're welcome guys. It's a crazy universe out there and we need to take care of each other."

3826, "I grew up in a family of physicians Lau. It was the most restrictive home environment you can imagine."

3827, "Have you scheduled any more weapons practice for us?"

3828, "That's it for now. We should log this with the Sulsian garrison, in case they come up with jobs for us later."

3829, "I can register our group as qualified for anti-capship strikes. We'll be in high demand after this."

3830, "You take the lead Ross. Head over to the garrison HQ and we'll go from there."

3831, "Well maybe you should tell her too, the next time you see her. I'm also happy to hear the rest of your story, when you were ready."

3832, "Uh oh. This looks like trouble."

3833, "This is Captain Oberthur on the Thanatos, Federation Second Fleet. We are on a mission to maintain security at Vicare Station. Prepare to receive our vessel."

3834, "This is Commander Lutzhorn, Sulsian garrison. This is an illegal trespass. Our government has not authorised the deployment of Atlantean ships in our space."

3836, "All ships are warned to maintain distance from the Thanatos, or we will consider you to have hostile intent."

3837, "Ross, this looks bad. Get back to the Hopewell immediately. Keep away from that Atlantean warship."

3838, "Be advised our government has no wish to infringe on the sovereignty of this station. We seek only to dissuade the Sinarus government from occupying this territory."

3839, "This is an invasion of Sulsian space! Our government will hear of this Captain. You won't get away with this."

3840, "Your government will thank us later when Vicare remains under Sulsian control. The Combine will not be as accommodating when they arrive Commander Lutzhorn. "

3841, "Ross, get the hell away from that battlecruiser! I'm not going down because of this."

3842, "Ross! Get back to the Hopewell!"

3843, "Though I don't really go out that much. I don't take to the high-g cocktail as well as other pilots do."

Today is giving me the worst headache. My two contract pilots turn out to be Alban navy officers. I don't know what to do with this information.

What you did out there today Ross was...incredible. I don't think we could have made it without you. You proved your initiative and leadership ability when you took command of the fighter wings.

That being said, this complicates things. Not only am I your employer, while you remain a member of the Hoshi's crew I'm also your captain. I was put in command of the fighter group because the Hopewell's pilots knew who I was and were willing to follow my orders. They don't know you Ross, I had to urge them to follow your orders over private comms. This really isn't good enough. This isn't the military but hierarchy still means something in this unit. We need to come up with a better way to establish who's in command. 

Now that I know you've got military command experience Ross I'm more comfortable to give you more autonomy. I just wish you'd told me sooner, not when we're under attack by a Combine rear admiral."

3850, "Rear admirals. Speaking of which. The Combine have occupied Vicare station. The entire system is in lockdown.

And the whole thing only got a passing mention in the news. No story of Kakotchka attacking civilians, no mention of how an entire system got annexed. Just a statement from the Combine how they're there to 'stabilise the growing regional unrest'. Kakotchka should be put to court for war crimes, but like that's ever going to happen. Everyone's too caught up in the new Great War, no one cares what happens out in the fringe.

4001, "I remember now...there was a report on CBN. Fleet wanted a ship at Covenant to monitor the situation. Just in case the refugee train decided to make its way to Commonwealth space."

4002, "They sent a warship to watch over a refugee convoy? Just in case they decided to seek asylum in Commonwealth space?"

4003, "I don't know the specifics Lau. Fleet doesn't tell me anything. I get my news from CBN."

4004, "Sulsian convoy, this is HMS Aria of the Crown Navy. What is the status of the Alban diplomatic personnel?"

4005, "This is Corazon Hayburn. Alban citizens are on board the main Renewal transport ship. I am in talks with the ship's master to facilitate our transfer to the Rondeau."

4006, "Acknowledged Ambassador. We await your confirmation. Please ensure all citizens have identification on hand at time of transfer."

4007, "Why are they only picking up Alban citizens? There's room for everyone on that auxiliary ship. They could save everyone."

4008, "Because they're Commonwealth citizens Lau. The Commonwealth doesn't have the resources to save everyone. Might as well ask that auxiliary ship to pick up every refugee in Covenant."

4009, "Don't worry Lau. The refugees will be ok."

4010, "Lau. There's been a development. Your cousin Kendra wants to speak to you."

4011, "What? Why? Get her on a secure channel, beam it to my comms."

4012, "What do you think that's all about?"

4013, "I've got a hunch it's related to that Combine admiral that attacked the refugee convoy. Kendra's got to be connected to her somehow."

4014, "That Kakotchka must have been pretty desperate. She was bloody damned close to crossing a big red line, attacking civilians like that."

4015, "Wouldn't surprise me if she was the same person who hired Kendra Lau to attack the Elgin and the other Commonwealth transports."

4016, "You think we're about to hear a confession from Kendra?"

4017, "Probably. There's a Commonwealth ship here ready to receive her. She's thinking she'll get off lightly if she spills her guts before we hand her over."

4018, "Interesting if it's true. Someone from ANI probably uncovered some big secret of Kakotchka's. No wonder she's panicking, locking down Sulsia."

4019, "If it turns out to be the Combine that's responsible for destroying Commonwealth transports, that's going to be taken as a declaration of war."

4020, "So you're saying the Commonwealth doesn't have the resources to  transport a few refugees? Your so-called $quoteGreat Power$quote?"

4021, "War's inevitable Meiks. Romanowska saw to that when she nuked Morik."

4022, "Sulsian fighters, this is Commander Cameron, HMS Aria. We have a situation that needs your cooperation."

4023, "This is Katherine Lau. We'll cooperate, but are currently employed by the Children of Renewal. You'll have to run it past them."

4024, "Reverend Frances on Covenant has nominated your wing specifically, Katherine Lau. "

4025, "Then I suppose we're at your service. What's the situation?"

4026, "Our sensors detected a heat spike on one of the freighters around Covenant. It may be a tritium leak from their fusion reactor but we need to confirm this and offer assistance if required."

4027, "If the ship has an unstable reactor, it could pose an explosive hazard to the surrounding ships in the convoy."

4028, "Have you tried contacting the freighter's master?"

4029, "Yes. All we're getting is an autogenerated message citing comms failure."

4030, "We're sending you the transponder of the freighter in question. We need an active scan of the cargo and the ship's comms subsystem to confirm her distress."

4031, "Ross, can you go? Meiks and I will stay with the Gogoltha in case we're needed."

4032, "Aria, Alfa 1 off Hopewell. Cargo painted. I see the tritium leak, but it's from the cargo box, not the ship's reactor."

4033, "Aria copies, Alfa 1. This is concerning. Scan the comms subsystem of the freighter."

4034, "Aria, Alfa 1. I've run a remote diagnostic on that freighter. Her transceiver is in full working condition."

4035, "Alfa 1, Aria Actual. Copy scan findings. This is concerning. The freighter may actually pose a threat to the convoy."

4036, "We've got movement! The freighter's burning towards the Sulsian refugee convoy!"

4037, "Commander! We've picked up antimatter catalysers inside that freighter's cargo manifest. Yields suggest planet-killer nuclear warheads."

4038, "This is Commander Anil Cameron of the HMS Aria to all ships in the vicinity. We have identified a radiological threat to Covenant and her attending ships. Make best speed to a distance of five klicks from the specified freighter."

4039, "WARNING: RADIOLOGICAL THREAT"

4040, "Oh shit!"

4041, "Shoot that freighter down Ross! They're suicide bombers on a mission to take out the Sulsian refugees."

4042, "Belay that lad! That's a planet cracker! It'll have at least a five kilometre radius. If that cargo container gets hit, it could detonate the warhead."

4043, "The freighter crew is going to detonate that warhead anyway! We have to take the chance!"

4044, "This is transport Remembering Gogoltha. We have two thousand souls aboard. Please help us!"

4045, "The warhead has gone active! Reading a sustained nuclear chain reaction on the freighter."

4046, "Lau, get yourself and Meiks clear of the blast radius! Every ship needs to scatter now! "

4047, "We're not leaving these refugees to die!"

4048, "Oh my god! It's heading straight for the Gogoltha."

4049, "Katherine Lau. The freighter is closing in on the Gogoltha. You've done all you can. Get your ships clear."

4050, "I'm...sorry Reverend. I'm sorry your people weren't able to see their Promised Land."

4051, "We wouldn't have got this far without you, Katherine. We may be lost, but Covenant and her people still need you. Bring them to salvation, in our memory."

4052, "God damn it."

4053, "We're not giving up now. Not after coming so far."

4054, "The Lord teaches us that the most important roads are often the most difficult. This is not a failure Katherine Lau. It is a test for our people, one that we will overcome."

4055, "Sulsian convoy. Be advised we may have identified a bypass for the warhead's detonation trigger. Continue to make distance from the freighter. Alfa 1, we need further assistance."

4056, "Say again Aria? Have you found a way to deactivate the warhead?"

4057, "Your scan helped pinpoint the freighter's transmitting frequencies to the nuclear warhead. We may be able to repurpose the warhead's receiver."

4058, "If you scan the rest of the freighter's subsystems, we'll be able to pin down exactly how the warhead's detonation trigger is linked to the freighter's systems and bypass them altogether."

4059, "That'll do it. Tactical, bypass the trigger for the warhead's arming sequence. It won't stop a contact detonation but it's a start."

4060, "Helm, maintain a tight formation to the freighter. That bypass is on a tightrope. If we lose signal integrity at any time, we're done for."

4061, "We've bought some time. Alfa 1, take out the freighter's engines. Be careful, try not to damage the cargo."

4062, "Reverend Lightowler, you can rest easier now. The freighter's dead in space and the warhead detonation trigger has been disabled."

4063, "You did it Ross!"

4064, "Great work lad. Now what do we do with it?"

4065, "Navo, prepare the Pollux Arrow for a boarding mission. We should apprehend the crew for questioning."

The freighter's electronic manifest originates from Brenner, the Combine system where she allegedly collected the mining equipment. Usually the station commander signs off the shipment before departure is authorised, but this particular convoy was signed off by Rear Admiral Kakotchka herself.  

ANI is collating the data against what we already know of Kakotchka and a case will be made at the International Court of Justice. Crown Command has already authorised the deployment of a battle squadron to Sulsia to contest Kakotchka's annexation of Vicare Station. Rear Admiral Cleghorn on HMS Formidable will arrive in Sulsia in a few days.

I've signed off on the payment transfer to Katherine Lau's account. Your group did well enough out there. In particular I've made note of your competence in my report to Command. Your performance was instrumental in our success today, and I'll make sure your superiors know.

I'm taking the Aria to Ladigue station for resupply and service before heading back to our mission at Covenant. This is where we part ways. 

However, there's one more thing. As you know the Arrowhead corvettes have field maintenance facilities for an attending fighter. I would not be averse to having a pilot like yourself as part of my crew when you decide to return to full pay. Think about it, Lieutenant."

I think I understand Reverend Lightowler now. His Promised Land wasn't just a mythical land sustaining his religion, but a real place and a source of real power. He has something no one else in the galaxy has - a way to harness this alien technology. I don't know how he did what he did to those Malikan and Combine strike craft but it's chilling how one man can wield such power.

I don't know what happened to Covenant. I don't know if Kakotchka and Gadaria got to Lightowler or if he was able to make it out. I guess we'll never know.

Anyway, I want to thank you and Meiks for everything you've done for us. For the Hoshikuzu, for the Nassau and Hopewell, for Sulsia. I know this really wasn't what you signed up for, I never wanted to drag you guys through this. Sulsia's been my home for a long time now. I thought I owed it to this place to make things better.

I don't know what happened to you before you came out here Ross. I just want you to know that you've done good out here and made a difference. I'm forwarding your share of Lightowler's final payment. You guys earned it.

4642, "Lieutenant McKearney. Lieutenant Ross. Watch the space, the flight deck is a mess right now.

Captain Lancaster, FNS Longview. I'm sorry for your loss. The Artemis was a fine ship, and her reputation was well known. One more casualty of the Combine war machine.

Fifth fleet has been pulverised by the Combine. I lead what little is left. The Combine have initiated a full scale invasion of Morik and we're continuing the fight as best as we can. It's a real mess out here.

I've authorised your transfer to the Longview. Any assistance you two could give would be greatly appreciated. The Longview's air wing is critically short of equipment and personnel and two experienced pilots like yourself would make a world of difference.

Get some rest in the meantime. Use what time you have to grieve. I'll call on you when I need you."

4727, "Lieutenant Ross, this is an excellent outcome. Our crews have secured a trove of ammunition, spare parts and military equipment. Our operational capability has increased by an order of magnitude. We took a gamble but managed to pull it off. With the destruction of the Venturous and Stella Polare, more strain will be placed on Romanowska's remaining forces in Morik.

Fifteen minutes ago, nuclear bombers flying off the carrier Imperatrix glassed Juliet Base. Our ships had already secured all the supplies we could and took no further losses, but the base is now a tomb.

I'll have my analysts decrypt the data from the Combine base at Mira. There is high-level encryption in the native data, but the algorithm is one that Federation Defense Intelligence uses. We don't have the clearance codes necessary, and will have to locate a counter-algorithm before we can read the data. What we've found only raises more questions about the nature of the Mira base, and what the Combine were doing there.

As well as supplies, the Juliet hangars also contained Phantom-class stealth fighters in spaceworthy condition. With some minor maintenance they've been made mission ready and should be available for deployment at the next sortie.
"

4728, "Unfortunately, the mission did not go as smoothly as I'd liked. With no heavy firepower to bear against the Combine warships, Zeta wing were deployed for an assault. Though this mission was of critical importance, I would have preferred not to expose these LACS to enemy fire. Our resources are meagre enough as it is."

4729, "The main threats to the Uriel transport are the Combine light fighters. Make sure you intercept them in time to protect the lightly-armoured transport."

We're left in a difficult position. The Osiris is the last survivor of Task Force 57 and the Federation has suffered defeats not only in Morik but along the entire front. Our position here has become a lot more precarious.

What happens next will be up to Admiral Colvin. I will be boarding the Osiris to formally transfer command of Fifth Fleet and debrief on events in Morik.

Your mission is complete, McKearney. Pace will debrief you. The decrypted Juliet base data gives us the last clue that we need, a set of coordinates where we can find the source of the Federation's - now Combine's - superweapon. Your performance has been commendable and I'll note as such in your file - strictly off-record, of course.

We've spent the last two years chasing the greatest threat the Commonwealth ever faced. To be frank, it's nothing less than Armageddon. Bombing Earth in the last war wasn't enough for the Atlanteans. Now it seems their own weapon's been turned against them. Unlucky sods.

We've uncovered a diplomatic nest of snakes, but the politicos at home can sort that out. Our job from here is to find out what the Combine stole from the Federation, and how we can stop it.

The Merlin's going to Mira. The Combine base which your Artemis assaulted was a secret Federation research facility that the Combine commandeered several weeks ago. The Artemis assault was FDI covering their own backsides. Something's in that system that the Federation wanted to keep hidden, and I plan to find it.

Thank you for your assistance in giving us this breakthrough Lieutenant Ross. Be advised that everything you've learned today is classified. Once we're out of Morik I'll make plans to exfiltrate you off the Merlin."

5018, "Hi Stuart. Welcome to Sulsia. Thanks for applying for my job listing. I hear you've come all the way from the Alban Commonwealth."

5019, "I'm Katherine Lau, captain of the corvette Hoshikuzu. I'm putting together a crew for some contract work. I could use a good pilot."

5020, "Sulsia will be our area of operations. It's out in the fringes of colonised space but it's still a major trade hub. The Sulsian Hegemony exports a large number of mineral resources for manufacturing."

5021, "It's a huge frontier and the Sulsian navy's spread thin. Alban Commonwealth cruiser patrols used to keep order out here but with the war and all, they've all been pulled back home."

5022, "Now the trade corporations are having to fill the gaps left behind by hiring independents for security. This is a good opportunity to make some coin."

5023, "As far as I can tell your certifications look good enough, but I want to see your skills for myself. The Hoshikuzu's still undergoing upgrade work so I'm taking the opportunity to run a performance assessment."

5024, "I've accepted a contract on your behalf from Lupe Ferris, the Overton station master. A single pilot like yourself should be able to pull this off."

5025, "As you've probably seen on your way in, Overton Orbital is a graveyard for decommissioned ships. Station salvage drones comb the field for useful scrap which gets processed here and then sold on the market."

5026, "Ferris says several drones have been lost while on salvage missions - as in, more and more aren't returning to the station."

5027, "These drones work autonomously, they aren't tracked or kept in sensor contact. A lot of this is unavoidable, the debris creates a lot of signal noise."

5028, "The station sensors have also detected low-energy signals out in the field. The debris chunks are all inert, so there shouldn't be anything out there."

5029, "Ferris wants someone to go out and see what's generating those signals. If you can find out what's happening with the drones, that'll be a bonus too."

5030, "Your gunship is berthed in the station hangar. She's one of two custom-built craft."

5031, "They were both in pretty good condition when I found them in the Overton field, and with modifications they're tough little birds."

5032, "We might as well use the opportunity to see how well they fly with a pro at the stick."

5033, "So, that's your mission Ross. A little ghost-hunting to start off your time here. I'll talk to you again when you're out in the field."

5036, "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU"

5037, "Welcome aboard, newcomer! Please take a moment to read through this orientation guide to familiarise yourself with the Hoshikuzu and her crew."

5038, "The Hoshikuzu is a one-of-a-kind corvette that started life as a Rasputin-class transport before being sold for scrap."

5039, "She was salvaged and converted into an armed corvette by Katherine Lau, her current captain."

5040, "Her reactor and impeller was replaced with a military-grade unit, and her engines operate at more than two hundred percent efficiency. She is a hare with a lion's heart."

5041, "Along with her new 40mm chaingun PDCs, she carries two gunships and several repair drones for support."

5042, "Katherine Lau is the ship's captain. She decides who joins and leaves the ship. All who work hard are welcome. Those who misbehave are asked to leave."

5043, "Derek Kaur is the ship's mechanic and keeps the power running. He's a Great War veteran, and he loves only vodka more than machines."

5044, "Verma Erikson runs tactical and weapons. She's a mystery but no one knows guns better than her. If you manage to find out anything about her past, share it with me."

5045, "Dodo Meiks is one half of the gunship pilot team. He's a Caledonian through and through and is the only one that can match Kaur drink for drink."

5046, "Finally there's Stuart Ross, the other gunship jockey. He's a bit of a lone wolf, but you can always expect him to speak his mind."

5047, "I hope your time aboard the Hoshikuzu is a positive experience. If you have any questions about this orientation guide, just send over a comms."

5048, "DEREK KAUR - HOSHIKUZU"

5049, "Kaur"

5050, "Hello Ross. Derek Kaur, ship's engineer. I helped Lau outfit the Hoshikuzu with the new reactor."

5051, "As a reward Lau now has me running double duty on reactor and gunship maintenance. I'm in charge of keeping your craft maintained and repaired."

5052, "I don't know if Lau told you. I used to serve in the Sinarus Combine navy. I was a flight deck engineer on an aviation frigate during the Great War."

5053, "I also know relations between our nations are strained. It's no matter. Sinarus, Alban, on this ship all are brothers. Leave the politics to the politicians."

5054, "Your gunships are interesting machines. I've modified their weapon mounts to accept most weapon systems out there. That should increase their potential firepower."

5055, "Right now we are limited to basic equipment. I expect things will change when we get access to more advanced weapons."

5056, "That's all I wanted to say for now. I'll let you know once we get better equipment."

5057, "Hey Meiks, Ross. Look who's just scored our first contract?"

5058, "Our client is Trinity Holdings, a major trade cartel headquartered here at Azar station. They've posted out a contract to investigate a distress call from one of their freighters."

5059, "The call came from the Compass Rose, a cargo freighter enroute to the Multnomah system. She dropped out of hyperspace with an unspecified 'engine failure'."

5060, "The Compass Rose dropped out near several star systems with known pirate activity. She's a sitting duck for vultures looking for easy prey."

5061, "No details on what to expect, but the Hoshikuzu and your gunships should have more than enough firepower to deal with any raiders we're likely to encounter. Your gunships are fully stocked with kinetic rounds and missiles."

5062, "Our mission is to safeguard the Compass Rose and her cargo while rendering assistance to her crew."

5063, "This is going to be your first outing with us, so I'll go through the game plan once more before we head out."

5064, "Your gunships are too small to have their own hyperspace impeller, so you two will ride docked on the Hoshikuzu's fighter rails when we enter hyperspace."

5065, "Once we enter the area, undock your gunships from the Hoshikuzu to initiate flight operations."

5066, "You'll be weapons free after that. Watch your fire though, the Hoshikuzu may be armoured but I don't want her to take any more damage than she needs to."

5067, "That's all for now. If there's no questions, get to your gunships. We jump when you're confirmed secure."

5073, "As I've said before this region's been descending into a shitshow for a while, but this is the worst it's been."

5074, "Word around the trade cartels is that there's worsening unrest with industrial workers all around Sulsia. Something's got the roughnecks riled enough to drop tools. "

5075, "The Sulsian government's deployed the Navy to clamp down on trouble spots, but the unrest is escalating all around Sulsian space. They're spread thin trying to cover everywhere at once."

5076, "We're going to be spoilt for choice with security contracts, but if the situation gets too messy I'm bailing us out of Sulsia."

5077, "I'll never choose a job that forces us to do terrible things to innocent people. However anyone who doesn't feel like they can continue here is free to leave."

5078, "Everyone on this ship is a volunteer, and I'll support whatever decision you make."

5079, "I got us a new contract. We're on security duty again."

5080, "We're headed to Korra Station, a silicon refinery in orbit of Rubedo."

5081, "Twelve hours ago the refinery workers staged a coup and stormed the station's CnC."

5082, "Thankfully no one was killed, but the facility is now in lockdown and all silicon refining has halted."

5083, "The workers have pledged solidarity to the Malika People's Militia, but the group hasn't claimed responsibility."

5084, "The mining corporation Energence Industries has contracted a troop transport to assault and take back the station. Our job is to provide escort and eliminate all threats."

5085, "Two missile corvettes have taken up sentry positions near the station."

5086, "They're essentially converted transports and shouldn't pose much of a threat to the Hoshikuzu. However they'll need to be dealt with before the marines can start their assault."

5087, "Before the assault can commence the station reactor needs to be disabled. This will cut power to the station and shut off the gravity generator."

5088, "This is the plan. The Hoshikuzu and transport Pollux Arrow will jump in outside of missile range to the corvettes and hang back."

5089, "We've attached an EMP mine to your gunship. You'll need to drop it off in proximity to the station's reactor. This means running a gauntlet of the missile corvettes to the station."

5090, "Once in position, detach the mine and move out of the area. The mine has a thirty second timer before sending out a powerful pulse to disable the station's reactor."

5091, "Once the reactor is down, the Pollux Arrow will begin her assault and breach the station."

5092, "Our job is to provide area cover during this phase of the operation."

5093, "As far as we can tell, none of the mutineers on the station have magnetic boots. This puts them at a significant disadvantage."

5094, "This will hopefully minimise casualties on both sides and allow the station to be secured quickly."

5095, "I've checked with the Pollux Arrow and Energence Industries. This is to be a humane operation."

5096, "Energence Industries know that if things go badly here, it'll hit their bottom line. They're in full PR mode over this mess, and want this done clean."

5097, "I've got big news from the local feeds. The Motina Kometa crew just swore allegiance to Gadaria's Militia. They were the second largest Fringe group after the Malikans, and Gadaria's only remaining serious challengers."

5098, "The Malikans now have almost uncontested ownership of deep Fringe space, and enough military hardware to challenge the Sulsian Navy."

5099, "This is bad news. The only reason the Fringe groups hadn't overrun the Sulsian Navy before now is that they were competing with each other and disorganised enough to be suppressed piecemeal."

5100, "With the Fringe groups organised under one leader, the Sulsian government has upgraded the threat level to Severe. I'll keep a close eye out for more updates over the next few days."

5101, "KAUR"

5102, "Hello Ross. Lau's sourced some new cannons for you and Meiks. I've modded them compatible with your gunships' systems."

5103, "You've got the option of Maxim cannons now. They're Federation standard and fire solid flechettes instead of explosive-tipped rounds."

5104, "They're a little better at subsystem and turret penetration than the Huaqings but they don't do as much damage against soft targets."

5105, "Like the Huaqing the Maxim pods are modular so it's a quick job to swap them out. Just let me know ahead of time before we jump out."

5106, "Personally I don't care for them as much as the Huaqings but Lau says I'm just biased."

5107, "Ross, Meiks. This is probably a bad idea but we're doing it anyway. We've picked up a distress call from the Sulsian warship Protogeneia."

5108, "It looks like the Malikan militia's pulled off something big. They've ambushed the flagship of the Sulsian Navy, hit her reactor and left her adrift."

5109, "The Malikan warship Opus is bombarding the Protogeneia from range. Her capabilities are unknown, but she's bigger than the corvettes we've come up against previously."

5110, "The Hoshikuzu is the closest ship that can help. I'm bringing her in."

5111, "We're going in without much info but here's the best plan I've got."

5112, "Undock from the Hoshikuzu and move to defend the Protogeneia from incoming missiles. The Hoshikuzu will move to take up a defensive position alongside the battlecruiser."

5113, "We're going to try and buy time for the battlecruiser to restore power to her systems. The Opus is a lot bigger than we are and I don't plan to go near that ship."

5114, "The Protogeneia is a pre-Great War relic, but she's all brute and muscle. We just need to cover her while she restores power to her engines and weapons for a counter-attack."

5115, "I've been in contact with Latona waystation. Multiple Sulsian Navy ships are scrambling to assist, but none of them will arrive in time. We're likely be by ourselves during this engagement."

5116, "Everyone good? Ok. Let's go save some Sulsians."

; m15_vn.txt

5117, "Okay. I've had my ear to the ground listening to newsfeeds and contacts in the merchant guilds. The general gist is that short of military convoys, commerce in Sulsian space is no longer feasible."

5118, "One in four transports aren't making it to their destinations. The Albans have withdrawn all of their convoy escorts for fleet duty. Same with the Jacobins, and the Rhenish."

5119, "The Sulsians are running out of ships. They don't have enough to cover the trade lanes and fight the Malikans at the same time."

5120, "I know it feels like we're abandoning Sulsia, but we're not equipped to fight a war. We'll have to come back when things settle down."

5121, "The Vicare system is looking like our best bet. It's the only supply hub in the region, so it's going to be a magnet for anyone fleeing the war zone."

5122, "Vicare is a border system, and it's the last port of call out of Sulsian space. Refugee and freight convoys have been gathering there over the past few days."

5123, "There'll be a chance to pick up a few escort jobs, and it's far enough away from the Malikan front that it's stable for now."

5124, "Something just came up. Ross has requested we divert to Kotus Anchorage, a Sulsian industrial hub. A large Malikan strike force is enroute and there's some civilians that need help."

5125, "Kotus is the site of an Alban Commonwealth embassy. The facility is evacuating its entire staff, and the transports need escorting out of the area."

5126, "They've sent out a call for assistance to secure the evacuation against a likely Malikan attack."

5127, "The evacuation is being hampered by heavy crowds. Thousands of people at the Anchorage are trying to get out of the system."

5128, "The transports are short-ranged and don't have intersystem hyperspace impellers. The Alban Commonwealth has dispatched the heavy transport Elgin to a rendezvous point in the system."

5129, "Other evacuations are taking place elsewhere in the system. The Elgin will be taking on passengers from these operations as well."

5130, "I know we've already made the decision to leave, so I wanted to run it past everyone first. Do we leave Sulsia now or do we help these Alban civilians first?"

5131, "All right. I guess that's decided. I'll let Kotus know we're on the way."

5152, "I didn't ask for my parents to leave or for me to live with your broken family."

5153, "Maybe I am stupid. Maybe I should drop you out the airlock right now so you never get the chance to attack me and mine again."

5154, "I owe it to my crew. We don't need this albatross around our necks."

5155, "You think I'm the only danger to your crew Katherine? Wake up. You've made a lot of enemies out there, it's only a matter of time."

5156, "I'll deal with them when the time comes. We're done here. You can spend another three days waiting for me to decide what to do with you."

5157, "Ross, I've got good news. Master Badami of the logistics ship Hopewell has contacted me with an interesting project."

5158, "I don't know the full details, but it looks like the Hopewell is in the process of being converted into a light carrier. Vicare yards have already started the workup."

5159, "Master Badami has asked me to help train the crew in strikecraft maintenance. In return he's loaned us two Warden fighters from the Hopewell's strikecraft complement."

5160, "If you're not familiar with Wardens, they are decent heavy fighters. They're cannons only, but are a lot more agile than the Comet missile gunships."

5161, "The only issue is the guns overheat with prolonged fire. However, if you time your fire right they can do a lot of damage to anything in front of them."

5162, "Like the gunships, I've modified them to accept modular primary cannon banks. You'll be able to fit one bank of light kinetics and one bank of medium cannons."

5163, "I've kept them in storage in the Vicare Station hangars alongside your gunships, but we should be able to bring them along to the Hoshi's next sortie."

5164, "As usual, let me know ahead of time so I can make the necessary arrangements."

5165, "If you need to find me, I'll be on the Hopewell running deck training. See you soon."

5166, "Looks like our reputation precedes us. I've been approached by Reverend Lightowler of the survey vessel Pillar of Fire. He's been running the Children of Renewal operations here at Vicare."

5167, "Lightowler wants an escort for a mission out near the edge of the Pallavian Veil. If you're not familiar with the Veil, the closest border is at least twenty light years from here."

5168, "So it's definitely not a small journey, but we've got the time. The Hoshikuzu is fully repaired but the Vicare yards report Nassau will still need at least a week."

5169, "I'm not sure if you've ever been there. It's a huge multisystem nebula around a star cluster. The radiation and gravity makes it a volatile area of space."

5170, "It's a long way away from colonised space and far out of the way of major transit lanes. I'm not expecting any trouble, but I wouldn't want to sail through the Veil without a good astrogation suite."

5171, "I haven't seen any ship like the Pillar of Fire before. She looks...pretty unique. Her master assures me that her astro equipment is up to specification."

5172, "I don't know what Lightowler plans to do out in the Veil, but it seems like an easy enough job. The Renewal are planning to take the Sulsian refugees to the Covenant system in a few days to meet up with their congregation."

5173, "Lightowler wants the survey mission finished before they move out. He seemed to think this part was important."

5176, "It's official. Navo, Master Badami and I have joined forces. The Hoshikuzu, Pollux Arrow, Nassau and Hopewell now fly together as a team."

5177, "Considering we've previously worked closely with Navo and his marines, as well as Kaur working with the Hopewell's deck crew, this is probably all just a natural evolution of our relationship."

5178, "As part of the merge, Badami and Navo have agreed to give us access to their finances."

5179, "I've used a portion of our funds to refurbish the Hoshikuzu. The work will be done at Vicare station. With the Hopewell also being converted to a carrier, our group will be using almost all of Vicare's total yard capacity."

5180, "The Hoshi's going to be a whole new ship at the end of the refurbishment. Her drone bay and fighter maintenance facilities are being replaced with an ASM launcher."

5181, "This is a massive investment which I hope will pay off in the end. She's finally getting some teeth to match her lion's heart."

5182, "This means Ross and Meiks are moving out. The gunships will be transferred to the Hopewell's fighterbay along with both pilots. I'm sure you'll all be sad to see them go."

5183, "However, both Meiks and Ross will remain under my employment as part of the Hoshi's official roster. I'm not letting you two get away that easily."

5184, "Got a surprise for you Ross. I had some leftover funds after the Hoshi's refurbishment so I went shopping at Vicare."

5185, "The Hopewell is the proud home of two Tor bombers that I got for a bargain, along with a supply of Jackhammer anti-ship missiles. They'll make up the Hopewell's heavy strike wing."

5186, "I want us to take one out for a test drive. We'll also use the opportunity to try out the Jackhammers."

5187, "You, Meiks and I are taking a shuttle out to the Hopewell. From there we'll launch from the hangar and start the weapons test. I've got a test site set up in the nearby scrap field."

5188, "Obviously the Tor bomber is a lot heavier than your Comet gunship and even more sluggish. Today I want you to get a feel for how it flies in case you need to use it in the future."

5199, "I suppose we've got some good people with us. Navo will be running ops on the Nassau. Kaur is itching to try out the Hoshi's weapons upgrades. And we've still got you and Meiks out there to save the day."

5200, "If there's anyone that can get through the storm that's about to hit, I suppose it'll be us right? We've been through some rough spots before this. If we're still here it means we're doing something right."

5201, "If our time comes maybe the karma we'll earn for helping these refugees might even count for something."

5202, "Sorry Ross. Been feeling philosophical nowadays what with everything. I wasn't expecting any of this when I decided to go into merc work."

5203, "I suppose I'm procrastinating having to confront my cousin again. I've decided to hand her over to the Commonwealth, have her answer for what she did at Kotus Anchorage."

5204, "Once we deliver these refugees to the Children of Renewal, we'll find the nearest Commonwealth port and give Kendra to the Albans. It's the right thing to do."

5205, "Do you think I'm being too optimistic, planning too far ahead? Sometimes it's hard to look ahead what with all the things going on right now."

5206, "But we've got to somehow, don't we? Life goes on around us even when everything seems overwhelming."

5207, "Well, looks like work calls. The waystation sensor reports have arrived. I'll send the word when we're ready to launch."

5209, "Looks like everyone's tuned in. Okay, let's start. Here's the situation."

5210, "Latona Waystation has reported Combine warships heading directly for Vicare station. They will arrive within the half-hour. We've run out of time."

5211, "The composition of the attacking force is hard to pin down, but the strength of their impeller signals suggest a battlecruiser task group at least."

5212, "Captain Oberthur has placed the Thanatos and her escorts at full combat alertness. The Atlantean Federation warships will occupy the Combine task force while the refugee transports clear Vicare station."

5213, "The Nassau and Hoshikuzu are not expected to fight the Combine ships, but are to stay with the convoy to screen against skirmishers."

5214, "I'm pretty damned glad. I don't fancy my chances against a Combine battlecruiser. Let the Federation fight the war, that's supposed to be what they do best right?"

5215, "While the Thanatos and her ships keep the Combine busy, the convoy will move to clear Vicare Station. Once at safe distance, the transports will jump out to rendezvous with the Renewal congregation."

5216, "For our pilots who haven't met Meiks and Ross, they're the two gunship pros from the Hoshikuzu. They'll be Alfa wing. Captain Lau is Bravo 1. Keep an ear out for her instructions and follow her target calls."

5217, "Everyone else will be distributed among Bravo and Charlie wings."

5218, "Okay. Captain Lau, Master Badami. Anything else to add? Good. Everyone has their role. Let's get out there and bring these refugees to safety."

5223, "The loss of the Elgin was tragic but our embassy in Sulsia managed to evacuate with minimal casualties."

5224, "This attack on Commonwealth citizens wasn't a random Malikan raid. I'm afraid I must take partial responsibility."

5225, "Well-armed and well-resourced groups are after me, and unfortunately Commonwealth citizens were caught in the crossfire. When one can't find one's target, carpet bomb the ground around them and to hell with collateral damage."

5226, "I've come into information that certain powerful high-ups don't want released. Something to do with the Malikans' newfound capacity for war. As bad as the Sulsians are at keeping their own territory secure, they're not entirely to blame."

5227, "I was sent to find out who was supplying Andri Gadaria with weapons. The Malikans are a pawn in a greater game. We're now starting to find out who the players are."

5234, "I've been there before. The Children of Renewal are good people. The refugees will be well looked after."

5235, "Our job will be done once we arrive in Covenant. Once our payment comes through, I plan to find a Commonwealth port to drop off Kendra."

5236, "The Nassau, Hopewell and Pollux Arrow are free to pick up extra contracts at Covenant to pay for running costs."

5237, "Thanks Lau. We should be fine for a while. The bonus pay promised by Reverend Lightowler is substantial. Almost unexpectedly so."

5238, "Interesting. I get the feeling Lightowler's free with his credits because he doesn't see a need for them anymore."

5239, "The Children of Renewal must be planning something big."

5240, "Good luck to them. In the meantime, we've decided Ross, Meiks and Lau will run escort during the final approach. Our fighters got shot up pretty bad during the escape from Vicare and several of our pilots are recuperating."

5241, "Ambassador Hayburn assures me he will negotiate transport for the Alban citizens and Lightowler will represent the rest of the Sulsian refugees."

5259, "President Fitzgerald has announced a deployment of a powerful naval strike force to the Elam Republic."

5260, "The war between the relatively minor powers of the Elam Republic and Qahtadnan Union continues to serve as a point of contention between the great powers of the Atlantean Federation and Sinarus Combine."

5261, "Combine military support for the Qahtadnan Union has been condemned by the Atlantean Federation as a destabilising force in the region."

5262, "However, the Alban Commonwealth Parliament on behalf of King Edward has cautioned the Atlantean Federation not to further escalate the conflict."

5265, "Ramly"

5266, "Orders just came through from Command. The Artemis will accompany Rear Admiral Akrami's dreadnought Colossus and her battlegroup to the Elam Republic. We will be Task Force 55."

5267, "The Artemis will be stationed at Durius, one of the Republic's major mining systems. There have been increasing incursions from Qahtadnan forces in the past week."

5268, "Federation Defense Intelligence believes that Qahtadnan belligerence has been encouraged by Combine military and logistical support."

5269, "Our mission is to provide counter-assistance on the side of the Elam Republic. We can expect to take part in combat operations."

5270, "The Atlantean Federation has not declared hostilities against the Sinarus Combine. However any Combine forces identified in Durius are to be assumed hostile."

5271, "We're to do whatever's necessary to secure Elam citizens and infrastructure."

5272, "The majority of Task Force 55 will be concentrated at the capital system of Akkad. However, additional assets will be sent to Durius as needed."

5276, "Lieutenant Ross. You the new Alban exchange pilot? Cavill, wing leader. Callsign 'Ahab'. Welcome to the Artemis."

5277, "We're always happy to show Commonwealth pilots a thing or two about Federation service. 'Raptor' McKearney is another Commonwealth pilot here on exchange. You'll meet her later."

5278, "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings."

5279, "Artemis doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of a fleet carrier, but she's tough as nails with teeth to match."

5280, "She's got a reputation in Fifth Fleet as a brawler that gets shit done. Looks like she'll be sinking her teeth into some Qahtadnan misfits."

5281, "We're the only onboard squadron, a multirole combat unit flying Viper defenders and Hornet strikers. As the primary strike arm of Artemis, we'll be expected to interdict enemy strikecraft as well as support assaults against hostile warships."

5282, "Anyway, I'll keep this short as I expect you'll be wanting to settle in. I'll see you at 0800 hours tomorrow for your orientation."

5283, "Good morning pilots. It's been a long journey but the Artemis has finally arrived at Durius. We've taken up station at Durius Installation, the commercial and industrial hub of the system."

5284, "This area has been the site of several engagements between invading Qahtadnan forces and the Elam navy garrison."

5285, "The local sensor system has been compromised. Our first priority is to reestablish this network. When this is done we can begin combat operations in the system."

5286, "Ahab and Ross, you'll be flying escort for the Sina, an Elam navy corvette."

5287, "Sensor platforms have been loaded onto the corvette for deployment. If hostile forces attempt to impede, you are authorised to engage and neutralise them. Ensure the Sina does not get destroyed."

5288, "Once all the sensor pickets have been deployed, Beta wing will launch to fly CAP."

5289, "Intelligence on Qahtadnan force composition is sketchy, but you're likely to encounter M-21 'Cobra' light fighters and A-15 'Stalker' strikers. These craft are Great War relics and should be no match for your Vipers."

5293, "Hello Lieutenant. Crown Command has need of your skills. You will report to myself as your operations manager for the next mission."

5294, "Katherine Lau has accepted the terms of our contract of employment. I thought it prudent you receive a personalised briefing. You're still a King's Officer, half-pay leave or no."

5295, "First, a summary of the strategic situation and how it relates to our upcoming operation."

5296, "As you no doubt know, an unknown actor has been supplying the Malikans with high grade weapons, and setting them loose in Sulsia."

5297, "It's clear the intent must have been to cripple the Sulsian Hegemony, and as a result undermine Commonwealth interests in the sector."

5298, "We don't know exactly who's supplying them, but we believe high ranking officers within the Sinarus Combine are involved."

5299, "The consequences have been severe. The Sulsian navy has been brought to its knees, and thousands of civilians in Sulsia have died at the hands of Andri Gadaria's militia."

5300, "For his crimes against humanity, the Alban Commonwealth has answered the Sulsian Hegemony's call for assistance to bring Andri Gadaria to justice."

5301, "Crown Command has identified two short-term goals in the Sulsian theatre. First is to apprehend or neutralise Gadaria."

5302, "Second is to identify the individual responsible for arming Gadaria's terrorist group and gather evidence against them."

5303, "The Alban Parliament is building a coalition against the Sinarus Combine. The more evidence we can bring to the table, the more support we can gather and the better we can offset the Combine's military power."

5304, "When war comes to the Commonwealth, we'll need all the advantage we can get."

5305, "All right Ross, Meiks. Your former masters have hired us for an operation against the Sinarus Combine. I figure since we're already enemies with their rear admirals we might as well go all in."

5306, "Commander Cameron's crew has finished their interrogation of Kendra. She doesn't know who her employer was but was able to give details of their intermediary."

5307, "Through Kendra's information, the Albans have identified a convoy which could give clues to her employer's identity."

5308, "The convoy contains three Sinarus-flagged freighters with a cruiser escort. Their destination is Guardador Station, a mining hub in Sulsia that was comandeered by the Malikans several days ago."

5309, "The cargo manifest on those freighters mentions heavy mining equipment but the Albans believe they're shipping weapons under cover."

5310, "The Albans want one of the freighters so they can dissect her cargo for clues. This is where we come in."

5311, "The Hoshikuzu will jump in just inside ASM range of the convoy and launch missile strikes against the convoy's escorts. The hope is that the Combine warships are lured into an engagement away from their charges."

5312, "Once an opening is made, you need to disable the astrogation systems of one of the freighters. This is critical. We cannot commit the rest of our group until we're sure the freighters won't be able to make a run for it."

5313, "Once this is done we'll call in the Nassau, Hopewell and the Aria to assault the Combine ships."

5314, "This is going to be a balancing act. As long as the Combine think they're dealing with a solitary corvette, they'll be less inclined to warp out."

5315, "One more thing you two should know. The Hoshi's drone bay got replaced by her ASM launcher, so you won't have any repair drones for the first part of the mission. Be careful out there."

5316, "I think that's it. Probably the most insane job I've ever accepted, but your Commander Cameron is paying us premium rates. It helps that I've got you two with me to help pull this through."

; m21_vn.txt

5317, "I got an urgent communication from Admiral Bertini's office. The old bulldog wants us flying alongside his flagship against the Malikans. He's got firm intel on Gadaria's location and he wants blood."

5318, "The terrorist leader has been tracked to Jotram station, the logistical, military and spiritual heart of the Malika People's Militia. The place is a fortress, but Bertini wants us to crack it open."

5319, "The Sulsians didn't say why Gadaria withdrew back home after spending months in the front lines, though I'd bet good money the inbound Commonwealth battle group's got something to do with it."

5320, "It doesn't matter. The Sulsian navy has been crippled by months of Malikan hit and run attacks and most ships have been destroyed or are under repair. Admiral Bertini needs escort ships for the attack on Jotram Station."

5321, "Bertini's primary objective is to locate Andri Gadaria and bring him to justice."

5322, "Fringe law is relatively straightforward in this regard. Justice for the Sulsians means death, whether it's through a court-sentenced execution or missile warheads."

5323, "I've accepted his contract. I didn't even negotiate a higher payment. If Bertini wants to send Gadaria to hell, I'm one hundred percent on board."

5324, "Jotram Station is the hub of asteroid mining operations in the system. It was the site of the first worker rebellion that birthed the Malika People's Militia."

5325, "Bertini plans for it to be the site where the Militia dies."

5326, "Sulsian intelligence on the station is comprehensive. Jotram is heavily guarded by the cruisers Yama and Virago, and a screen of smaller corvettes."

5327, "The Protogeneia is the sole remaining heavy unit of the Sulsian Navy and will be the backbone of the assault. The Hoshikuzu and Nassau is to provide CIWS support against Malikan gunships and ASMs."

5328, "Bertini assures me the Protogeneia can eat the smaller Malikan ships for breakfast. What the battlecruiser can't do is counter small strike craft and missiles. We'll just have to do that for her."

5329, "Last time the Hoshikuzu faced off against Gadaria's ships, she was a converted transport with only a few light cannons as armament. This time she's a fully armed warship, and she's got friends."

5330, "It's time to buckle up. Today the Hoshi and Nassau go to war."

; m22_vn.txt

5331, "Lieutenant Ross. My congratulations on your victory at Jotram Station. The entire operation was a risk but Bertini was never a man of temperance."

5332, "The strategic situation in Sulsia remains volatile. We've received word that the Children of Renewal congregation is heading for the Pallavian Veil via Sulsian space."

5333, "We believe this is one reason why the Malikans have halted their advance and pulled back. We're unsure how the Children of Renewal prompted this, as they have no military capacity to threaten Gadaria."

5334, "Admiral Cleghorn has authorised a light unit detachment to shadow the Renewal congregation. Due to the proximity of the Veil to Sulsia, we need to identify any possible threats to future Commonwealth operations here."

5335, "I want your ships with me. Our task is to escort the Renewal convoy to it's destination and discover their intentions there."

5336, "Your Katherine Lau already has a professional relationship with Reverend Lightowler on Covenant, and I plan to take full advantage of this."

5337, "I've contacted Reverend Lightowler. He's given us the coordinates of the Renewal's final destination. It's deep within the Pallavian Veil, off of all major cartographical charts."

5338, "This is the location of the Children of Renewal's 'Promised Land'. They're making the final journey with their entire contingent."

5339, "I've checked our long range sensors. There's a black hole orbiting a K-type star, but no detectable planets or other system bodies. Lightowler assures me the coordinates correspond to high orbit of an Earth-like planet."

5340, "It's possible the black hole or the Veil itself is confounding our long range sensors. If there is a planet out there, we might not be able to see it."

5341, "The Children of Renewal have shared their space charts with us. If we need to make our way out without Covenant, we'll be able to use their navigation data."

5342, "I suspect this is the last job that the Renewal are offering us. Lightowler's offering an astronomical payment for this job, enough for me, Navo and Badami to retire comfortably and the rest of our group to receive a generous payout."

5343, "I don't know if this 'Promised Land' is real. I suppose it doesn't matter. It's real enough to the Children of Renewal and that's good enough for my conscience."

5348, "It didn't turn out so bad I suppose. Managed to make a difference out here. Showed the Combine a thing or two about messin wi the Commonwealth didn't we?"

5349, "Anyway, a think this is the end for me lad. My fighting days are done. The cocktail hangovers are getting rougher an lasting longer. They say your body lets you know when it's had enough and mine's shouting at me pretty damn loud."

5374, "Back to business. I've been told you're cleared to fly Hornets, the birds Beta flew in the last sortie."

5375, "Hornets are strike fighters best at taking out warship subsystems and turrets. They're tougher than Vipers but aren't as nimble."

5425, " Your job will be to cover the boarding operation against further Combine attack."

5426, "Razor, you're with Ahab on Alpha. Congratulations on the callsign. Raptor and Cook are Beta. Punchy and Soap will make up Gamma."

5429, "This is Rear Admiral Akrami to all personnel serving Task Force 55. This is a priority communique."

5430, "A Combine battlegroup led by the carrier Excelsior has attacked Elam and Federation positions throughout Elam space."

5431, "Task Force 55 has exchanged weapons fire with Combine warships. These are the first confrontations of a cold war gone hot."

5432, "We've taken casualties but we've given just as good as we got."

5433, "The Combine have finally shown their hand. Now it's time to finish this game."

5434, "This is it, people. The Combine have thrown down the gauntlet and invaded Durius as part of a coordinated multi-system action. Here's the situation."

5435, "Enemy disposition: The Combine command ship Excelsior is fifteen klicks out and approaching at flank speed. She's launched a wing of Ka-15 'Defender' fighters, but we expect further strike launches are on the way."

5436, "Artemis and Euphrates are maintaining static defensive position alongside Durius Installation. Squadron wings are to take up security positions around the warships and provide an area screen."

5437, "The Excelsior carries a stockpile of the Combine strategic armament. We can expect the use of nuclear weapons. Target her Eos missiles as a priority."

5438, "The carrier's heavy bombers also present a nuclear threat. Keep your eyes open for bomber deployment and prosecute these HVTs as necessary."

5439, "Rear Admiral Akrami's Colossus has been diverted from Akkad to provide support. We need to hold our ground long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

5440, "However, FTL sensors also report hostile attack ships converging on our position."

5441, "It is likely these Combine reinforcements will arrive before the Colossus does."

5442, "We'll be outnumbered and outgunned for most of this battle, but Durius Installation does not fall, understand? The fort must hold."

5443, "Everyone that's fit to fly goes out today. We need all hands on deck and everyone at their best."

5444, "Get to your fighters. You've got this. You're good enough for this. Go make the Federation proud."

5449, "Two hours ago we lost FTL comms with Fifth Fleet Command. All outbound communications traffic from Morik have ceased."

5450, "30 minutes ago, long range sensors detected a significant cosmological event in the Morik system."

5451, "A massive energy burst was detected, powerful enough to cause shockwaves through hyperspace."

5452, "My analysts believe this is the cause of the comms blackout."

5453, "A disaster of unprecedented scale appears to have happened at Morik. I am authorising a reconnaissance mission to the system."

5454, "Morik is a critical military and industrial hub, and was home to the bulk of Fifth Fleet."

5459, "We still await personnel replenishment to bring our crew and pilot numbers back up to a full complement."

5460, "Despite these setbacks, I know we're still more than capable of performing this mission."

5461, "Deck crews will notice the new complement of Thunderbolt interceptors."

5462, "Our mission parameters have changed. With the escalating conflict, we are progressing into an ASM-heavy combat environment."

5463, "This is in contrast to the fighter-heavy combat of the Elam-Qahtadnan conflict."

5464, "The journey to Morik will take several days. Updates will be forthcoming as soon as they're available."

5465, "GILES CAVILL - CAG"

5466, "Hey Ross. Looks like I'll be stuck in Durius Installation medbay for a while. The medics tell me I'm still on enforced sick leave."

5467, "I got a report from forensics after they dug through my bird - looks like a Combine shell tore through the air filter and gave me a dose of waste emissions before the safeties kicked in."

5468, "Anyway, I may grumble but I'm counting my lucky stars I'm still here. Doing better than a lot of other people."

5469, "Not making me any less impatient to be back in the cockpit. Don't get into too much trouble out there while I'm down, okay?"

5471, "Bertone"

5472, "Hi Razor. I'm leaving the Artemis and joining up with the Colossus fighter squadron. Everyone gets a goodbye note. This is yours."

5473, "We haven't really talked much but you seem like a good guy. You're an Alban like Raptor so you get bonus points."

5474, "Take care of Raptor while I'm gone, okay? You let anything happen to her, I'll come find you and kick your ass."

5475, "Ok Razor. I'll see you round."

5476, "Raptor, Razor. Our two Alban representatives. Welcome."

5477, "We have arrived in the midst of a debris field."

5478, "Positioning reads correct. We should be in the vicinity of Fifth Fleet headquarters. Instead there's rubble."

5479, "The planet Bulwark was a temperate Earth-like planet with a thriving planetary infrastructure."

5480, "Nothing's left on the surface but molten rock."

5481, "Our sensors are reading massive gravitational shifts within a relatively localised area in space."

5482, "Shear forces are causing extreme tectonic shifting on the planet's crust."

5483, "This appears to be the result of a massive, temporary gravity well in close proximity to the planet."

5484, "We have no idea what caused this, nor whether this is some sort of new Combine weapon."

5485, "We can confirm that this is a disaster of unprecedented scale, but the mission must go on."

5486, "Both of you will fly as Alpha wing. Waypoint coordinates will be sent to your ships."

5493, "Lieutenant, I've had the exec bring you into the Longview roster. You should now have system access."

5494, "There is much to do and little time to do it. The following is a summary of events."

5495, "Five days ago a major engagement took place at Bulwark which resulted in the utter destruction of Fifth Fleet, and the devastation of Bulwark's surface. We call this the Cataclysm."

5496, "The Combine deployed a weapons platform never before encountered. All reports suggest it was some sort of superweapon of immense power."

5497, "Two hours after the cataclysm, Combine forces moved into Morik from Actium and seized strategic assets throughout the system. Admiral Lucja Romanowska and her command ship Imperatrix leads the Combine occupation, but we have no intel on her location."

5498, "Morik is saturated with hyperspace interference, making intersystem communications impossible. I've had to deploy couriers out to Shen Kuo, Akkad and Lincoln to establish contact with other Federation task groups."

5499, "Once reinforcements arrive from these systems we can assault Romanowska and her superweapon, and take back Morik from the Combine."

5500, "That all comes later. For now I have a mission for you. Briefing is at 1330hrs."

5501, "Lieutenant Ross. Lieutenant McKearney. Thank you for coming."

5502, "Our target is Juliet Base, the command centre for Federation Defense Intelligence on Bulwark. Recon sweeps suggest that Juliet Base survived the Cataclysm abandoned but intact."

5503, "Juliet holds the Mira data retrieved by the Sycorax and is also a major storage depot for Fifth Fleet. We believe the Mira data contains crucial information related to the Cataclysm weapon."

5504, "The storage depot also has supplies we desperately need."

5505, "Commander Bastow will be leading this mission from the heavy transport Rocinante. You are to launch your interceptors from her hangar once she is on location."

5506, "The engineering shuttle Uriel will accompany the Rocinante along with the personnel transport Phoenix."

5507, "Your mission is to patrol Juliet and clear the area. When this is done, the shuttles will dock to secure the base."

5508, "The Uriel will dock with the energy hub to restore power. Once the Command centre is powered and online the Rocinante can access the data network."

5509, "The Phoenix will dock with the base hangars and identify any flight-suitable strikecraft to reinforce your air patrol."

5510, "Once Juliet has been secured, the rest of the flotilla will begin procurement of the military supplies."

5511, "This is our one chance to make this work. Good luck out there."

5512, "Ross, McKearney. Lieutenant Wade Murphy. CAG of what passes for the Longview's fighter wing."

5513, "Lancaster will probably have my head over this, but I don't know if you realise how bad things are."

5514, "We're days away from running out of supplies and ammunition. Morale is rock bottom."

5515, "I've done my best to scrounge together every pilot I could find for this mission. You pull this off, we can probably make this thing work."

5519, "I work with Alban Naval Intelligence. I've been chasing Solaris, a Fed weapons research project that ANI got wind of a few months back. It looks like the Combine have managed to coopt Solaris for themselves."

5520, "Commonwealth Military Command has also been monitoring the situation on the Morik war front. There's reports that the entire front line is collapsing."

5521, "Someone in FDI screwed up, and screwed up hard. They must've known the Combine had used their Solaris data to build their own version, but they were still blindsided."

5522, "We suspect that Solaris goes back all the way to the Elam war. The Federation weren't supporting the Republic out of the kindness of their hearts."

5523, "The Federation wanted the Mira system, and I suspect that 'Combine' base was actually FDI's."

5524, "The Combine destroyed the base before ANI could move in. However, it seems we got lucky."

5525, "That intel you got from Juliet is the break we needed. I'm putting together a plan to get a copy of the data to ANI."

5526, "Thanks to Lancaster's terrible operation security, you and McKearney are in the perfect position to help us crack Solaris."

5527, "The Commonwealth presumes your cooperation in this matter. Let's not ruin a good thing, shall we?"

5528, "Pilots, eyes up. You need to see this."

5529, "We've intercepted a distress call from the Osiris, flagship of Rear Admiral Colvin and command ship of task force 57."

5530, "The Osiris entered Morik about ten minutes ago with the Combine dreadnought Vindicator in pursuit. From Combine comms traffic it looks like Romanowska has also deployed the Veritas to intercept."

5531, "Colvin's carrier won't be able to withstand the firepower of the Vindicator and Veritas. Despite the risk, I've authorised a support mission."

5532, "Ross, McKearney. You'll be Alpha wing. Both of you are Murphy's first choices for flight duty, so I've authorised you to fly the Phantom stealth fighters."

5533, "Current doctrine states they're used best setting up ambushes against enemy strikecraft and warship turrets. Use them well."

5534, "Murphy, I want you to pull up a roster of who else we've got available. I want everyone capable of flying out there."

5535, "XO, set a condition one throughout the ship. We jump in five minutes."

5536, "Hey. This doesn't look good. I'm not sure you know this, but Task force 57 was stationed at Shen Kuo to garrison the system against Combine attack."

5537, "It was the most powerful task force in Fifth Fleet, other than the Morik garrison. Our entire operation here depended on Colvin's ships reinforcing our position."

5538, "If the Osiris is here, it's likely Shen Kuo, and Task Force 57 have been lost."

5539, "Anyway, doesn't change our mission. We need to get the Admiral out of there alive."

5540, "I'll see you on the flight deck. I need to pep up some of the rookie pilots before we go out there. This is going to be rough."

5541, "Heads up Lieutenant. I've had to expedite things."

5542, "Looks like Lancaster finally found someone with enough clearance to read the Morik data. What Colvin dug up is...cataclysmic, if you pardon the term."

5543, "Get a physical copy of the decrypted Mira data from McKearney. She'll have a backup of her own. We need to bring this to Alban Naval Intelligence."

5544, "I'm getting both of you out of there. Leave everything to me. Just make sure you have the data on you when you fly out."

5550, "Once we arrive, we will reestablish contact with Command and await further orders."

5551, "Evacuation of Ariel Station will begin in three hours. All ship commanders are to supervise final checks for departure and prepare to receive hyperspace coordinates."

5552, "Once the station evacuation has been confirmed, I will transmit authorisation to jump."

5553, "On arrival to Akkad, further information will be forthcoming. Until then you have your orders."

5554, "Admiral Colvin, signing off."

5555, "Pilots. This is a priority operation, and I expect your full attention."

5556, "The location of Ariel Station has been compromised. Combine forces have tracked the Osiris to the station and relayed our position to the Imperatrix."

5557, "Ten minutes ago the Imperatrix entered the vicinity and blockaded Ariel station. She was accompanied by the cruiser Naga. Recon elements report more Combine ships are on the way."

5558, "I am launching our remaining fighter strength to screen Fifth Fleet assets against Combine attack. The Imperatrix has not yet launched a fighter or ASM strike but Romanowska may be waiting until she can bring her full weight of arms to bear."

5559, "The carrier Longview is holding the majority of the station personnel. The rest will be on board the transports Rocinante and Estella Haversham."

5560, "I am holding the Osiris in position to provide area defense for the evacuation transports and Longview until the evacuation is complete."

5561, "Once the evacuation is complete, our ships will have to move clear of the surrounding asteroid field before they can jump. We will likely be running a gauntlet of Combine warships."

5562, "Achieving space superiority and undertaking focused strikes against the Combine warships will be necessary for successful transit."

5563, "Many pilots from Longview will be flying alongside Osiris pilots today. Note that your wing allocation is determined by seniority and experience. There's not many of you left."
