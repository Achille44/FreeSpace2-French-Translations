MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "The Sulsian Hegemony government signed an instrument of surrender at the capital Seleste today, marking the end of the war between the Malika People's Militia and the Hegemony." 7352 "27a-02"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "Present were representatives from the Alban Commonwealth, Jacobine Republique, Malika People's Militia and the Sinarus Combine." 7353 "27a-03"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "The surrender comes after several setbacks for the Sulsians, including the loss of the Sulsian fleet at Vicare and the nuclear attack on the Seleste planetary capital with Malikan stealth missiles." 7354 "27a-04"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "Terms of surrender were arbitrated by the Commonwealth Diplomatic Corps on behalf of the Hegemony." 7355 "27a-05"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "Half of the Hegemony's territory will be administrated by the new Malika People's Republic, with the remainder nominally Sulsian but split between Commonwealth and Republique administration." 7356 "27a-06"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "The Sinarus Combine was not invited to negotiate on behalf of the Malika People's Republic." 7357 "27a-07"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "Marshal Andri Gadaria, leader of the People's Republic, celebrated the signing as a landmark for the Malikan people and vowed to champion the cause for indentured workers everywhere." 7358 "27a-08"
MSGXSTR "CBN" 6851 "For its duration, the Sulsian-Malikan conflict contributed to significant commodity and energy cost increases throughout Terran space, with economies already disrupted by the Federation-Combine war." 7359 "27a-09"

MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "The Honourable Prime Minister expects Archon Sarshar to come to the negotiating table, and that we still hold political leverage over his nation as was so forty years ago." 7364 "27a-11"
MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "I argue that those days are over. What clout we exercised over old Sol has evaporated with the rebuilding of their fleets, and the increasing despotism of their Archon." 7365 "27a-12"
MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "I argue that the dictator cares little for promises when he holds the position of strength. The Sinarussians call their weapon 'Black Sun', a grotesque echo of the Atlantean 'Solaris'. In Black Sun, Sarshar sees an insurmountable advantage." 7366 "27a-13"
MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "We are past the time for negotiation, past time for appeasement. Let His Majesty's Advanced Threat Identification program be a start. If we want lasting peace, we must resist the Combine Archon and all of his machinations." 7367 "27a-14"
MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "Black Sun is an affront to all civilised nations past and current. It is an insult to the memory of Earth and the sacrifices made in the Great War. It is a barbarous concept that deserves all our condemnation." 7368 "27a-15"
MSGXSTR "Howe" 7363 "Our navy is already hard at work in Sulsia challenging Sarshar's agents who protect the secrets of the Combine weapon. I say give them the tools, so that they may finish the job." 7369 "27a-16"

MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "LC. I'm sorry to cut your recuperation short. Urgent mission orders have arrived from Captain Tierney. This is Aria's moment." 7372 "27a-17"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "The mission is personnel retrieval. Cleghorn needs Katherine Lau and Verma Erikson from the Hoshikuzu group. These two specific individuals will play a crucial role in our preparations for the Veil." 7373 "27a-18"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "I haven't been informed what role they'll play against Kakotchka but it's not difficult to guess how Lau fits into this. She has close relations to Reverend Lightowler, who we know has control over the alien technology." 7374 "27a-19"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "Verma Erikson's background is largely unknown. If I were to guess, she's an informant. Maybe a Combine operative in exile? Tierney and Cleghorn are keeping tight lipped about it. Guesses are all I've got right now." 7375 "27a-20"

MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "There's evidence of Combine agents tracking Lau and Erikson. An entire NavInt squadron is reported to be on standby to apprehend them. We need to get to them before the Combine do." 7378 "27a-23"
