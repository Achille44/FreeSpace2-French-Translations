4003, "Following the success of the Myrmidon, RNI Systems immediately began work on another ship design, this time a far heavier ship. The result was the Azaes heavy assault fighter. Designed to maximise its blend of Terran and Vasudan technology, the Azaes is an assault bomber, with good shielding, thick armour and a large missile capacity, however, typical of Terran/Vasudan hybrids, the ship still maintains moderately good speed and manouverability. The main feature of the Azaes is the 'Maul' Chaingun mounted along the sides of the ship. These massive guns, totalling nearly 15 metres in length, with 5m long barrels, are capable of ripping unshielded hull to pieces. Coupled with a good Missile yield and a quad-gun Primary energy weapon, the Azaes is a force to be feared by smaller capital ships."

With its origins shrouded in mystery and it's impressive performances and weaponary, it's already a favourite among pilots, and is claimed as being the successfull child of a perseus and an erinyes."

4108, "The GTC Hyperion is the first class of Terran cruiser to be commissioned since the second great war.  Combining the anti-fighter capabilities and speed of the outgunned Aeolus and the armor of the Leviathan, the Hyperion is a formidable target for strike craft to engage.  In addition, it has been fitted with two advanced beam cannons, which draw their power directly from the main engines.  A step above the standard armament for a cruiser, the Hyperion packs as much forward punch as a Deimos with a much smaller crew complement.  The Hyperion is rapidly filling the ranks of the GTVA, phasing out earlier cruiser models."

The consequence of this is slightly reduced armour and speed compared to the Iceni, but the Saphah remains a powerful vessel.  Rumours that major security breaches during the NTF conflict that led to the Iceni's escape were engineered in order to gather data on the vessel for Project Saphah have been strenuously denied by the heads of GTVI."

"

4585, "You have been offered and have accepted an invitation to join the GTAII or Galactic Terran Anti-Insurgency Intelligence, informally called NeoIntel by her members.  You have passed our rigorous psychological and physical evaluations with flying colors.  We welcome you to NeoIntel, agent."

4586, "NeoIntel was formed shortly after the Hades Rebellion perpetrated by the elite members of the old GTI, or Galactic Terran Intelligence.  We were formed by the Galactic Terran Security Council and have been in operation ever since.  Our primary mission is to seek out and eliminate political or military insurrections, preferably while in their infancy.  It was a NeoIntel operative that first alerted the GTVA to the NTF threat and it was NeoIntel pilots who eliminated the last vestiges of the Hammer of Light.  With NeoIntel, you join a long and proud legacy."

4587, "We operate in complete and total secrecy here at NeoIntel.  The GTVA, the GTVI, and the Vasudan Imperium have no knowledge of our existence.  We answer only to the Galactic Terran Security Council.  This secrecy is of the utmost importance.  One of the primary duties of NeoIntel is the monitoring of the use and possible abuse of GTVI power.  As the Hades Rebellion showed, the concentrated power of the GTI and current GTVI can be a powerful corrupting force."

4588, "During your missions, agent, you may be asked to carry out unusual and even unethical objectives.  Understand that everything we do is for the greater good of the Human race.  Act on orders in mission without question.  Answers will always be given to you once the mission has concluded or there is a lull in the action.  To fly for NeoIntel, you must act quickly and decisively.  Seconds count in this business."

4589, "To facilitate the secrecy of NeoIntel, we will many times fly Vasudan or even captured Shivan fighters in order to hide our identity.  Our effectiveness as an organization depends on the complete lack of knowledge concerning our existence."

4590, "You have been assigned to the NeoIntel command destroyer Achilles.  As you may know, the Achilles disappeared several years ago inexplicably.  Many of the ships in our fleet are ghost ships in one sense or another.  The Achilles, along with the 5th Galactic Terran Exploration Fleet, assisted in the elimination of a recent Vasudan insurrection involving a second Hades destroyer, codenamed Dante.  As far as anyone is concerned, there was no insurrection and the Achilles is still missing in action."

4591, "Within NeoIntel, your designation is Agent 750.  I am Agent 33.  I'm sure you'd like the opportunity to settle in, but we have a pressing need for those fighter skills.  You'll be shipping out within the hour.  Report to your briefing, agent."

4592, "Alright, agents, let's get down to business.  Since there are a few new faces here, I'll try to fill you all in.  We've been observing a certain Admiral Mizraim rather closely for the past six months.  Mizraim is about as xenophobic a Vasudan as you can possibly find, publicly exposing his belief that interaction with Terrans will ultimately undermine the Vasudan society.  Unfortunately, due to his power and influence, these views have a good chance of becoming policy."

We have decided that now is the opportune time to eliminate this disruptive element before he can transform his views into Vasudan government policy, perhaps even eventually undermining BETAC."

4603, "To hide the fact that Terrans are involved in this operation, you will be flying Vasudan fighters.  A Vasudan AWACS, designated Tartarus, will provide jamming coverage for this mission.  It is our hope that a Vasudan faction opposed to Mizraim will be implicated in his death."

4604, "However, Mizraim, while distrustful of humans, is a brilliant tactician.  Given a certain degree of . . . conditioning . . . we believe we could make Mizraim a valuable asset to NeoIntel.  Therefore, this is a capture operation.  Beta will engage the fighters while Alpha disables and disarms the Anqet."

4605, "Once all opposition has been eliminated, a commando transport, designation Panzer, will be brought in to board the Anqet and apprehend Mizraim.  Once Mizraim has been captured, the commando team will set explosives and destroy the Anqet along with any evidence that Mizraim is missing."

4606, "We have timed this operation to coincide with minimal node traffic.  However, there is a possibility that some ships may emerge.  If this happens, you are authorized and required to eliminate all ships.  We must ensure that no one witnesses this operation.  Gamma wing will be standing by to provide additional assistance, should it be required."

4607, "Excellent work, Agent 750.  Your first mission with NeoIntel was a complete and total success.  Mizraim is in our custody and our psychological specialists will begin reconditioning him for our needs.  Once that is complete, I have no doubt that Mizraim will have much to contribute to NeoIntel.

You also ensured the secrecy of this operation.  Though distasteful, the elimination of all craft entering the area was necessary for the greater good of the GTVA.  The lives lost today would have paled in comparison to the lives lost in another possible civil war.  You are to be commended on your thoroughness.

However, we still have work to do.  Reports indicate that while NeoIntel's identity was protected, a group within the Vasudan military has been implicated in Mizraim's death.  A very testy situation between two Vasudan battlegroups is forming.  If it grows out of hand, we will dispatch a team to stabilize the situation.

That is all, agent.  Again, excellent work."

4608, "I personally can't stand Taurets, agent.  Give me an Erinyes or Ares any day.  Plus that smell . . . haven't Vasudans ever heard of showers?"

4609, "You botched the mission, agent.  We expected more from you, a great deal more than this.  Your wings are hereby suspended until further notice, pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into this blunder.

Dismissed, pilot."

4610, "Try to take out the antifighter beam and the engines at the same time.  If fighters become a problem, engage any that are attacking you, then continue to disable the Anqet.

4721, "The destroyer under attack is the Heliopolis, a Typhon-class vessel that is currently undergoing beam-weapon calibration in the Delta Serpentis system.  In other words, the 9th is hitting the 4th while its down.  If left alone, the Typhon destroyer will be lost."

4722, "NeoIntel will dispatch twelve fighters to pacify the situation, under the guise of GTVA squadrons.  Alpha and Gamma will fly Erinyes and perform a sweep of the area, eliminating all Vasudan fighters and bombers.  They're easy enough to replace.  Beta will fly beam weapon suppression against the corvettes."

4723, "We will have to act quickly.  Though the fighter engagement will likely be a draw, the Typhon will not last long against the beams of two corvettes."

4724, "Agent 750, we've heard your something of a hotshot when it comes to anti-beam work.  If necessary, we will divert you from fighter/bomber suppression to anti-beam duty.  Remember that Sobeks have two main beam cannons, their forward-most weapons.  Target them by cycling or by using the V key on their cannon flares.  Your load of Trebuchets should allow you to engage the Sobeks outside of their weapons range, though we do not expect any capital ships to target your fighters."

4725, "Hopefully, this will be enough to allow cooler heads to prevail.  Without bombers or beam weapons on both sides, the engagement will end in a draw.  Remember, we don't care about fighter or bomber losses.  Corvettes and destroyers, however, are another matter.  See to it that all three capital ships survive."

4726, "Excellent work, agent.  Despite unforeseen intervention, all three capital ships survived the encounter.  GTVA forces have arrived on scene and we expect the Heliopolis will be back in general service within two months."

4727, "This is truly impressive, agent.  You performed above and beyond the call of duty."

4728, "Though we did lose the Heliopolis, there was little you could have done to save it against a beam weapon of that magnitude.  We can take consolation in the fact that two corvettes were saved and no further hostilities seem to be occurring."

4729, "Don't worry about it.  Crap like this happens."

4730, "Which brings us to that Terran attack on the Vasudans.  We do not know who or why the attack took place.  A capital ship of some kind, presumably Terran design, fired a beam weapon that registered like a Sathanas cannon.  The fighters, while Great War era Lokis, were equipped with a new stealth technology our instruments could not penetrate.

As you know, the Loki was originally designed as a GTI stealth fighter and played a prominent role in both the Hades Rebellion and the recent NTF Civil War.  While an aging design, we expect its features would be easily adaptable to more modern stealth technology.  Therefore, we suspect you were up against a technological testbed of some kind.

Our final conclusion is this: someone decided to utilize the confusion of the battle to test two new systems on live targets.  This group has access to advanced technology and precise intelligence.  The list of suspects is very short."

4731, "Stealth Lokis . . . what a Silent Threat ripoff.  Who designed this mission anyway?"

4732, "You failed, agent.  You were sent in to protect ALL capital ships and that is what we expected from you.  Your wings are hereby suspended until further notice, pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into this blunder.

Dismissed, pilot."

4733, "Use your Trebuchets immediately against the corvettes.   One Trebuchet is enough for each beam cannon.  Once that is done, finish off the fighters, then engage all successive waves, focusing on bombers.  Take out the Heliopolis's main gun when ordered to.  Watch out for the stealth fighters at the end.  They carry Kayser weaponry."

Despite NeoIntel's extensive intelligence network, we knew nothing of Zohar's existence until recently.  Further compounding the mystery, Zohar was apparently constructed near an uncharted jump node in a remote part of the Ross 128 system, covered by a Asteroid field."

Your primary objective is to find evidence related to the attack.  Scan any ships I order you to.  NeoIntel alone does not have the numbers for large-scale attacks.  Therefore we need evidence to back up our assumptions in order to mobilize GTVA forces."

4816, "Garrison forces around Zohar are a complete unknown.  If there are any ships of interest, I will order you to investigate.  Remember, this is a stealth mission.  Keep moving and do not fire your weapons unless necessary.  This is the kind of base where they shoot first and don't bother with questions."

4817, "Your secondary objective is to scan any vessels entering the area.  We may catch another operation returning to their base or perhaps incoming supplies.  Any and all data is desired by our analysts.  Good luck, agent.  Keep your head down out there."

4818, "Thanks to your diligent efforts, we now have incontrovertible proof that the attack originated from Zohar.  The beam was fired from the Proteus, one of the two science vessels you scanned, and the Loki configurations were identical to those you encountered earlier.

However, we do not know who was behind the attack.  Was it the Antietam's commanding officer, Admiral Hossel?  Or was it a subordinate?  More importantly, why did the attack take place?  We will continue to watch Zohar and the Antietam closely, acting only when we have undeniable proof of guilt.

You also assisted in gathering data on Zohar's Ganymede Cannon, the Saphah frigates, the uncharted node, and the Antietam itself.  All of this data will be poured over by NeoIntel analysts, allowing us to gain a better picture of what the GTVI and Admiral Hossel are doing at Zohar."

4819, "Well, at least you got to blow up SOMETHING . . . even if it was a radar dish."

4820, "You also were able to scan the two vessels heading for the node.  The presence of a gas miner and an AWACS indicates that the uncharted system MAY have nebular areas, though this is purely guesswork without actually passing through the node."

Unfortunately, it would seem our suspicions were correct.  The Vulcan testbed was piloted straight back to Zohar.  Crewmen from Admiral Hossel's command ship, the Antietam, then boarded the vessel and stripped it of its experimental systems.

Admiral Hossel, an officer of profound stature and professionalism, has been plotting against the GTVA.  It is a sad day indeed when such an officer AND his subordinates turn against all that we hold dear.

We now have more than enough proof to warrant a large scale operation against the Zohar installation.  Whatever Admiral Hossel's designs are, we will crush them utterly in one swift stroke.

To route out any possible leaks, I have initiated multiple internal investigations.  Anyone found divulging information to the enemy will be summarily executed.

Prepare for your next mission, pilot.  It's time to finish off Admiral Hossel's fleet."

"

5075, "Agents, given the seriousness of the situation with Hossel, I have granted you clearance level Epsilon.  You are now authorized to receive a briefing on the Orpheus Project. Q, NeoIntel's Director of Technology will deliver this briefing."

5076, "Greetings agents.
During the second Shivan incursion, advanced fighters like the Erynies proved very effective against this terrible enemy. But the Erynies was also a rushed design: very expensive, difficult to maintain, and with several design flaws. Two other fighters were in competition with the Erynies at that time. However, the urgency of the situation demanded that the Erynies be put into service as it was the only craft to have completed flight testing. As the war reached its end, the GTVA decided to restart the Orpheus project. The two other prototypes, had undergone extensive refinement such that they came up to the required standards for the Orpheus Multi role Fighter Project:"

5077, "The Ezechiel is the first try at spacecraft for Senecal Hydrospace, a company specialized in submarines and surface ships. Senecal already had experience in the spaceship industry, however, as they have been the manufacturers for most subspace drives for light spaceships to date. Furthermore they have the proud heritage of being the ones who built the subspace reading device that helped track the Lucifer on the famous mission which dealt the final blow to the Shivan war machine during the Great War."

5078, "The Ezechiel is an surprising mix of old and new technology. Based on a rather conventional frame, it features a couple of intriguing systems to meet the Orpheus Project directives.
The ship is a rather stocky and heavy fighter. Survivability is improved by very thick armor and strong shields. If its secondary payload can be considered light, it still packs an awesome punch thanks to eight gun mounts located on the two side rails of the ship.
These rails also serve to meet the speed requirements of the OP. While four high impulse deuterium engines are used in cruise, the ship can reach a tremendous speed for a short period of time thanks to the two side rails.  These rails use Subspace Gliding Rail technology, or SGR, to open localized rifts between space and subspace."

5079, "We have tracked down Admiral Hossel's fleet to yet another installation situated near the unrecorded jump node in Ross 128.  However, Hossel's forces appear to be entering the node en masse.  The only ships that can reach the base in time are four Ezechiels."

5084, "Our intelligence of Hossel's operations near this node indicates that he is abandoning the base and heading through the node.  Therefore, your objective will be to destroy as many of the departing craft as possible.  You won't be a match for any of Hossel's warships, so restrict your engagements to transports and freighters.  Don't let a single transport reach the node."

5085, "Though most of the known Hossel forces, including the GTF Shiloh, GTF Pharsalus, and GTCv Longret, are proceeding into the node, we have no intelligence on the location of the Antietam.  However, we expect it to arrive at the base before you do."

5086, "Panther"

5087, "Remember, Hossel's forces may deploy advanced technologies such as Shivan weaponry and the new stealth system.  Hossel has had access to all the resources of the GTVI for a substantial period of time and could have a few more surprises up his sleeves.  Be prepared for anything, agents."

5088, "Once Hossel's fleet has abandoned the base, we may choose to capture what remains.  If so, we have one Elysium-class transport crewed with engineers and marines standing by.  If deployed, defend Panther and the Alcides installation until we have captured any desirable materials.  Good luck, agents.  Time to show Hossel just how horrible a mistake he's made."

5089, "I have good news and I have bad news, Agent 750.

First, we did destroy a great quantity of Admiral Hossel's war material departing the Alcides base.  Cursory analysis of the wreckage using your flight recorder indicates the convoy was carrying examples of Shivan technology and warship construction materials.  Excellent work depriving our enemy of those supplies.

We also captured the SCv Metatron, a corvette that Hossel had probably captured during the recent Shivan incursion that ended in the destruction of the Capella star.  We believe Hossel's engineers have reverse engineered many of the Metatron's systems, allowing them insight into Shivan technologies.

Our analysis of the battle indicates that those Lokis were cheaply constructed automated bombs, perhaps leftover stealth testbeds.  Also, I'm sure you noticed that the Antietam's beam weaponry was not operational during the fight.  Our analysts believe the Antietam may be hastily upgrading its beam weaponry to Shivan standards using materials from Zohar.

Now the really bad news.  Admiral Hossel has convinced GTVA Command that NeoIntel is plotting an open rebellion against the Alliance.  Command responded by dispatching the 2nd Fleet to hunt us down.

I have attempted to contact the Terran Security Council in order to explain the situation, with no success.  The government we served for so long believes we are the traitors Hossel claims us to be and . . . have abandoned us.  We are on our own.

We must act quickly, agents.  We not only must continue to hunt Hossel down, as is our duty as agents of NeoIntel, but we must avoid confrontation with the 2nd Fleet."

We have let our prey, the true rebel Admiral Hossel, slip from our grasp, and are now hunted by those we sought to defend."

5172, "The 2nd Fleet, lead by Admiral Brennin of the GTD Agamemnon, has been placed in charge of bringing us to justice.  Since we will not surrender, we can expect 2nd Fleet forces to shoot on sight.  Though it may become necessary to openly engage GTVA forces, we MUST keep their casualties to a minimum."

Though we have suspected for some time that his ultimate goal is rebellion, we do not know how he plans to carry out such an act.  The forces we have engaged would not last long against the Alliance, even battered as it is from the war against the Shivans."

5174, "The only way we can survive this is by finding concrete evidence of Hossel's true goals and the means he intends to use.  To do this, we will have to follow him into uncharted space while outpacing the 2nd Fleet.  To do this, we have planned a series of operations to keep us alive long enough to achieve victory."

5326, "This is grave indeed, Agent 750.  Somehow, Admiral Hossel has managed to construct a massive juggernaut: designation Titan.   This rebellion of his must have been years in the works.

The Titan's modular design appears partly to explain how Hossel could construct so large a ship without being detected. The Titan is made up of a large number of modules connected to a massive frame.  We have traced the registration numbers of the cargo containers discovered in the nebula.  Analysis of cargo manifests associated with them indicate that Hossel had these modules constructed in a number of shipyards in the guise of components needed for new GTVI installations.  These modules were then spirited away to the nebula where they were assembled and armed with Shivan derived weaponry.   We must now deal with the problem of destroying such an incredible vessel and of warning the Alliance about the true threat.

Imagine this, agent: a juggernaut-class vessel, armed to the teeth with recreated Shivan weaponry, its hangar full of Terran and Shivan fighters.  THAT, I fear, is what we are about to face."

Agent 750, you will tag incoming capital ships while the Seer masks our ship's locations and provides additional targeting data.  Once a ship is tagged, all beam cannons will be brought to bear.  One tag hit should be enough per ship."

We've linked our anti-fighter beams to the TAG system as well, so your missiles will be equally effective against fighters.  Just remember, you NEED your tags for capital ships.  Use your guns against fighters if you can."

The appearance of former-Admiral Mizraim on one of Hossel's frigates is disturbing.  Though we knew he was assisting Admiral Hossel with information during his tenure at NeoIntel, we did not expect Mizraim to be placed in command of one of Hossel's warships!  Fortunately, this seems to be a double-edge sword for Hossel, as Mizraim demonstrated that he has his own agenda in all of this.

If an overwhelming force arrives, your objective will be to record their exit vectors so that we may track Hossel's fleet through subspace."

5557, "We anticipated the destruction of Aquilae Station.  Even though its protection was not a priority, it is troubling to lose yet another installation to Hossel's fleet.  However, even as the Alliance takes these losses, we are whittling away at Hossel's fleet.

To your credit, the Hypaspists, the Phalanx, and the Europa were all successfully destroyed.  The attack by those three ships seemed to be designed to clear away any potential threat from fighter craft, opening up Aquilae Station for the Shiloh and Antietam.

This was also the first large-scale use by Hossel of his Shivan weaponry, giving his capital ships a distinct advantage over our own in both anti-fighter and anti-ship arenas.

NeoIntel is doing all it can to stem the flow of history, but our forces have been continually hindered by the Alliance's idiocy in blaming us for the attacks.  Fortunately, the mounting evidence of Hossel's treachery and of our own assistance is easing NeoIntel-Alliance relations.  We hope to reach an accord with the GTVA soon.

Get some rest while you can, agent.  You'll be launching in a few hours once again."

However, today we witnessed firsthand what a truly awesome weapon the Titan is.  A frontal assault using capital ships is simply not feasible.  And given the impressive array of flak guns, AAA beams, and turrets the Titan has, a fighter/bomber assault is equally daunting.

NeoIntel and Alliance forces are now working in full cooperation.  With our pooled resources and intelligence, we plan to isolate and destroy the spread-out ships comprising Hossel's fleet.  It is finally time to end our defensive engagements and to take the fight to Hossel himself."

Many of thee hath lost brethren when the traitor Hossel had some of the best vessels of 9th and 4th Fleet destroyed, or when he slew some of our youngest pilots at Aquilae Station.

Be not dismayed though, my kin, because today thou shalt avenge those of thy bretheren, that have been slain by the enemy. Thou shalt return victorious, and in the glory of thy fortitude thou shalt be immersed.

On thy valor resteth the hopes of thy kin today$semicolon and what surer grounds can they rest upon? Oppression now attempteth to bend thee down to servility$semicolon wilt thou burst its chains and rise to the independence of true Vasudan warriors? Thy cause is one approved by Heaven."

Thou knowest, that the enemy are strangers to religion and kindness$semicolon they are inflamed with the desire of violating the fairest sons of this land of beauty, and enriching themselves with the spoils of sacrilege and plunder. The barbarians have impiously fixed, for their struggle, to enslave us, upon the very day on which they rebelled.

Victory they shall not have! From such brave soldiers as thee, they can never wrest it. For thou fightest in defense of honor, liberty and religion - in defense of the sacred temples of the true Gods, and of thy sisters, wives and daughters.

Those which escaped thy weapons are floating in emptiness. One of the most impressive ships ever built, accompanied by several major vessels, under the command of a war proven veteran, hast been, within less than half an hour, cut to pieces.  This enemy, so vaunted, and in fanatism superior, could not resist thee, and henceforth thou hast no rivals from which to fear. Thus, in so short time, this rebellion has been vanquished and disbanded. Peace is now upon us. And as we promised our people before leaving Vasuda, we made only that peace, that would not see the traitor Hossel dicdating its terms!

Soldiers, when the Vasudan people placed the imperial crown upon our head, we entrusted ourself to thee to keep it forever in those rays of glory which alone make it worthy in our eyes. But at that same moment, our enemies thought to destroy and dishonor it! And this crown of iron, defended with the blood of so many Vasudans, Hossel wanted to compel us, to place it upon his filthy head!

Rash and senseless endeavor, which, upon the very anniversary of the crowning of thine Emperor, thou hast dashed and confounded. Thou hast taught further generations that it is easier to defy and to threaten us, than to defeat us!

Soldiers, now that all that is necessary to assure the happiness and prosperity of thy people hast been accomplished, we shalt bring thee back to Vasuda. There, thou wilt be the object of our most tender care. Our people shall greet thy return with joy, and it shall be enough for thee to say $quote I was at the Battle of Antares,$quote that the reply shall be, $quoteHere is a brave man$quote."

5811, "Well done
Did you notice? This victory speech is a changed version of Napoleons speech at Austerlitz $semicolon)"

5812, "You deserted, agent.  You are hereby stripped of your wings pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into your desertion.

Dismissed."

5813, "Emperor Khonsu is dead. Vasuda is lost. The entire Galaxy is engaged in a civil war worse than the NTF rebellion! That was not a very impressive performance, Pilot.
Oh and did I mention that there is no longer an organization such as NeoIntel since you managed to screw up?"

5814, "Keeping your wingmates alive is the key really in this mission! You will have a very hard time defending the pharaoh alone, or taking down the Shade for that matter."

5815, "Too bad you could not take out the Shade fast enough to save the Achilles, Agent 750. There really would have been a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel. However, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? At least you can ensure peace in some way then, pilot."

5816, "My commendation for keeping the Achilles alive and kicking during the whole battle Agent 750. Thankfully you took out the Shade fast enough to save those men. There really is a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel in times to come, and with the Achilles intact, we have a power base from which we can rebuild. 
Furthermore, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? I don't think I need to tell you, how much an improvement in Terran Vasudan relations this is, do I? I wish Mizraim could see this. I bet he would vomit over it, and that alone is worth the trouble, isn't it?
Congratulations on a job well done Agent."

5919, "As Emperor Khonsu III, lord of all Vasudans, we are offering thee a very last chance for redemption."

5920, "How very nice of you to bring those NeoIntel jesters with you your lordship. Too bad this will be the last of their funny plays!"

5921, "Bow before the might of our combined forces and surrender, or thou shall be crashed like the vermin thou art!"

5922, "Listen, idiot, you can take your redemption and shove it. Hossel out."

5923, "All vessels, engage the enemy! Crush the traitor, for filth like his kin does not deserve any different."

5924, "I�m  worried by Hossel�s confidence. He is greatly outnumbered and despite the Titan�s qualities he can't be hoping to bring down an armada like this one."

5925, "Something is not right here, Hossel has got to have some ace yet unplayed to throw to the table."

5926, "Alpha, Leo wing is moving towards the Achilles, bring down those bombers."

5927, "Pilots, beware! Ships are coming in from Beta Aquilae, Hossel must have reinforcements at his disposal. No.. wait, it's but a single ship with some fighter cover."

5928, "Oh.. This can't be true. The Titan just vanished from sensors. That ship must be some kind of AWACS device. Orders, Agent 33?"

5929, "I'm not the one giving orders this time, Achilles. Pharaoh, do you read me? What are the plans regarding the Titan�s cloaking?"

5930, "Terrans, Emperor Khonsu himself has granted you an audience in this matter."

5931, "Patch him through already!"

5932, "Terran Mistress, this is Emperor Khonsu. The ship the traitor is using to shield himself is a prototype design by the GTVI, designation GTHA Shade. "

5933, "Sendest thou warriors to take down that ship, for this battle is lost, if thou failest to disable the cloaking."

5934, "We cannot send warriors ourselves, they art too important to guard ourselves! Our blessings art with thee, warriors!"

5935, "That sucker! He is holding back some of the best pilots in the Vasudan fleet!"

5936, "No time to argue! We are launching Beta and Gamma wings of Bombers to take on the Shade. Alpha, waste anything in their way!"

5937, "Alpha, beware of Taurus wing, they are on an intercept course for Beta and Gamma!"

5938, "Hurry up, lads, the Shade is heading to a position near the Titan. There will be no bringing down that ship once it gets close to the Juggernaut."

5939, "The Titan is returning to sensors at last. First Fleet�s remaining ships are launching bombers now to take out the Titan. All beams will open fire. Pharaoh out."

5940, "Alpha, we are picking up some flaring signals on sensors, be on guard!"

5941, "More Flaring signals on sensors, Sir."

5942, "Oh my god, Those ships are armed to the teeth with explosives and going right for the Pharaoh! Alpha, save the Pharaoh and Emperor Khonsu!"

5943, "Confirmed, Agent 750. those ships appear to be some kind of unknown stealth ships, simular to Hossel�s stealth Lokis. Attack them, Alpha. Save the Emperor."

5944, "The Pharaoh has been destroyed, this is one of the darkest days in GTVA history, Pilots. Return to Vasuda."

5945, "We are losing health.  Fleet, protect the Emperor."

5946, "Pharaoh has lost half of its hull integrity. The Titan and its fleet must not be allowed to defeat the Emperor."

5947, "We are going critical. Saving the Emperor is our top priority!"

5948, "We have launched the Emperors personal guard now to protect us from the stealth ships, Terrans. Help them to defeat the rest of the fighters."

5949, "Leo wing is down, the Achilles is safe for now. Good work."

5950, "The Hellspawn is exploding. Good work 9th Fleet. Now for the Titan�s destruction."

5951, "The Antagonist is no more. 9th Fleet, press the attack, you are to annihilate the enemy."

5952, "The Shivan Corvettes are down, we are winning on the right."

5953, "The Ikhnaton is blowing up. I repeat, 4th fleet has lost its Flagship."

5954, "NO! The Horus has been destroyed by the enemy. Revenge our kindred, brethren!"

5955, "This day has seen the Nefertiti's last deeds. Let the enemy feel your wrath my brothers!"

5956, "The Dust lives up to its name now. Bring down the rest of Hossel�s terran vessels 4th fleet!"

5957, "Slasher wing of Deimos corvettes no longer guards the Titan�s right flank!"

5958, "The Titan hath destroyed the Scion. It is our wish that they art revenged."

5959, "We have lost the Ramses. This is a dark day."

5960, "The Traitor has taken out the Gizeh. We will not forget the deaths of those martyrs."

5961, "There goes the Achilles. NeoIntel just ceased to exist pilots. This was our last capital ship. I hope we at least can make their deaths count."

5962, "The bulk of 4th fleets corvettes are down."

5963, "9th fleet has lost most of its corvettes"

5964, "All the Sobeks guarding the Ramses are down"

5965, "The enemy terminated Scion Striker wing"

5966, "The Gizeh just lost the last of its guardians."

5967, "Beta wing is down, Alpha."

5968, "We have lost Gamma wing. Alpha what are you paid for?"

5969, "We have taken out Taurus, Sir"

5970, "The Shade's Mara cover is down!"

5971, "9th fleet's left wing has been destroyed."

5972, "9th fleet's right wing is lost"

5973, "4th fleet's left wing is reduced to glowing metal."

5974, "4th fleet, beware, your right wing is down."

5975, "We are loosing integrity rapidly, people. This mission does not bode well!"

5976, "We are doing damage in penny numbers, but the Titan is starting to feel the pressure."

5977, "The Titan is heavily damaged now. Keep firing, fleet!"

5978, "Thou art winning my kindred. Blast away the Titan, for the traitor is standing at death's edge! End that petty rebellion here and now! FOR THE EMPIRE!"

5979, "The shade is disabled. Bombers waste that ship!"

5980, "Alpha, a new group of stealth fighters is heading for the Emperor�s Ship. Pharaoh, Alpha needs help!"

5981, "And so it ends. The Titan is no more, we have won. Yet, another such victory and we are undone. Let us hope that this victory stops any further attempts to overthrow GTVA rule for some time!"

5982, "Alpha, you are authorized to dock in Fighterbay1. The Emperor wants to commend you and his guard on your achievements today. Not least of all: saving his life! Pharaoh out."

5983, "Noooooo, I can't loose to such a bunch of fools!  I will defeat you! Helm, full power to all beams!"
