As they are replaced by Herc IIs, Myrmidons, and other recent designs, Hercules fighters are increasingly relegated to training and guard duties far from the front lines. Pilots who've flown Hercs for years love the ship's heavy armor and firepower and have learned to compensate for its low speed and poor maneuverability.

The Loki's micro-roughened hull and shielded exhaust chamber give it an extremely reduced profile to detection sensors. This makes it ideal for reconnaissance and infiltration missions that rely on stealth rather than firepower. Lacking the weaponry and armor to survive prolonged battles, the Loki can usually stay alive long enough for its high maneuverability and speed to discourage pursuers.

The challenge of maintaining an aging fleet has motivated the GTVA to develop a new generation of ships able to withstand long-term abuse in the field. By maximizing shielding and payload (while offering enough maneuverability to make it a viable tactical unit), the Boanerges promises to remain in service for decades to come. One test pilot observed that the Boanerges handles better than any other bomber and has enough firepower to make it a formidable anti-capship weapon."

3035, "The GTDr Amazon Model IV unmanned combat drone was once used for live basic combat training. They weren't tough, they weren't smart, and they weren't well armored. But they blew up very nicely. These drones are no longer manufactured, but their virtual counterparts are used in the Training Simulator Module (TSM) series. The Model IV is every fighter pilot's first TSM opponent, the first mobile foe he faces during simulator courses. If you can't handle an Amazon during training, it's time to reconsider your choice of careers."

3036, "The GTDr Amazon Advanced Model VII was an unmanned combat drone used for advanced flight combat training. It was larger, smarter, and more heavily armored than the basic Amazon drone. As with the basic Amazon, these are now encountered only in the virtual battlefields of the TSM training module series. The Model VII is used to simulate assaults on enemy capital ships, training fighter and bomber pilots to target turrets and ship subsystems. Command has found that virtual training against Model VIIs increases the survival rate of pilots by 37% when attacking capital ships."

3037, "The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Triton Dynamics designed the Hygeia class with huge cargo bays for munitions storage, plus the latest magnetic-stasis delivery system for quickly re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3038, "The GTFr Triton hauls almost twice the tonnage of the Poseidon-class freighters that have served the Alliance since the Great War. The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTVA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

3039, "TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTVA reuses the containers in many capacities."

3040, "The GTFr Poseidon is the smaller of the two standard Terran military freighters. Though it carries only half as much cargo as the Triton, the Poseidon is more often chosen for dangerous missions. Its greater speed gives it better survivability on the front lines, as does the fact that it has four weapon turrets, compared to the Triton's two. When Allied Command sends supplies and munitions that have to get through, a Poseidon is usually chosen to transport them."

3041, "
The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTVA for deep space cargo transport. Its thin hull will preserve Terran-standard atmospheric conditions inside, as long as the hull seal has not been comprised by weapon fire or collision. TC 2 containers are cheap to manufacture and heavily used everywhere but the front lines (where the armored TAC 1 containers are employed, when available)."

3042, "
The TSC 2 container is armored, providing more protection for its cargo than does the TC 2. This armor serves mainly to protect against hull breaches due to collisions, as it's not thick enough to provide much protection against enemy attacks. TSC 2s are used in busy supply depots in which collision damage is a hazard."

3043, "The TAC 1 is a very heavily armored type of Terran cargo container. It is most often used to hold delicate or valuable cargoes. TAC 1s are generally found in front-line operations in which protection from enemy attacks is a primary consideration."

3044, "The TTC 1 is a civilian cargo container modified for military use. It is a dense-hulled container originally designed to protect fragile technical and scientific equipment. The same protection is now used to guard against collision and attack damage to replacement ship subsystems and other electronic equipment intended for combat spacecraft."

3045, "The GTC Fenris class is the aging stalwart among the Alliance's warships. Before the Great War, the Fenris was Terran Command's only class of cruisers. During the war, Terran Command decided to build a second line of cruisers, the Leviathans, to free the Fenris from escort and guard duties. Fenris cruisers have fought in virtually every theatre of operation. These fast, versatile cruisers pack enough punch in their 260-meter-long hulls to go toe-to-toe with any enemy cruiser. The Fenris's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for strike missions."

3046, "Terrans developed the GTM Hippocrates early in the post-war Reconstruction period. With the outbreak of the NTF insurgency, the GTVA has once again called the Hippocrates into active military service. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Allied-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach."

3047, "Early in the Great War, Han-Ronald engineers designed and built the Leviathan class of cruisers. The Leviathan is much heavier armed and armored than the Fenris, but also much slower and less maneuverable. Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations, where firepower is king and speed is of little importance. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. The Fenris is good for fast-moving operations, but when you need some muscle, call in a Leviathan."

3048, "The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines."

3049, "When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTVA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTVA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

3050, "Ships of the GTA Charybdis class have been packed with the latest tachyon-enabled AWACS equipment from GTVI labs. Each GTVA battle group has a squadron of Charybdis-class ships assigned to it. These ships double the range of the group's standard detection arrays. Charybdis ships' thin armor and weak defenses make them easy victims for enemy bombers. They have proven indispensable, however, in forays into the nebula beyond the Knossos portal. Charybdis-class ships are very vulnerable in this environment, as witnessed by the recent loss of the GTA Panopticon from the 3rd Battle Group."

3051, "For over 30 years, the GTD Orion class was the largest ship in the Terran-Vasudan armada. Over two kilometers in length, bristling with dozens of death-dealing turrets, the Orion is as awesome in repose as it is in battle. All GVTA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers. The Orion's cavernous hanger bays easily accommodate more than two dozen fighter or bomber wings."

3052, "The new GTD Hecate class of destroyers is replacing the Orion class as the flagship of Terran battle groups. More heavily armed than the Orion, the Hecate also carries over 150 combat spacecraft and a crew of 10,000. The GTD Aquitaine is a superb example of this new ship class, serving as the flagship of the Capella-based 3rd Fleet."

3053, "The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources."

3054, "The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

3055, "The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups."

3056, "Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet."

3057, "The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however."

3058, "The Iceni is the NTF command frigate, built under Admiral Bosch's direction at the Freedom shipyards in Polaris, captured by the Neo-Terran Front at the start of their rebellion.  With over two dozen turrets and a sheath of ultra-dense depleted uranium shielding around its subsystems, the Iceni is an extremely tough nut to crack. With Bosch on board, providing tactical guidance, the Iceni is the equal of any GTVA battle group. Intelligence believes the ship was custom-designed for a secret NTF project."

3059, "Hidden NTF asteroid base."

3060, "The GTT Elysium class of transports has been in service for over 40 years. Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class."

3061, "The GTT Argo has become the standard military transport vehicle for the Terran fleet. Argos sometimes carry new weapon and combat craft prototypes to and from testing grounds or to front-line deployment positions. Military VIPs occasionally commandeer Argos to travel from star system to star system in some semblance of comfort. Argos are most often used as assault transports, carrying squads of Marines through heavy flak to board enemy vessels that Command has decided to capture rather than destroy."

3062, "The GTI Ganymede is the Alliance's newest repair and resupply facility. Ganymede installations are currently deployed behind the front lines in the Vega, Vasuda, and Capella systems. Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTVA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

3063, "The subspace portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system in 2367. The interlocking circular motions of its components apparently create a subspace vortex that connects the Gamma Draconis system to another part of our universe.  Dr. Hargrove's team continues to study the device, though their findings are highly classified."

3064, "The GTSG Watchdog was the first generation of Terran sentry platform, the distant precursor to the Cerberus and Alastor platforms. Seriously underpowered by today's standards, the Watchdog also suffers from paper-thin armor. Many Watchdogs are Great War relics left active and in place because it wasn't worthwhile removing or deactivating them. The NTF occasionally uses stolen Watchdogs to guard supply depots or minor installations."

3065, "Until the advent of the GTSG Alastor, the GTSG Cerberus was the most advanced sentry gun emplacement available to Terran forces. They were vital to Terran defenses during the Great War, racking up over 100 kills of Vasudan and Shivan combat craft. But the current conflict has found them primarily in back-line roles, guarding installations deemed relatively safe from attack. With no mobility and only two Subach HL-7 turrets, they serve as more of a distraction than a viable threat to modern combat craft."

3066, "GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. Two Bessmer-Kohn cannon turrets on opposing sides of the platform give the Alastor a full field of fire. The turrets are controlled by the latest neural-net cyber-AI to track multiple targets simultaneously."

3067, "The GTEP Hermes escape pod is now standard equipment on every GTVA warship of cruiser size or larger. Each ship has several escape pods magnetically coupled to airlocks scattered around the ship's outer hull. Not intended for whole-crew evacuations, the Hermes has space for up to 20 crew members. Each pod is propelled by a small fusion engine, enough to remove the pod from the immediate vicinity of an exploding warship. It is also capable of subspace jumps."

3068, "The TC-Meson Bomb is used solely as a container for Meson Bomb deployments. Each is custom built specifically to hold a Meson Bomb. The container is permanently sealed once the bomb is safely housed within it."

When these shipyards were recaptured, the Thoth once again became an important component of the Vasudan navy.

3122, "The stealth prototype GVF Ptah was a top-secret development project assigned to Vasudan conglomerate Akheton Corp. Designed to be invisible to standard detection arrays mounted on combat craft, Ptahs have performed admirably during their OpEval period. The masking materials and blending technologies used across their outer surfaces seem to confuse Shivan detection systems as well. The Ptah is currently available only to select fighter units in the Vasudan navy, with no word on when they will be more widely distributed."

3123, "The GVS Nephtys is the Vasudans' new support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The high number of warheads carried by the Nephtys makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3124, "The GVT Isis is most often used as a military personnel transport but also occasionally serves as a repair ship or even a tugboat, helping to maneuver large vessels into docking bays. Two cannon turrets and thick molybdenum plating serve to protect its cargo. Magnetic cargo locks located on the Isis's undercarriage enable it to transport small cargo containers of supplies and munitions in emergencies."

3125, "The Ma'at freighter class has served the Vasudan navy for over 50 years. More than 200 of these vessels still serve the GTVA, carrying desperately needed supplies, foodstuffs, and munitions to every theatre of the war. With only three weapon turrets, a lone Ma'at is easy prey for a wing of enemy bombers. Thus Ma'ats usually travel in mixed convoys with other freighters, guarded by cruisers and fighter wings."

3126, "For the past 20 years, the GVFr Bes has been the mainstay of Vasudan shipping fleets. While some Terran systems languished in the post-war era, the Vasudans experienced an economic recovery that was miraculous, given the annihilation of their home planet. Experts credit the policies of the restored Imperial government that emerged following Khonsu II's dissolution of the Vasudan parliament. As commerce among the Vasudan systems resumed and expanded into Terran worlds, a new generation of space-faring cargo vessels was required to meet the needs of this burgeoning economy."

3127, "The Vasudan VAC 5 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3129, "When the first Satis-class freighter was encountered by Terran forces during the Terran-Vasudan War, its firepower led Terran Command to classify it as a light cruiser. Only after a disabled Satis was captured did its true nature become known. Now designated the GVFr Satis class, these freighters still serve as an iron fist within the velvet glove of a freighter convoy. Few enemy fighters who mistake a Satis for a Ma'at or Bes live to regret their error."

3130, "The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet."

3131, "The GVC Aten is among the smallest of the GTVA's cruiser classes, with thin armor and only a few, relatively weak turrets. Terran fighters and bombers exploited these weaknesses during the early years of the Great War, when the Terrans and Vasudans were still enemies. The Aten is most often seen in the current conflict as a rear-guard defense for convoys or installations, backing up wings of fighters and bombers."

3132, "The GVC Mentu cruiser is the lightest of the new Vasudan warships. Following the Great War, allied scientists developed the beam cannons that now serve as the primary armaments of today's GTVA warships. Rather than modify existing ships, the Vasudans developed new designs to mount these weapons. The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi."

3133, "Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves."

3134, "The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice."

3135, "The GVSG Ankh sentry gun platform is the Vasudan equivalent of the GTSG Watchdog. Both are Great War relics that perform poorly by modern standards. The Ankh serves to guard back-line storage depots and installations. With no armor or shielding, the Ankh is easily destroyed. Its two small turrets can deter unarmed raiders or badly damaged fighters, but it poses little threat to most combat craft."

3136, "When the GTVA asked the Vasudan navy to upgrade the Great War-era Ankh sentry gun platform, the GVSG Edjo was the Vasudans' answer. The Edjo has significantly more armor plating than the Ankh, improving its survivability, but the Vasudans placed only one small cannon turret on the new platform, giving it half the punch of the Ankh. After seeing the Edjo, the Terrans quietly began developing their own advanced sentry gun platforms. The Vasudan navy seems content to leave this aspect of military technology to the Terrans."

3137, "The GVEP Ra escape pod has been the standard emergency vehicle on Vasudan capital ships since the Terran-Vasudan War. In keeping with Vasudan philosophies, the Ra is almost never used to evacuate personnel, but instead is employed to preserve records and other data that could be of use to the allies. Thus Ra-class craft have minimal life support systems and a small fusion engine. The energy supplied by the escape pod's powerplant goes almost entirely to powering the pod's homing beacon."

3138, "The GVA Setekh is the Vasudan class of AWACS vessels, comparable to the Terran GTA Charybdis class. Setekhs are smaller, less heavily armored, and have half the turrets of Charybdis ships. Despite these shortcomings, the Vasudan navy insists upon deploying Setekhs in Vasudan battle groups, claiming the Vasudan versions are more appropriate for their fleets. Setekhs' crystalline detection arrays provide their fleets with doubled radar range within the nebular region. Every Vasudan battle group operating in this theatre has a wing of Setekhs attached to it."

3139, "In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet."

3140, "The Shivan fighter class SF Dragon is a fast, extremely agile craft. Its twin lasers pack a deadly punch. The Dragon's weakness seems to be a thin hull. The trouble is that their speed and maneuverability make them extremely difficult to hit."

3141, "The SF Basilisk is a Shivan heavy attack fighter. Slow but heavily armed and well-protected, the Basilisk targets slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3142, "The Manticore fighter is the fastest known craft in the Shivan armada. With a single, powerful laser and two missile banks, it is a dangerous offensive weapon. Its Achilles' heel lies in its thin hull and weak shields. Manticores do not last long in dogfights against other fighters. They prefer to target bombers, which are nearly helpless against the Manticore's speed and weaponry."

3143, "The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3144, "The SF Mara class of Shivan fighters was first encountered by the GTC Vigilant while patrolling the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. All other information concerning the Mara is classified level Psi."

3145, "First encountered in Gamma Draconis, the SF Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly."

3146, "The SB Nephilim is the slowest of the Shivan bomber classes. These craft were first encountered during the Great War and are still found in many Shivan attack formations. Nephilims are heavily armored and shielded, enabling them to deliver their devastating payloads despite their lack of speed."

3147, "The SB Taurvi is a Shivan vessel that has only recently been encountered. The Taurvi is one of the weaker Shivan bomber classes, but still the equal of every bomber in the GTVA arsenal. Not as maneuverable as a Nahema, nor as tough as a Seraphim or Nephilim, the Taurvi appears to be a Shivan compromise between speed and power."

3148, "Either the SB Nahema class is a new Shivan bomber design, or the Shivans are finally taking the GTVA seriously and bringing in their best ships. The Nahema is considered to be the Shivan's most dangerous bomber. It has demonstrated the ability to outrun virtually every fighter in the GTVA fleet. Its powerful laser banks and high-capacity missile bays make it a threat to combat craft of all types, as well as to capital ships."

3149, "The SB Seraphim is a familiar foe to GTVA forces. They appear to be similar to Nephilims in speed, armor, and shield strength, but have demonstrated a larger bomb capacity."

3150, "Encountered on rare occasions since the Shivans first entered the Great War, the ST Azrael is the only known class of Shivan transport. Little is known about it even now, but it is believed to house many Shivans within its thin hulls. Since Azraels might be carrying Shivan pilots or other skilled crew members, it is always worthwhile to eliminate these lightly defended ships."

3151, "The SFr Dis class of freighters is smaller than the Asmodeus class and not as well armed. It is still much more dangerous to attack than the GTVA's Triton or Poseidon freighters, however."

3152, "The SAC 3 is the most common Shivan cargo container found thus far. Its thin plating is barely enough to maintain the interior atmospheric integrity against the vacuum of space. As no additional effort was made to armor these containers against attack, it is assumed that only items of low value or importance are carried within. Nevertheless, standing orders are to capture these containers at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3153, "The SFr Mephisto class is equivalent to the Dis class in size and combat capabilities. Given their wildly different configurations, they must serve different purposes for the Shivans, but Allied Intelligence currently offers no further information on this matter."

3154, "The SC 5 class of Shivan cargo container is functionally identical to the SAC 3 class, as far as GTVA engineers have been able to determine. As with all Shivan cargo containers, standing orders are to capture at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3155, "Little is known about the SFr Asmodeus line of freighters. With a strong hull and four weapon turrets, they are the most dangerous Shivan freighters to attack. Nothing is known of the cargo Asmodeus freighters commonly carry."

3156, "The SAC 2 is a heavily armored variant of the standard Shivan cargo container. Equipment found in captured SAC 2s appears to be more fragile than that found in the more common SAC 3s. SAC 2 cargo containers are to be captured rather than destroyed at every opportunity. If the choice is between destruction and allowing the container to be recovered by Shivan forces, pilots are authorized to destroy the container."

3157, "The SC Lilith class of Shivan cruisers is a far-deadlier foe than the Cain class. Nearly impenetrable armor plating enables it to withstand tremendous punishment, enabling its nine turrets to lash out at warships and combat spacecraft with impunity."

3158, "Though not as thickly armored as the Lilith class, the SC Rakshasa class of Shivan cruisers is far deadlier. With over a dozen turrets, the Rakshasa is the most heavily armed Shivan cruiser class. It was a Rakshasa cruiser that destroyed the GTC Vigilant at the Gamma Draconis node in the Capella system."

3159, "The weakest of the Shivan cruiser classes is designated SC Cain. These vessels were commonly encountered during Great War battles. Cains are considered to be slightly stronger than the GTC Fenris cruiser class."

3160, "The SD Demon class of Shivan destroyers is much smaller than the Lucifer class but very heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Demons are known to carry numerous wings of fighters and bombers."

3161, "The SD Ravana is a destroyer class GTVA forces have only recently encountered. It appears to be tasked with clearing out smaller foes, a mission for which it is well suited. It eagerly wipes out wings of fighters and bombers and also overwhelms cruisers and corvettes."

3162, "The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion."

3163, "The SSG Trident line of sentry gun platforms is well known from numerous encounters during the Great War. These are still used to guard Shivan installations, but many of the stronger Belial platforms have been deployed to the most critical defensive positions."

3184, "The Great War"

3185, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

According to declassified transmissions, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

3186, "Reconstruction"

3187, "By the end of 2335, the Great War was over. The victory over the Lucifer had dealt the decisive blow. Incapable of coordinated strikes or strategic planning, the Shivans were outmaneuvered, isolated, and gradually destroyed. However, both species faced the challenge of rebuilding their interstellar societies from the ground up.

An ill-fated coup d'etat, orchestrated by the rogue intelligence branch of the GTA, marked the beginning of post-war factional politics. With its economy in ruins and political structures in turmoil, the Galactic Terran Alliance disintegrated into semi-autonomous regional blocs, each with its own agenda. The major entities included the Adhara Coalition, the Antares Federation, the Regulus Syndicate, and the Luyten New Alliance. As these groups consolidated and stabilized, the reconstruction gained momentum, and the resumption of open commerce rekindled the notion of a pan-Terran community.

Despite the annihilation of all life in their home system, the success of the Vasudan reconstruction surpassed that of their Terran allies. The Vasudans were governed by a Parliament until 2339, when the Vasudan Emperor, Khonsu II, dissolved this body and formed a new government, bringing an end to an institution notorious for its Byzantine treachery, corruption, and arrogance. The heir of a 10,000 year dynasty, Khonsu distinguished himself as a leader of unusual acumen and wisdom. Economists credit the Khonsu regime for the miraculous rehabilitation of Vasudan industry and society."

3188, "GTVA"

3189, "The Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA) was formed in 2345, ten years after the Great War. This treaty organization recognized the autonomy of its constituents as it provided a framework for trade and mutual defense. The Great War had transformed the enmity between Terrans and Vasudans into a lasting fellowship.

As the industry and economy of the Terran-Vasudan systems recovered, support for a more powerful GTVA gained momentum. In 2358, delegates signed into existence the Beta Aquilae Convention (BETAC), named after the system where the constitution was drafted and ratified. BETAC dismantled the governments of the Terran blocs and recognized the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Vasudan Imperium as the supreme authorities of Terran-Vasudan space.

Under BETAC, the Vasudans and the Terrans maintain separate fleets under a single command structure. A warship is designated GT or GV, indicating whether it is Galactic Terran or Galactic Vasudan. The two species openly exchange information and technology, and the most recent fighters and bombers can be modified to accommodate pilots of either species.

Technically, BETAC is but one of a series of conventions and treaties that define how the GTVA functions as a political, military, and economic entity. However, the significance of BETAC as the cornerstone of the Terran-Vasudan alliance has made it the favored target of NTF propagandists."

3190, "Earth"

3191, "In 2335, the destruction of the Lucifer superdestroyer collapsed the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis, severing all contact with Earth.

The fate of the Terran home planet remains open to speculation, though a number of scenarios are possible. As the center of an interstellar community, Earth could not survive in isolation without a radical transformation of its political and economic structures. On this point, there is no disagreement. However, the question remains whether this transition occurred peacefully or whether Terran society collapsed into anarchy. Strong arguments have been advanced for both sides.

For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation-states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society.

Though necessity has diminished Earth's practical importance in the post-war era, discovering the means to return home remains a high priority."

3192, "Neo-Terran Front"

3193, "Eighteen months ago, Admiral Aken Bosch, commander of the GTVA 6th Fleet, launched a violent military coup in the Polaris system. Within weeks, a regional domino effect also toppled the governments of Regulus and Sirius, all swearing allegiance to Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front.

Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra informs the ideology of his movement. Though Terrans have lived in exile from Earth since the end of the Great War, Bosch imagined a utopia that would restore the grandeur of the lost world. As the people of Earth once relied on Polaris to help them navigate the seas, the North Star would become the spiritual and political compass for Terrans of the new era. Bosch's message had a profound impact on the so-called Lost Generation, born during the post-war Reconstruction. The Neo-Terran Front provided the youth of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius with a cause to fight and die for.

Bosch succeeded because his pro-Terran ideology was explicitly anti-Vasudan. The NTF opposed any Terran-Vasudan alliance and called for the dissolution of the GTVA. The NTF core systems had suffered political and economic chaos throughout the post-war Reconstruction. The Vasudans' miraculous recovery under Khonsu II's leadership embittered those Terrans still struggling to rebuild their own systems. Bosch exploited this anti-Vasudan sentiment to achieve his own political ends."

3194, "Vasudans"

3195, "The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. Thirty years of peaceful interaction between Terrans and Vasudans has helped to deconstruct these stereotypes.

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device is standard on all GTVA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other.

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War. After the defeat of the Shivans, the Vasudans insisted on maintaining this convention. The Emperor strongly identified with the history of Ancient Egypt, particularly the longevity of its civilization. Following their Emperor's example, Vasudans will take on what they call a Terran name from the myths and history of Ancient Egypt."

3196, "Hammer of Light"

3197, "The dark side of the Vasudan obsession with history was the emergence during the Great War of Hammer of Light (HoL), a cult that gained a strong following among the PVN, resulting in defections to the HoL cause. The HoL believed the Shivans were the cosmic redeemers and destroyers predicted in obscure prophecies written thousands of years ago. Following the destruction of the Lucifer, the ideology and activities of Hammer of Light shifted.

While some followers committed ritual suicide, the military branch of the movement continued their armed opposition to the Vasudan government and its alliance with the Terrans. Though they continued to espouse HoL's religious dogma, their activities turned more toward acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare. This branch of the HoL was later crushed in Operation Templar, following the HoL's kidnapping of the Vasudan admiralty. Other HoL leaders vanished into obscurity, returning to the study of arcane texts. A number of these religious leaders were apprehended and imprisoned for their role in the insurgency, though a few are still in hiding."

3198, "Shivans"

3199, "32 years after the Great War, we still know almost nothing about the Shivans. 

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and all research on live specimens ended with the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. The results of these studies remain highly classified.

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. The most convincing evidence supporting this theory is the behavior of Shivan forces following the destruction of the Lucifer, the turning point of the Great War. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date."

3200, "The Ancients"

3201, "During the Great War, as the annihilation of Earth seemed imminent, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization we now call the Ancients. Data excavated at the site enabled the allies to track and destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace.

After the Great War, scientists uncovered more sites throughout Terran-Vasudan space. Though only fragments remain, this interstellar society thrived thousands of years ago. Their empire was more expansive than the current boundaries of known space, and archeologists believe they might eventually uncover a map of the Ancient nodes, enabling the Alliance to travel to systems previously uncharted. 

There is virtually no visual record of this civilization, except hieroglyphic forms discovered at the archeological sites and a handful of technological schematics. Major excavations are underway in Altair, Aldebaran, and Deneb, but the data gathered there remains classified at the highest level. 

Terran archeologists use a Minoan naming convention to identify sites and major artifacts. Current evidence suggests the Shivans exterminated this civilization over eight thousand years ago. The Ancients believed the Shivans were a race of cosmic destroyers, and that the extinction of their species was an act of retribution for striving beyond their ordained place in the cosmic order."

3202, "Subspace"

3203, "In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."
