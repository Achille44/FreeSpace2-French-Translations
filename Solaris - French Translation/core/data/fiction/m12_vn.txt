MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5040 "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU" 5069
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Welcome aboard, newcomer! Please take a moment to read through this orientation guide to familiarise yourself with the Hoshikuzu and her crew." 5070 "12a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "The Hoshikuzu is a one-of-a-kind corvette that started life as a Rasputin-class transport before being sold for scrap." 5071 "12a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "She was salvaged and converted into an armed corvette by Katherine Lau, her current captain." 5072 "12a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Her reactor and impeller was replaced with a military-grade unit, and her engines operate at more than two hundred percent efficiency. She is a hare with a lion's heart." 5073 "12a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Along with her new 40mm chaingun PDCs, she carries two gunships and several repair drones for support." 5074 "12a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Katherine Lau is the ship's captain. She decides who joins and leaves the ship. All who work hard are welcome. Those who misbehave are asked to leave." 5075 "12a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Derek Kaur is the ship's mechanic and keeps the power running. He's a Great War veteran, and he loves only vodka more than machines." 5076 "12a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Verma Erikson runs tactical and weapons. She's a mystery but no one knows guns better than her. If you manage to find out anything about her past, share it with me." 5077 "12a-08"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Dodo Meiks is one half of the gunship pilot team. He's a Caledonian through and through and is the only one that can match Kaur drink for drink." 5078 "12a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Finally there's Stuart Ross, the other gunship jockey. He's a bit of a lone wolf, but you can always expect him to speak his mind." 5079 "12a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "I hope your time aboard the Hoshikuzu is a positive experience. If you have any questions about this orientation guide, just send over a comms." 5080 "12a-12"

MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5040 "DEREK KAUR - HOSHIKUZU" 5081

MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "Hello Ross. Derek Kaur, ship's engineer. I helped Lau outfit the Hoshikuzu with the new reactor." 5083 "12a-13"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "As a reward Lau now has me running double duty on reactor and gunship maintenance. I'm in charge of keeping your craft maintained and repaired." 5084 "12a-14"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "I don't know if Lau told you. I used to serve in the Sinarus Combine navy. I was a flight deck engineer on an aviation frigate during the Great War." 5085 "12a-15"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "I also know relations between our nations are strained. It's no matter. Sinarus, Alban, on this ship all are brothers. Leave the politics to the politicians." 5086 "12a-16"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "Your gunships are interesting machines. I've modified their weapon mounts to accept most weapon systems out there. That should increase their potential firepower." 5087 "12a-17"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "Right now we are limited to basic equipment. I expect things will change when we get access to more advanced weapons." 5088 "12a-18"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5082 "That's all I wanted to say for now. I'll let you know once we get better equipment." 5089 "12a-19"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Hey Meiks, Ross. Look who's just scored our first contract?" 5090 "12a-20"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Our client is Trinity Holdings, a major trade cartel headquartered here at Azar station. They've posted out a contract to investigate a distress call from one of their freighters." 5091 "12a-21"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "The call came from the Compass Rose, a cargo freighter enroute to the Multnomah system. She dropped out of hyperspace with an unspecified 'engine failure'." 5092 "12a-22"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "The Compass Rose dropped out near several star systems with known pirate activity. She's a sitting duck for vultures looking for easy prey." 5093 "12a-23"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "No details on what to expect, but the Hoshikuzu and your gunships should have more than enough firepower to deal with any raiders we're likely to encounter. Your gunships are fully stocked with kinetic rounds and missiles." 5094 "12a-24"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Our mission is to safeguard the Compass Rose and her cargo while rendering assistance to her crew." 5095 "12a-25"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "This is going to be your first outing with us, so I'll go through the game plan once more before we head out." 5096 "12a-26"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Your gunships are too small to have their own hyperspace impeller, so you two will ride docked on the Hoshikuzu's fighter rails when we enter hyperspace." 5097 "12a-27"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "Once we enter the area, undock your gunships from the Hoshikuzu to initiate flight operations." 5098 "12a-28"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 2899 "You'll be weapons free after that. Watch your fire though, the Hoshikuzu may be armoured but I don't want her to take any more damage than she needs to." 5099 "12a-29"
