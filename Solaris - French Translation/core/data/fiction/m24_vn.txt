MSGXSTR "Ellis" 7270 "It's been a while since Aria's had a seconded fighter pilot. We appreciate it every time. Aria's combat ability goes up by an order of magnitude, and the crew enjoys seeing a new face." 7272 "24a-33"
MSGXSTR "Ellis" 7270 "Coming to a new environment is always a challenge, more so if there's no one else like you around. 'The navy pilot career burns bright and short,' and you're a beacon shining bright in the sterile monotony of ship duty." 7273 "24a-34"
MSGXSTR "Ellis" 7270 "Being Aria's pilot doesn't have to be lonely. Get to know the crew. Ensign Holmes on tactical is dying to ask you questions. Share piloting experiences with helmsman Ryan. Show them the type of person you are, and let them do the same for you." 7274 "24a-35"

MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "If you're not familiar with either craft, I suggest you study their technical schematics before choosing your loadout. In brief, the Lightning is a high performance hit-and-run interceptor, but the slower Raptor has an extra railgun bank and increased armour." 7287 "24a-29"
