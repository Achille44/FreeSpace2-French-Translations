4018, "Alright, there are no more Shivans here."

4019, "These bastards won't threaten the Fleet anymore."

4020, "That's all of them."

4021, "All red bastards destroyed."

4022, "This sector is now free of Shivans."

4023, "All Shivan forces are down. Area is secured."

4024, "Good fight, Outsiders. Area has been secured."

4025, "Alright, all the bastards are gone. Stay frosty, men!"

4026, "Aw, that's all of them? I was just beginning to warm up."

4027, "All Shivan forces neutralized. Let's hope they'll give us a moment of peace now."

4028, "Easy, boys. That's all of them."

4029, "All hostiles eliminated."

4030, "All enemy forces are down, wingmaster."

4031, "We gave the bugs a good lesson this time."

4032, "Woah, finally, we've dealt with all of them."

4033, "Area is clear, wingmaster. We have beaten all our foes this time."

4034, "The area has been secured, wingmaster."

4035, "More insects incoming!"

4036, "Wake up, folks! My sensors are picking up incoming Shivan forces!"

4037, "IFF confirmed! We've got more red bastards here!"

4038, "Shivan forces approaching!"

4039, "Warm up your guns, people! I've got Shivans on my sensors!"

4040, "Reading incoming jump signatures. IFF hostile!"

4041, "To arms, men! The enemy is approaching!"

4042, "Hostile contacts on scope! Enemies of Earth have arrived!"

4043, "New contacts on scope! Shivan forces incoming!"

4044, "Heads up, people! More Shivan forces are inbound! We've got work to do!"

4045, "More buggies are inbound!"

4046, "Watch out, we've got incoming!"

4047, "Alright, everyone, stay together! We've got company!"

4048, "Oh, damn it... Watch out, everyone! We've got visitors!"

4049, "Well, well, more bugs are here. Let's give them the greeting they deserve!"

4050, "Warm up your guns, people! More fucking insects inbound!"

4051, "By Allah! More enemies inbound!"

4052, "Oh no, not again! Shivan wings incoming!"

4053, "Detecting hostile jump signatures. New threat on scope."

4054, "Reading hostile signatures, wingmaster."

4055, "We'll take revenge for Sol!"

4056, "For the Fleet!"

4057, "Target aqcuired, wingmaster. Beginning attack!"

4058, "Yes, sir. I shall smash these bastards!"

4059, "I see it! Attacking now! For the Syndicate!"

4060, "Affirmative, wingmaster. Moving to attack!"

4061, "Commencing attack on your target, wingmaster!"

4062, "Locking on to the Federation's enemies. Moving to engage."

4063, "Yes, sir. We'll take them down! For Earth and the Federation!"

4064, "Are you trying to give me orders!? Oh, screw this, I'm on it."

4065, "They're already dead, Spark!"

4066, "I'm on it, wingmaster!"

4067, "I thought you'd never say that. I'll take them down!"

4068, "Roger that! I'll take them down!"

4069, "As you wish, wingmaster. Targeting the enemy."

4070, "Hah, hold on, Spark, I got this."

4071, "Acknowledged. Moving to engage."

4072, "Sure, Spark. I'll handle this... I think... "

4073, "Enemy of Earth in range. I will eliminate the threat."

4074, "Yes, sir. I will do what I can."

4075, "Yes, sir. Beginning my attack run! For the Syndicate!"

4076, "Copy that, wingmaster. Engaging your target"

4077, "It seems like you aren't tough enough to make it alone. Reinforcements are ready to save the day!"

4078, "Support fighters have arrived, wingmaster. Waiting for orders!"

4079, "Wingmaster, reinforcements are now in position!"

4080, "Reinforcements have arrived. Give us some Shivan asses to kick, sir!"

4081, "Additional forces are now under your command, wingmaster. Awaiting orders."

4082, "Ready to provide support. Please transmit orders."

4083, "Soldiers of Earth, ready to assist. Just tell us where to strike."

4084, "EFN fighters in position. Give us the targets!"

4085, "Stop crying, kids! Black Widow is here! Where's the enemy?"

4086, "Beta wing here, wingmaster. What's going on?"

4087, "Beta wing ready to send some insects to hell. What's your status?"

4088, "Beta wing ready to provide more firepower."

4089, "Beta wing ready. Did you wait for us?"

4090, "Woah, what a mess! Beta wing awaiting orders."

4091, "This is Beta wing. Waiting for orders."

4092, "You've got some bugs on your six, wingmaster!"

4093, "Shivan on your tail!"

4094, "Watch your back, wingmaster!"

4095, "Turn around and shoot that Shivan bastard on your tail!"

4096, "Watch out, pilot, you've got hostiles behind you!"

4097, "Watch your six, pilot, you've got a hostile on your tail!"

4098, "Watch out, kid! You've got a Shivan on your tail!"

4099, "Behind you, Spark!"

4100, "Spark, you've got one right behind you!"

4101, "Watch your six, Beta lead. There's a buggie going straight for you!"

4102, "Spark, behind you! A Shivan's coming straight for you!"

4103, "Watch yourself, Beta one. Behind you!"

4104, "Spark, watch out! There's a buggie on you!"

4105, "Beware, wingmaster, hostile behind you."

4106, "Spark, watch out! They're coming after you!"

4107, "Check your six, outsider. You definitely got their attention."

4108, "Bugs on your six, wingmaster, evade, evade!"

4109, "Oh no! Oh shi--"

4110, "God, help me!"

4111, "Fuuuuuuck!"

4112, "Remember me, pilots!"

4113, "Oh no! Oh no! Noooo!!!"

4114, "Long live the Syndicate!"

4115, "Oh, fuuuuuuck!"

4116, "For Earth!"

4117, "See you in hell, you bastards!"

4118, "Oh, dammit! There are too many! Oh, fuuuuuck!"

4119, "Oh no! They're on me! I can't-- No!!!"

4120, "Remember me, boys! I took a lot of these bastards with me!"

4121, "Heavy damage! I'm not gonna make it, wingmaster!"

4122, "Oh no! They got me! Nooooo! "

4123, "This is Delta wing. Ready to assist."

4124, "Did someone call Delta wing?"

4125, "Delta wing reporting in and awaiting orders."

4126, "This is Delta wing. Where are the Shivans?"

4127, "Delta wing here. We're eager to smash some Shivans!"

4128, "Delta wing is ready to assist, wingmaster."

4129, "This is Delta wing. What are your orders?"

4130, "Yes, wingmaster. I'm returning to the Fleet."

4131, "Right...let's get the fuck out of here!"

4132, "Roger that, Wingmaster. Drinks are on you tonight!"

4133, "Just in time. Jump drive engaged."

4134, "Acknowledged. Returning to the Fleet now."

4135, "I copy, pilot. Leaving the field of engagement now."

4136, "Order accepted, pilot. Returning to base."

4137, "You say you wanna do the job all by yourself, kid? Alright, just don't call me when you get in trouble."

4138, "Are you kidding me, Spark? Leave? But we still have Shivans to kill! "

4139, "If you say so, wingmaster... Returning to the Fleet now."

4140, "You're sending me away? Right, let's see how you handle this yourselves, boys."

4141, "Acknowledged. I'm returning to base."

4142, "Yes, wingmaster. I'm returning to base."

4143, "Roger that, wingmaster. Disabling your target."

4144, "Yes, sir! We will smash their engines!"

4145, "You outsiders occasionally have good ideas. Targeting the engines now."

4146, "Roger that, pilot. I'll take down the engines."

4147, "So you want me to fuck the bitch in the ass? I'm on it, kid."

4148, "Hit the engines, then finish off the bastard. That's too easy, Spark."

4149, "Copy that, Spark. I'm disabling your target."

4150, "Good call, Spark. We'll take down the engines."

4151, "I copy. Disabling your target now."

4152, "On it, Beta lead. Going for the engine."

4153, "Go for the engines? Got it, Spark. Consider it done."

4154, "Acknowledged. I will disable this target."

4155, "Alright, Spark, I'll destroy the engines."

4156, "Good strategy, outsider. Targeting the engines."

4157, "Sure thing, Spark. Going after the engines."

4158, "Alright, that sounds good. Targeting weapon systems."

4159, "Copy that, pilot. Moving to destroy the enemy weapons."

4160, "Good idea, kid. Guns are usually the most dangerous part of the ship."

4161, "You don't have to tell me twice, Spark. I'm targeting their guns."

4162, "Yes, wingmaster. I'll destroy the weapon subsystem."

4163, "Alright, Spark. We'll disarm your target."

4164, "I'm on it. Locking on weapons and firing."

4165, "Got it, Beta 1. Targeting their weapons."

4166, "They can't kill you if they have nothing to kill you with, right?"

4167, "Going for the turrets at once, Spark."

4168, "It'll take a while to destroy all these turrets... but I'll try."

4169, "Agreed, Beta lead. We will pacify this enemy so it cannot strike back."

4170, "Alright. I'll take down these turrets."

4171, "For Europa!"

4172, "They will burn, wingmaster!"

4173, "This one first, the others very soon..."

4174, "For the Exodus Fleet!"

4175, "Sol shall be avenged!"

4176, "I've got a visual on hostile forces. Moving to engage now."

4177, "Enemies of Earth straight ahead. Engaging."

4178, "Alright, men, you know what to do! I wanna see those bastards dead!"

4179, "Kill everything in range, you say? I love it!"

4180, "I'm right there with you, Spark. Engaging the enemy."

4181, "I hear you, Spark. Engaging the Shivan forces now."

4182, "Orders received, sir. Engaging the enemy."

4183, "Got it, Beta 1. Engaging hostiles."

4184, "Alright, Spark. Engaging now."

4185, "Copy that. Engaging nearby hostiles."

4186, "Ok, Spark, I'm engaging now."

4187, "Engaging enemy on your order, Beta lead."

4188, "Ok. I'll engage them."

4189, "The Syndicate shall not fail!"

4190, "Engaging now."

4191, "Epsilon wing ready to kick Shivan ass!"

4192, "Epsilon has arrived. Awaiting orders."

4193, "Epsilon here.  We're ready to kill some fucking bugs!"

4194, "Epsilon here. Where are the insects?"

4195, "This is Epsilon wing. What's your status, wingmaster?"

4196, "Gamma wing here. We're ready for action!"

4197, "Gamma wing is standing by. What are your orders, wingmaster?"

4198, "Gamma wing is now in system"

4199, "I can't hold these fucking bugs off much longer!"

4200, "Can someone kill that Shivan on my tail?!"

4201, "Help me, outsiders! They're all over me!"

4202, "Pilots, give me some cover! It's getting hot here."

4203, "It's getting damn hot out here! Someone wanna give your old boss a helping hand!?"

4204, "Not that I need help actually... oh fuck, now I need help!"

4205, "I'm in trouble! Someone help me out!"

4206, "Give me some cover, guys! They're all over me!"

4207, "They're right behind me! Someone help me!"

4208, "Things're getting nasty! Someone wanna help me out?"

4209, "Never thought I'd say it but...I need help!"

4210, "By Allah! I have hostiles all around me! Requesting assistance!"

4211, "Oh no! They're behind me! Help me out, anyone!"

4212, "I'm badly outnumbered, outsiders! I could use some help!"

4213, "Multiple hostiles all around me. Someone help me!"

4214, "Yes, wingmaster!"

4215, "All yours, wingmaster. Good luck!"

4216, "After all this time, you still haven't gotten enough kills? Fine, take this one."

4217, "Copy that, pilot. This one belongs to you."

4218, "I got it. Everyone, hands off that target. The kid's gonna play hero."

4219, "Got too few kills, Spark? Alright, I'll leave you this one."

4220, "Copy that, wingmaster. This one is yours."

4221, "Hah, okay. This  kill is yours, Spark."

4222, "Ugh, fine. You can go kill that one yourself."

4223, "Here you go, Beta 1. This one's yours."

4224, "Better kill this one quickly before I get bored and do it for you."

4225, "Are you sure you want this one for yourself, Spark?"

4226, "Ok, this one's all yours."

4227, "Unnecessary recklessness. Losing tactical advantage. But if you insist... "

4228, "Ok, Spark. I'll leave this one to you."

4229, "Are you kidding me, wingmaster?. No way."

4230, "Sorry, wingmaster. Unable to comply."

4231, "With all due respect, wingmaster, every pilot in the Fleet would disagree."

4232, "Stupid outsider. How do you expect us to follow that order?"

4233, "What the hell are you talking about, kid?"

4234, "Are you kidding me, Spark?"

4235, "Uh, I can't do that, sir."

4236, "You're giving strange orders, Spark... I can't do it."

4237, "What the hell kind of order is that, Spark?"

4238, "Uh...what? I can't do that."

4239, "What the hell were you drinking today, Spark? And you didn't even invite me to join you. Pity."

4240, "I'm afraid I cannnot do this, Spark."

4241, "I'd really love to... but I can't."

4242, "How am I supposed to do that, outsider?"

4243, "That's ridiculous. How can I do that, Spark?"

4244, "Are you kidding me, wingmaster?"

4245, "Sorry, wingmaster. I am unable to acquire your target."

4246, "Confirm your target, wingmaster. I can't get a reading."

4247, "I'm not detecting any Shivans here."

4248, "There are no targets here, pilot."

4249, "Specify a valid target, pilot."

4250, "There's no Shivan bastards to shoot here, kid."

4251, "I'm always willing to shoot down a Shivan, Spark, but...where did you see him?"

4252, "There's no target here, wingmaster."

4253, "Are we fighting ghosts now?"

4254, "And where is that enemy you wish me to kill for you?"

4255, "Hey, do I look like a fuckin' Shivan?!"

4256, "This isn't funny..."

4257, "Back off, pilot! You're confusing me with the Shivans!"

4258, "You think that's funny, wingmaster?"

4259, "We detected friendly fire, Beta 1! Hold your fire!"

4260, "Didn't you notice the war is over, pilot?"

4261, "Hey, stop firing at me, pilot! We're on the same side now!"

4262, "Watch where you're shooting, kid!"

4263, "Hey, Spark! Drank too much last time? I'm not a fucking Shivan!"

4264, "Hey, hold your fire, Spark! It's me, Echo!"

4265, "Can't you tell me apart from the enemy, Spark?"

4266, "What are you shooting at, Spark? I'm not a damn Shivan!"

4267, "Hey, watch where you're shooting, Beta 1!"

4268, "What, can't you tell a Terran from a Shivan?"

4269, "Please watch your fire, Spark."

4270, "Hey, Spark, what're you doing?"

4271, "Are you missing the Rim Conflict that much, outsider?"

4272, "Hey, Spark! Your weapons can't be that inaccurate!"

4273, "Oh, shit! They killed Spark!"

4274, "They got Gibson! We will avenge you, buddy!"

4275, "Oh, no! We've lost Beta 1!"

4276, "We've lost our wingmaster!"

4277, "We will avenge you, Spark!"

4278, "Spark is down! Spark is down!"

4279, "Damn! Spark is down!"

4280, "Oh, fuck! They took down Spark!"

4281, "Oh no! Our wingmaster's down!"

4282, "Beta 1 is down!"

4283, "Oh no! We've lost Spark!"

4284, "Shit, we lost Beta lead!"

4285, "Hell, we've lost Spark!"

4286, "We have lost our brother Spark!"

4287, "Spark, no!"

4288, "We have lost Beta lead."

4289, "That was for Europa!"

4290, "One less threat against the Fleet."

4291, "The fleetmaster will owe us for this, wingmaster."

4292, "Another fuckin' insect down!"

4293, "Another Shivan dead. Only ten billion to go!"

4294, "Show us how it's done, wingmaster!"

4295, "Nice kill, wingmaster!"

4296, "Not bad for an outsider!"

4297, "Good kill. You are indeed a skilled pilot."

4298, "Good kill, kid!"

4299, "That bug felt it! Nicely done, Spark!"

4300, "Good kill, Spark!"

4301, "Not bad for a man."

4302, "They never learn..."

4303, "That must've hurt him..."

4304, "Yeah, and that's another fucking insect blown up to pieces. Pity there are so many more left..."

4305, "Praise Allah! That Shivan met his end!"

4306, "You got one!"

4307, "Effective elimination of another hostile."

4308, "Hah, you make it look so easy, Spark... "

4309, "That was for Rhea, you disgusting creature!"

4310, "One less threat against the Exodus Fleet."

4311, "I'm out of missiles! Support, I need help!"

4312, "Secondary banks empty... again. Support, you know what to do."

4313, "My missiles have run out! I need support now"

4314, "Ordnance depleted! Calling in support!"

4315, "Support, move your ass and bring me more missiles!"

4316, "I used far too many missiles... Support, I need your help!"

4317, "Secondaries are depleted. I need a support ship now."

4318, "Support, be so kind as to rearm my fighter, please."

4319, "Support, I need rearming! Hurry up!"

4320, "I'm out of missiles. Calling in support."

4321, "Calling support ship. I'll fight better with my ammo banks full and my hull patched up, right?"

4322, "Calling in support ship now."

4323, "Oh no, not again. Support, I need to rearm."

4324, "Secondary banks empty. I require a support ship."

4325, "I'm out of missiles. I need to replenish them if I'm to continue the mission."

4326, "Out of missiles again! Support, I need help!"

4327, "I've taken damage! Calling in support!"

4328, "Command, my subsystems are blown! I need a repair!"

4329, "This thing is barely holding together. Support, I need hull repairs!"

4330, "My subsystems are damaged! Calling in support!"

4331, "My systems have gone haywire! I need support!"

4332, "Support needed! My fighter is heavily damaged!"

4333, "This crate needs repairs now. Support, come and help me fix this!"

4334, "Damn it, I've got problems with my subsystems!"

4335, "Systems are malfunctioning. Support, I need help now!"

4336, "I'm having problems with my fighter. I wouldn't mind a support ship to repair it."

4337, "Calling in support! My fighter  needs repair!"

4338, "Hull's taken heavy damage. Calling in a support ship to patch it up."

4339, "Calling in a support ship. I'll serve the Syndicate better with my ammo banks full and my hull patched up, right?"

4340, "Requesting a support ship for repairs."

4341, "I don't like these red lights on my screen. Support, help me fix it!"

4342, "I've sustained heavy damage. Calling in support."

4343, "Stabilizers are failing. I can't fix them myself. Requesting field repairs."

4344, "My hull's taken damage! Calling in support!"

4345, "Command, systems are blown to hell! I need a repair!"

4346, "Let's focus on our objectives, wingmaster."

4347, "The Fleet might not approve of this, wingmaster."

4348, "You are deserting the field of engagement, wingmaster."

4349, "Wingmaster, that's against our mission directives."

4350, "You are abandoning the mission, outsider. Turn back!"

4351, "Where are you going, pilot? The target is that way."

4352, "You will die for that, you treacherous scum! "

4353, "We believed in you, wingmaster!"

4354, "You'll join the Shivans in hell, traitor!"

4355, "No one betrays the Fleet and gets away with it!"

4356, "You will pay for that!"

4357, "You disgrace your uniform, wingmaster!"

4358, "I'll kill you for that, traitor."

4359, "You're a traitor to the entire human race, you treacherous scum! You'll die for that!"

4360, "You went too far this time, outsider. I'll teach you a lesson."

4361, "You'll die for that, you treacherous scum! "

4362, "No one betrays the Syndicate and gets away with it!"

4363, "Sounds great!"

4364, "It will be done, wingmaster."

4365, "Cool!"

4366, "Sounds like my dream job!"

4367, "With pleasure, wingmaster."

4368, "I copy, pilot."

4369, "Alright, kid. I'll handle this."

4370, "On it, Spark!"

4371, "Copy that, wingmaster!"

4372, "I'll get it done, Spark."

4373, "Fine. I'm on it."

4374, "Got it, Beta 1."

4375, "Alright, I'll handle this."

4376, "Very well, Spark."

4377, "Don't worry, Spark, I'll do this."

4378, "Acknowledged, Beta lead."

4379, "Alright, Spark, I'm on it."

4380, "Hold on, wingmaster. I really wish my Centaur was faster than this."

4381, "Stand by, wingmaster. I'm on my way."

4382, "Support ship deployed, wingmaster. Please stand by."

4383, "Rearming complete, wingmaster. Now go and kill some Shivans!"

4384, "Rearming sequence aborted, wingmaster."

4385, "The Shivans have taken down our support!"

4386, "The Shivans have taken down our support ship!"

4387, "Sorry, wingmaster. All the ships of the Fleet are already engaged.  We are unable to provide you with any reinforcements."

4388, "  The Great War"

4389, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. Several artifacts found there explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

On March 29, 2335, the Lucifer entered the Delta Serpentis-Sol jump node. Thanks to the data discovered at Altair, a joint Terran-Vasudan taskforce was able to pursue it into subspace and launch an attack while it remained unprotected by its impenetrable shields. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

Although the mission was a success and the Lucifer was destroyed while entering the Sol system, the resulting explosion created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Delta Serpentis jump node, severing all contact with the Terran colonies beyond the Sol system."

4391, "    Thw Great Perseverance Plan"

4392, "The end of the Great War in 2335 marked the start of a new era for the Sol system. With all communication to the rest of Terran space severed, millions of people in the Sol system lost contact with their families in the Terran colony worlds. With fear of the Shivans continuing to grow, it became clear that the Galactic Terran Alliance needed to change radically to adapt to new circumstances. For the first few months however, the Earth-based GTA government concentrated on internal political reforms rather than restructuring the Alliance governmental and economic system as a whole. 

From an economic point of view, the highest price of the collapse of the Delta Serpentis node was paid by large Earth and Martian corporations including the Han-Roland Corporation, the Mesa Corporation and Triton Dynamics. They had been the corporations most strongly dependent on resources from other systems. Losing their supply routes to the rest of Terran space resulted in the loss of trillions of credits and forced them to reorganize their corporate structure and seek new resources. 

And they found them. Their attention, once focused on offworld colonies in Delta Serpentis, Beta Aquilae and other star systems, was now turned back to Sol's outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their numerous moons. Those corporations entered these new markets very aggressively and began construction of new colonies, mines and gas refineries. 

Their fast expansion, however, threatened the position of minor economic players still dominant in the Outer Rim, including Valhalla Shipyards, United Heavy Industries, Bamiyan Development Corporation and Massive Dynamics. Old and new corporations began intense competition for the most valuable sources of gas and minerals which quickly evolved far beyond standard free market rules. As Inner Rim corporations based on Earth and Mars eventually failed to dominate the Outer Rim, they requested aid from the GTA government still based on Earth. 

On January 11, 2338, the GTA announced a controversial Great Perseverance Plan (GPP) meant to respond to the political, economic and social consequences of the Delta Serpentis jump node collapse. The GPP was a 784-page-long document involving administrative reforms, military service reforms and other additional changes in a variety of areas. Its size, however, was intended to disguise its basic purposes: 

1. Grant corporations based on Earth and Mars exclusive rights to the most precious mineral sources in the Outer Rim;
2. Guarantee Earth and Martian corporations a primacy over Outer Rim corporations in all future spaceship construction programs;
3. Enforce massive resettlement actions from overpopulated areas of Earth, mainly African, Arabic and South-Asian regions, to the newly constructed colonies in the Outer Rim;
4. Centralize the structure of the Alliance Revenue Service and allow unrestricted taxation of Outer Rim colonies by the Earth-based GTA government.

It was later proven that the GPP was heavily influenced from strong lobbying by the Han-Roland Corporation. The other Inner Rim corporations' involvement in the GPP's legislation was never confirmed, but speculation about their influence in crafting the GPP continues to this day. 
"

4393, "    Tensions rise"

4394, "Enforcement of the GPP began on March 7, 2338 with the first corporate freighters arriving at their designated mining sites at Ganymede. Miners employed by Ganymede Works, a subcontractor for Valhalla Shipyards, were ordered to abandon their stations. Between March 7 and April 12, a total of 651 mining and gas extraction sites were taken over by Earth and Martian corporations following the first stage of the GPP. In most cases, the takeovers were carried out peacefully, although more than 50 incidents of violence did occur. 

In order to oppose enforcement of the GPP, Outer Rim corporations began suing the privileged Earth and Mars corporations and accusing them of unfair lobbying and corporate malfeasance. Protests also took place in major Outer Rim colonies as people expected the new employers to provide inadequate working conditions. These actions were for naught, however, as the GTA judicial bureaucracy dismissed the lawsuits and the protests swayed the opinions of virtually none of the GTA politicians. Meanwhile, several of those same GTA politicians began an organized campaign of propaganda against the Outer Rim corporations. Hobart Ericsson, the GTA's Secretary of the Treasury, accused the Outer Rim corporations of becoming 'a criminal syndicate that is destroying the stability of the Alliance and threatens our jurisdiction in the whole sector'. Almost fourteen months later, Secretary Ericsson's words would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

On May 1, 2338, the GTA announced a new warship construction program involving 12 new Orion-class destroyers equipped with a new generation of weaponry. As the GPP guaranteed, all of the construction contracts were given to corporations from Earth and Mars. Following further enforcement of the GPP, new taxes were introduced in Outer Rim colonies in order to meet the increased government expenditures. In fact, the Jupiter and Saturn colonies were required to pay Earth and Martian corporations to fund the construction of the new GTA fleet. 

The GPP brought numerous economic problems to the Outer Rim colonies. By the end of 2338, Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede were all struck by recession and unemployment following the shutdown of so many shipyards and factories and further tax increases introduced by the GTA government. Massive protests and rioting raged across the Jupiter and Saturn colonies and many of them were violently suppressed by GTA security forces and corporate mercenaries."

4395, "    Spark of rebellion"

4396, "
On April 15, 2339, one of Han-Roland's supply convoys was ambushed in the Asteroid Belt. All of the freighters in the convoy were hijacked while the entire escort was destroyed. There were no survivors. In the following month, eighteen more attacks occurred, all taking place beyond Mars and all involving targets connected with corporations based in the Inner Rim. A Han-Roland spokeswoman called the attacks 'an organized terrorist activity probably sponsored by Outer Rim native industry.' GTA High Command responded with the deployment of the GTD Holmgard, commanded by Admiral Marcus Rossendarch, to maintain the security of the Asteroid Belt supply routes. This move, however, did not quell the attacks, but only further inflamed tensions throughout the entire Outer Rim. 

On May 29, 2339, the GTA government declared martial law throughout the Sol system and accused Outer Rim corporations of supporting terrorist attacks. Marines were deployed throughout the largest Jupiter and Saturn colonies and corporate security forces demanded unrestricted access to all Outer Rim shipyards. More than 80 representatives of United Heavy Industries were arrested and interrogated. One of these UHI representatives, Robert Sharif, then made a sworn statement that UHI shipyards were secretly producing fightercraft for terrorist groups. (Though rumors claimed that Sharif had been forced to make that statement, it was never conclusively proven if Sharif's testimony was made under duress. Only a few days after making his statement, Sharif disappeared and was never heard from again.) The GTA used Sharif's sworn statement as a pretext to justify taking the Outer Rim shipyards by force. The GTD Salvation, under the command of Admiral Ivanov, was thus dispatched on June 1 to take over the Adamant Shipyard in high orbit over Europa. The shipyard's personnel refused to obey the order to stand down and evacuate. GTA boarding parties then tried to capture the shipyard by force, but met with armed resistance and were forced to withdraw. Although Ivanov had been ordered to capture the Adamant Shipyard intact, seeing his Marines repelled by a bunch of poorly armed, ragtag civilians so humiliated him that he commanded the Salvation to fire on the shipyard despite his orders. As a result, all of the 4,000 civilians onboard the shipyard were killed when the Salvation opened fire and a further 40,000 civilians died when debris from the destroyed shipyard impacted several of the cities of Europa below. (Ivanov was never punished or disciplined for firing on civilians.)

This tragic event turned out to be the spark of rebellion. Two days later, on June 3, 2339, leaders of the 19 largest colonies of the Outer Rim gathered at an undisclosed location on Europa and unanimously signed the Europan Convention. This document was a formal declaration of independence from the Galactic Terran Alliance and became the genesis of the Outer Rim Syndicate.

In response, later that very same day, GTA High Command issued emergency orders to the 1st Gaian and 2nd Martian Fleets to set out for the Outer Rim, join up with the 3rd Jovian Fleet and end the rebellion by any means necessary."

4397, "  The Secession War"

4398, "    Shifts of power"

4399, "FFollowing the proclamation of the Europan Convention, the rebellion began to spread throughout the Outer Rim. Mass protests and riots raged across the Outer Rim and armed resistance groups began taking over the seats of GTA governors and corporate offices. In some cases, mostly in small remote colonies, local authorities decided to surrender, flee or even join the protesters. In others, however, especially in strategically important mining sites on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, corporate security forces, determined to protect their employers' property from the angry crowds, responded with violence. This only further fueled the fire. Turmoil was also spreading among the personnel of the 3rd Jovian Fleet, the majority of whom had been born and raised in Outer Rim colonies. With open rebellion in the Outer Rim now a reality, the GTA saw no other choice but to wage open warfare to restore its authority. Naturally, many of the soldiers and sailors of the 3rd Jovian Fleet had no desire to go to war against their homes and families.

After the collapse of the Delta Serpentis node in 2335, the GTA had reorganized the Terran 1st Fleet of the Great War era into three separate units: the 1st Gaian Fleet guarding the core sector of Earth and Luna; the 2nd Martian Fleet securing Mars along with its moons Deimos and Phobos as well as the Asteroid Belt; and the 3rd Jovian Fleet stationed in high orbit above Jupiter, responsible for patrolling the Outer Rim sector consisting of the entire Sol system beyond the Asteroid Belt. The GTA's initial move of the Secession War was to deploy elements of the 2nd and 3rd Fleets into the low orbits of the rebelling colonies whose leaders had signed the Europan Convention. Their orders were to destroy or capture orbital defenses, major shipyards and primary industrial infrastructure, then deploy ground forces to take over the cities and arrest the leaders of the rebellion."

4400, "    Showing the cards"

4401, "Because of growing unrest among members of the 3rd Fleet who hailed from the Outer Rim colonies, the GTA created mixed taskforces consisting of both 2nd and 3rd Fleet elements and tried to perform shifts in command structure so that major operations in the forthcoming offensive would be performed by commanders of unquestionable loyalty. This move forced some pro-Syndicate officers to reveal themselves, beginning with Admiral Glenzmann, commander of the 3rd Fleet. Glenzmann's flagship, the GTD Lazarus, refused to submit to GTA military police officers and fired upon 2nd Fleet ships that arrived to take Glenzmann into custody. The Lazarus then defected to the Syndicate and became the ORD Lazarus, a destroyer in the newly-formed ORS fleet. Glenzmann's renouncing of the GTA was followed by defections of many 3rd Fleet cruisers, carriers and utility vessels, the commanders of which refused to fight against their own kin. Other loyalist purges turned out to be successful, however. One such purge involved GTA boarding parties successfully taking the GTD Adrasteia by surprise and relieved pro-Syndicate Admiral Thanou of his command. Admiral Ivanov, who had already proven himself loyal to the GTA at the Adamant Shipyard, became commander of the remaining pro-GTA elements of the 3rd Fleet.

Personnel shifts in the 2nd and 3rd Fleets delayed the execution of GTA High Command's standing orders. On June 6, 2339, elements of the 2nd and 3rd Fleets including the Adrasteia and the Salvation arrived at Europa, Io and Ganymede, but the colonies had used the delay to mobilize their local defense forces. Following heavy fighting, the GTD Salvation's taskforce obliterated Ganymede's orbital defenses and commenced orbital bombardment of the moon's largest industrial complexes, resulting in more than 300,000 dead. Europa's defenders suffered great losses at the hands of the Adrasteia's taskforce and Europa was very close to sharing the fate of Ganymede as a result. However, the tide of battle was turned by the arrival of the Lazarus and a large ORS flotilla formed from 3rd Fleet defectors. After taking critical damage, the Adrasteia was forced to withdraw from Europa, resulting in the first major, though costly, victory for the Syndicate. At the same time, Admiral Tessandras of the GTD Apam Nepatis, commanding the 2nd Fleet's taskforce dispatched to Io, switched sides. Instead of attacking Io's defenses, he struck at the remaining loyalist forces and decimated them, as treason was the last thing the loyalists expected from a ruthless Martian admiral. The outcomes of GTA incursions at the other colonies varied. The colonies that began preparations early enough were able to drive off the loyalist forces, but the vast majority of the rest were not prepared to confront regular military forces and could only evacuate and watch from a distance as their factories and shipyards were reduced to rubble. In total, GTA raids and bombardments resulted in more than 10 million casualties and crippled the infrastructure, defenses and industry of most Syndicate colonies except for Europa and Io."

4402, "    Path to unity"

4403, "The GTA offensive against the Outer Rim colonies was a major blow for the newly-formed Syndicate. Infrastructure damage ruined ORS plans of using small remote shipyards for decentralized construction of a new fleet to confront the GTA. 3rd Fleet defectors also took heavy losses in the colonies' defense. On the other hand, the scale of atrocities committed by the invading loyalist force resulted in further radicalization of Outer Rim citizens and brought even more volunteers under the Syndicate banner. The ORS was swamped with volunteers determined to avenge their friends and families killed in the bombardments. Outer Rim citizens were more than willing to fight; they only needed leadership and organization to form them into a force that could confront the powerful GTA. 

On June 13, 2339 all the signatories of the Europan Convention gathered at an undisclosed location on Europa once again; some arrived in person, while others, having to deal with the aftermath of their ravaged colonies, were only able to attend via holoconference. Accompanied by representatives of many colonies that did not initially join the rebellion but were now outraged by GTA crimes, they formed the Syndicate Magistratorium, a joint council of colony leaders, corporate officials and military officers united by their vision of an independent Outer Rim free of Earth's tyranny, oppression and economic exploitation. They appointed Admiral Glenzmann supreme commander of all ORS forces and gave him the task of creating a new unified command structure that would better suit the decentralized character of the ORS and its unconventional warfare style. Two fleets were formed under the commands of Glenzmann and Tessandras. Fleet commanders were now called “fleetmasters” and ship captains were renamed as “shipmasters;” the other ranks in the ORS military hierarchy were likewise changed to emphasize their much wider autonomy and responsibility than in the GTA fleet. Befitting Glenzmann's greater authority as the supreme commander of the ORS military, he was awarded the rank of high fleetmaster, while Tessandras, as his subordinate, was given the rank of fleetmaster."

4404, "    Striking back"

4405, "While Io and Europa were secure for the moment, other colonies still suffered greatly, either harassed by GTA raids or occupied by GTA ground forces. In order to maintain their war effort, the ORS began to upgrade old transports, freighters and miners into mobile production centers. The most successful redesign was the refit of the mining ship that became the ORFS Enutriet. In the following weeks a number of Enutriet-class factory ships began extracting minerals and gas throughout the Outer Rim, processing them into fuel, ammunition and spare parts, and delivering them straight to the warships and shipyards of the ORS. The ORS fleet at that time consisted mainly of Fenris- and Leviathan-class cruisers and Sagittarius-class light carriers that were reintroduced into service by the GTA shortly after the Great War. The fleet was soon strengthened by multiple refitted pre-Great War vessels that had been either docked idle near remote installations, used by local security forces or even already sent to ship graveyards waiting to be scrapped. Three Zagreus-class destroyers, the ORD Calixta, the ORD Enyalius and the ORD Leander, soon joined the Syndicate fleet, alongside 15 Atropos-class frigates and 40 Damocles-class cruisers. 

While High Fleetmaster Glenzmann was organizing the new Syndicate fleet, Fleetmaster Tessandras acted on his own initiative and took his fleet into battle, combining ORS guerilla tactics with his own combat experience from the Great War. He began aggressive hit-and-run attacks against GTA-controlled colonies and installations in the Outer Rim as well as GTA supply lines between Earth, Mars and Jupiter. The Asteroid Belt in particular became a site of several fierce battles between Tessandras' forces and the GTA taskforce commanded by Admiral Rossendarch of the GTD Holmgard. As both commanders possessed impressive tactical skills and unpredictable strategic acumen, this cat-and-mouse game lasted for almost two months and brought no decisive outcome. A major part of Tessandras' strategy involved deploying elite squadrons, such as the famous 199th Eviscerators, flying significantly upgraded Athena Mk II-class light bombers. Tessandras' attacks managed to keep Rossendarch and his forces at bay, thereby taking some pressure off Glenzmann's forces battling the loyalists across the Outer Rim. However, the Holmgard kept eluding Tessandras' traps and even managed to launch several impressive counterattacks. 

Once Glenzmann had finished gathering his forces, the ORS launched a large counter-offensive on August 15 to retake GTA-occupied colonies and convince hesitating, skeptical or threatened colonial governors to join their cause. The ORS taskforce joined up with local anti-GTA resistance forces, liberated Ganymede, Callisto and Rhea, and fought GTA forces at Iapetus and Titan. This ambitious offensive, however, spread the ORS forces too thinly and the GTA counterattacked. The Syndicate was forced to give ground at Iapetus and Titan, but managed to repel the GTA counterattack at Rhea. After holding and fortifying Rhea, the ORS successfully created a strong perimeter near Saturn. At the same time, local resistance forces grew stronger in the smaller colonies like Uranus' moon Ariel and Neptune's moon Nereid, so the GTA had to dispatch additional marine detachments to maintain their hold on those colonies. "

4406, "    Operation Punisher (1)"

4407, "At the beginning of September 2339, the Secession War was still far from concluded. GTA and ORS forces had fought to a stalemate. The Syndicate fortified its positions on Europa, Io, Ganymede and Rhea while the GTA's control remained secure on Titan, Iapetus and most of the moons of Uranus and Neptune. Fleetmaster Tessandras and Admiral Rossendarch continued to keep each other in check in the Asteroid Belt and neither could gain an advantage over the other. 

On September 4, Admiral Donathan Walker, an up-and-coming GTA officer, took command of the GTD Proteus and the entire 1st Gaian Fleet. He appeared before the GTA Security Council and presented a bold and audacious plan: Operation Punisher. Walker proposed to break the deadlock by dispatching the majority of Earth's defensive forces to aggressively hunt down the Lazarus, penetrate its perimeter over Europa, and commence bombardment of the Galilean moons. Unlike previous bombardments of the Secession War, Walker did not intend to make precise strikes against factories, shipyards and military bases. Instead, he planned to decimate the population of Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede with massive thermonuclear explosions and thereby discourage other colonies from continuing the war. Other GTA admirals opposed this plan not only for moral and humanitarian reasons, but also because it would leave Earth vulnerable to an ORS counterattack. In particular, Admiral Hector Caliphtys of the GTD Ironclad very loudly insisted on continuing the war of attrition and crippling ORS infrastructure rather than leave Earth unprotected. Walker, however, remained committed to his strategy. To ensure that Caliphtys could not interfere with its execution, Walker reassigned the defiant admiral to a flotilla stationed in Earth orbit as a reserve. With Caliphtys sidelined, there was not enough opposition to keep the GTA Security Council from approving Operation Punisher.

On September 20, final preparations to launch Operation Punisher were underway. The 1st Gaian Fleet had been ordered to strike simultaneously at Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede. Luckily, ORS Intelligence found out about the offensive only a few hours before it was scheduled to begin, allowing the ORS to withdraw ships defending Rhea and several other colonies and redeploy them around Jupiter. The Lazarus maintained its patrol over Europa, while the Calixta, the Enyalius and the Leander defended Io, Calypso, and Ganymede, respectively. When Fleetmaster Tessandras, still fighting Rossendarch in the Asteroid Belt, learned of the upcoming attack, he had the Apam Nepatis launch its fighters and bombers against incoming GTA forces while he ordered the destroyer itself to redeploy to whichever moon first needed reinforcement. As the ORS fleet rallied to stand against the GTA invasion, civilian liners, supply ships, miners and transports from all over the Outer Rim began rushing to Jupiter to evacuate the moons' civilian population. The threat of genocide, this time at the hands of their Terran brethren instead of by the Shivans, rallied the Outer Rim's citizens to a common cause.

As both sides rallied their forces, the fate of the Outer Rim hung in the balance."

4408, "    Operation Punisher (2)"

4409, "The GTA invasion force, consisting of almost the entire 1st Gaian Fleet and elements of the 2nd Martian Fleet, arrived at the four Galilean moons simultaneously at 07:43 hours on September 21. The GTD Proteus, the GTD Dauntless and a large flotilla of GTA warships engaged the ORD Lazarus-led defense force in close combat while GTA bombers, hoping to divert some ORS forces from the main fleet, attacked civilian convoys fleeing from Europa. The same strategy was used at Io, Calypso, and Ganymede as well. After a fierce engagement, both sides suffered 70% casualties. The GTD Dauntless was so badly damaged that it was forced to withdraw while the Proteus and the Lazarus gave each other a wide berth to continue fighting at long range.

Io became the first of the Galilean moons to fall to the GTA. Having destroyed the ORD Leander and its entire fleet at 08:50 hours, the GTD Salvation began firing upon the surface of the moon with thermonuclear bombs. Fleetmaster Tessandras dispatched the Apam Nepatis in a desperate push to prevent further bombardment. Despite heavy losses, bombers from the Apam Nepatis' 199th Eviscerators squadron destroyed the Salvation's missile launchers. The Apam Nepatis then managed to destroy the majority of the Salvation's escort ships. However, the Apam Nepatis was soon caught in a cross-fire when GTA reinforcements led by the GTD Holmgard arrived. The Apam Nepatis' jump drive was damaged and Tessandras, unable to retreat, put the Apam Nepatis on a collision course with the Salvation and ordered his crew to abandon ship. As Tessandras and his surviving crewmembers dashed to safety in their escape pods, the Apam Nepatis collided with the Salvation, resulting in the destruction of both ships as well as the death of the Salvation's commanding officer, Admiral Ivanov, the Butcher of Adamant Shipyard. Tessandras and his crew were quickly rescued by the rest of the ORS fleet. With his flagship destroyed and unable to hold the line at Europa any longer, Tessandras withdrew the remainder of his fleet to reinforce the crumbling defenses at Ganymede."

4410, "    Operation Punisher (3)"

4411, "The assault on Ganymede was led by the GTD Adrasteia. The ORD Calixta had been critically damaged while defending Ganymede alongside the remainder of its fleet when Tessandras' ships arrived. The remaining Eviscerators, along with fighter escorts from other squadrons, were sent to destroy the thermonuclear missile launchers on board the GTD Adrasteia. However, the Adrasteia's fighter screen was stronger than expected and the Eviscerators lost more than half of their squad members as well as all their escort fighters. The surviving Eviscerators were ordered to retreat but refused to withdraw and they continued pushing forward while surrounded by GTA fighters. The last three bombers, designated Falchion 2, Falchion 4 and Illusion 3, managed to reach the Adrasteia's missile launchers and destroyed them seconds before they were finally overwhelmed by the Adrasteia's fighter screen. 

(The 199th Eviscerators' ultimate sacrifice would be honored many years later when their squadron name was given to the BOD elite gunship squadron stationed on the ORD Vermillion.)

At 09:20 hours, after a hard-fought engagement at Calypso, the GTD Excelsior destroyed the ORD Enyalius and began bombarding the moon. The ORS' last reinforcements, led by the frigates ORFg Alexander and ORFg Antaeus, were deployed to destroy the heavily damaged Excelsior, but were stopped when the GTD Holmgard unexpectedly arrived from Europa. (No one is sure why Admiral Rossendarch chose to reinforce the EFN forces at Calypso rather than bombard a now-defenseless Europa, but some have theorized that he thought reinforcing the Excelsior was the greater priority since he could return to Europa at his leisure afterwards.) As a result, the Excelsior was able to bombard Calypso without interference. The moon's largest cities were completely destroyed, resulting in at least 128 million dead or missing, the greatest genocide committed by humans since the Unification Wars."

4412, "    Operation Punisher (4)"

4413, "At 09:40 hours, the Lazarus and the Proteus closed to within striking distance of each other over Europa once again. With both destroyers heavily damaged and their escort flotillas decimated, Admiral Walker called the GTD Ironclad and its fleet for help. After standing on the bridge of the Ironclad for hours hearing numerous reports of atrocious civilian casualties from the GTA bombardments of Io, Ganymede, and Calypso throughout the battle as well as the GTA attacks on civilian convoys at Europa, Admiral Caliphtys came to a sudden decision and ordered his fleet to leave its assigned position near Earth and jump to high Earth orbit. 

At 09:45 hours, the Ironclad and its fleet arrived in high Earth orbit at GTI Zion, the installation which housed GTA Headquarters and was presently hosting the members of the GTA Security Council who were monitoring the progress of Operation Punisher. The Ironclad destroyed Zion Installation with the entire GTA High Command and the whole Security Council on board.

At 09:55 hours, the Ironclad then arrived near Europa and outflanked the GTA invasion force. The Proteus lost all its remaining escort ships and was forced to retreat back to Earth orbit. At the same time, the Ironclad's fleet split into three units that separately arrived at the orbits of Calypso, Io, and Ganymede and engaged the heavily damaged GTA flotillas. Working together with the remaining ORS forces, Caliphtys and his forces destroyed the GTD Adrasteia and the GTD Excelsior and forced the GTD Holmgard to withdraw to Mars. 

Operation Punisher had finally come to an end."

4414, "    Aftermath"

4415, "With Zion Installation destroyed, Earth collapsed into political chaos. GTA High Command had been totally shattered. Several commanders of GTA forces tried to act independently and continue the invasion of the Outer Rim, but without coordination they were easily driven off by ORS forces. More and more colonies of the Outer Rim rebelled against GTA authority and joined the Syndicate. Admirals Walker and Rossendarch returned to their home planets and began regrouping what was left of the GTA fleet. Mars itself wasn't saved from political turmoil, as many poorer provinces like Hesperia, Nepenthe and Syrtis used this opportunity to secede from the GTA. Despite Martian local governments sympathizing with Outer Rim ideology, the Syndicate did not possess the means to reinforce Mars with ground troops to defend autonomous provinces from GTA counter-offensives. For this reason, the Martian secessionists did not join the ORS; instead, they proclaimed their neutrality from both the GTA and ORS until the differences between the two powers were resolved. Thanks to Rossendarch's political efforts, Mars' most resourceful regions remained loyal to the old order and even became the most active political players within the GTA, preventing it from total collapse. 

Although victorious, the newly independent ORS was devastated and exhausted. Thermonuclear bombardment decimated the population of Calypso and inflicted heavy damage to cities on Io. Less than 30 percent of ships created by or defected to the ORS survived the final stage of the war. The only destroyers left in the ORS fleet were the heavily damaged Lazarus and Calixta as well as the newly-joined Ironclad. Admiral Caliphtys sent his forces to secure the Outer Rim, look for survivors in bombed colonies and fight any GTA holdouts still remaining in the Outer Rim. Many ship captains from Earth and Mars, suffering from lack of supplies and without orders from GTA High Command, surrendered or defected to the Syndicate. On September 24, Admiral Caliphtys met with High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, Fleetmaster Tessandras and several Syndicate Magistrates to merge his forces with the ORS military and officially accept the rank of fleetmaster. Although his attack on Zion Installation over Earth generated a lot of controversy, many in the ORS agreed that his actions prevented further bombardment of the Galilean moons, saving millions of Outer Rim citizens and the Syndicate as a whole. 

On October 18, a summit was called at Covenant Installation, located in neutral territory at the edge of the Asteroid Belt. Among the participants were Admiral Walker of Earth, Admiral Rossendarch and Prime Minister Bryant representing Mars, with High Fleetmaster Glenzmann and High Magistrate Helena Smithson representing the Outer Rim. As both sides were unable to continue the war, they agreed to a ceasefire and set a demarcation line along the Asteroid Belt. The Covenant Treaty signed between the Galactic Terran Alliance and the Outer Rim Syndicate was in fact the first recognition of ORS independence from Earth's government. It would be 12 years before the GTA's successor state, the Earth Federated Nations (EFN), would attempt to restore Earth's control over the Outer Rim again."

4416, "  The First Interbellum"

4417, "    Post-Secession boom"

4418, "Freed from GTA rule, the Outer Rim entered a new era of economic growth. Far-reaching liberalization of economic policy combined with government help to regions struck by GTA bombardments allowed the colonies to recover from the war faster than anyone could have expected. Outer Rim corporations invested powerful financial and material resources in rebuilding Syndicate infrastructure and restoring the Syndicate's largest production centers. Two of the strongest participants in the reconstruction process were United Heavy Industries with a total expenditure of 118.8 billion credits between the years of 2339 and 2345 and Bamiyan Development Corporation with 61.4 billion credits spent during the same period. 

In exchange for their investments, several corporations gained a dominant position in Outer Rim markets and received government contracts on constructing new ships and military infrastructure. Shipyards around Jupiter and Saturn began mass production of the new Vitalius-class frigate, a fast, cheap and reliable frigate designed by Bamiyan Development Corporation that would form the mainstay of a new ORS fleet. 

Economic growth was followed by closer political integration of the Outer Rim. From a loose confederation and a military alliance of colonies dispersed throughout the Sol system, the Syndicate evolved towards a more centralized unified state. While respecting wide autonomy of the colonies' internal policy and their economic freedom, the Syndicate Magistratorium consistently acquired prerogatives over ORS' defensive policy, technological development, and maintaining diplomatic relations with a problematic neighbor -- first the GTA and later the EFN."

4419, "    Earth reborn"

4420, "After losing the Secession War and the destruction of Zion Station, Earth lost both its central government as well as its privileged position within the Sol system's balance of power. Administration of Earth's remaining colonies was taken over almost entirely by Mars' pro-GTA factions and military commanders like Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch. Earth's local factions, the boundaries of which mostly reflected pre-unification national borders, took over the administration of ‘internal affairs.' 

By the end of 2340, Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch had regrouped the remnants of the GTA fleet and secured the GTA's remaining territories, so they intensified efforts to reunite quarrelling factions of Earth and Mars into a new centralized government. On January 20, 2341, leaders of the American Conglomerate, the European Union, the Indo-Asian Confederation, the Republic of China and 25 other factions met in Shanghai and formed the Earth Federated Nations. In a 74-page-long document called the Charter of Federated Nations, they announced that it was 'high time for Earth's government to stop existing only theoretically' and that 'Grand Terra needs leadership that will not fail her as the GTA of old did'. The radical, nationalist, and xenophobic wording of the document was a harbinger of the EFN's authoritarian nature. Despite initial reluctance, pro-GTA factions of Mars eventually joined the EFN, sealing the reunion of old GTA territories. 

The new Earth government made far-reaching political, social and economic reforms, centralized government administration, created a new fleet command structure, and passed strict corporate laws. Old corporations like Han-Roland initially protested against the new regulations, but their losses were promised to be compensated by the new EFN fleet construction programs. These privileges turned out to only be a facade as the quickly expanding EFN police and security services began removing disobedient management under false charges and made the corporations totally dependent on government policy. Propaganda showed corporations as a public enemy to justify deeper and deeper state interventions. It was just the first step towards a total surveillance state that would later become a routine fact of life for EFN citizens. 

Government-dependent corporations directed huge funds to construct a new fleet for the EFN. New ship classes were introduced like the EFC Evangelist-class cruiser, the EFFg Solomon-class frigate and the EFCa Praetor-class battlecarrier. With its surveillance state and terror machine growing, the Federation began to close the power gap between itself and the Syndicate.

The EFN introduced a new militaristic doctrine that included mass conscription, universal military education in schools and emphasis on order, law, and public service rather than freedom as well as the needs of society rather than the needs of an individual. The EFN spread propaganda of the 'New Earth nationalism' proclaiming the superiority of the 'true sons of Terra' over societies of other worlds (with exceptions made for 'Earth's eldest children' -- Luna and Mars). To reflect this propaganda of favoring Luna and Mars alongside Earth, the EFN fleets were reorganized into the 1st Gaian, 2nd Lunar and 3rd Martian Fleets."

4421, "    Seeds of conflict"

4422, "In the late 2340s the ORS still benefited from the Post-Secession Boom and the EFN mostly restored its pre-Secession War economic potential. Since the end of the Secession War, the ORS and EFN maintained cool, if not overtly hostile, foreign relations (and even made a few bilateral trade agreements). As the Federation and the Syndicate continued to rebuild, however, the more hawkish factions in both states began to come to power. Shifts in government funding resulted in a rapid increase in spending on fleet construction, military infrastructure, and national security. 

It wasn't long before an arms race between the ORS and EFN resulted in growing unrest. An unfortunate chain of events took place between border outposts and patrols in the Asteroid Belt. Typically, a cruiser or frigate 'accidentally' fired upon the other side's convoy or a fighter wing got dangerously close to the demarcation line. 

The first serious incident happened on March 19, 2350 when ORS and EFN patrols clashed near Vesta resulting in the deaths of 2 Syndicate pilots and 8 Federate pilots. In retaliation, the Federation cruiser EFC Cretheus destroyed an ORS mining base on Ceres, killing 38 civilian miners and 9 military crewmen. Further escalation was halted by an emergency conference between High Magistrate Nehru and Federation Chancellor Archambeau where they both promised to restrain their more hawkish military commanders. 

Although the situation had officially calmed down, both the ORS and the EFN switched to waging covert actions. Across the Sol system unidentified fighters and bombers began attacking supply convoys, outposts and patrols, but both governments denied any responsibility for the attacks, instead claiming they were the work of ‘unaffiliated terrorists.' Military intelligence agencies and secret services also intensified their efforts to infiltrate the opposing side. The Federation had discovered the existence of the Syndicate's Enutriet-class factory ships and was determined to take away this strategic advantage from the ORS. EFN agents were given high priority orders to find the factory ships' staging areas and managed to find over 30 of them by the end of 2350.

In January 2351, under pressure from the pro-war faction led by Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch, Archambeau was forced to resign the EFN chancellorship and was replaced by Thomas Warfield. Walker, Rossendarch and Warfield were all determined to start a war with the ORS as soon as possible before the newly-gained intelligence on the Enutriet factory ships became outdated."

4423, "  The Martian War"

4424, "    The Martian Spark"

4425, "Instead of challenging the Syndicate directly, the new Federation government started with restoring control over the seceded provinces of Mars. A now mostly terraformed planet with a population of 11.4 billion, enveloped by a slightly thin but breathable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, and covered with several landmasses of arid and temperate climates as well as several small freshwater oceans, Mars was divided into rich pro-Earth central regions and poorer, pro-ORS outlying provinces. On January 28, 2351, the EFN issued an ultimatum to the neutral provinces of Hesperia, Nepenthe and Tyrrhena, demanding unconditional surrender to the ‘legitimate EFN government.' Nepenthe and Tyrrhena agreed to surrender and submitted to Federation control. Hesperia, however, chose to fight. 90,000 EFN marines invaded Hesperia and the 3rd Martian Fleet commenced bombardment of Hesperia City. Sixteen days and 300,000 dead or missing Hesperians later, the Federation had full control over the province. 

Frightened by EFN expansion on Mars, the provinces of Aeolis, Cimmeria and Promethea requested Syndicate aid. The Europan government publicly refused to ‘interfere in the Inner Rim's internal affairs,' but secretly began sending convoys of supplies, weapons, and ‘military advisors' to endangered provinces. On February 19, a demand to surrender was sent to Cimmeria by the EFN and was immediately rejected. 20,000 Cimmerian soldiers, reinforced by 6,000 ORS Marine advisors, defended the province against 50,000 EFN marines and the full power of the 3rd Martian Fleet for three weeks before they were eventually defeated. The Cimmerian soldiers and ORS marines who weren't killed or captured fled to several still-free provinces such as Eridania and Elysium to prepare them for the inevitable expansion of the Federate invasion.

In the meantime, the EFN military positively identified ORS soldiers among the captured Cimmerians. This violation of the ORS' publicly stated neutrality was used by the EFN as a pretext to attack the Outer Rim. On March 29, 2351, the Federation began a full-scale invasion of the Outer Rim, starting a conflict that would later be known as the Martian War."

4426, "    The Fog of War"

4427, "The initial EFN strategy of the Martian War was similar to the strategy the GTA had adopted during the Secession War. Aggressive fighter, bomber and cruiser raids took place throughout the entire Outer Rim, forcing the ORS fleet to spread themselves thin in defense of their own territory. The Federation deployed their new Praetor-class battlecarriers to serve as heavy command centers and forward bases for attacks on remote ORS outposts. This time, however, the Federation did not concentrate only on installations and moons, but struck mainly at the staging areas of the Enutriet-class mobile factories they had discovered beforehand. The Outer Rim infrastructure was heavily damaged again, although the Syndicate had several surprises for the EFN such as an experimental energy shield that protected Europan cities from orbital bombardment. 

At the same time, EFN ground forces supported by elements of the 3rd Martian Fleet conquered Elysium Island, completing the process of reuniting Mars under Federation rule. Remnants of the pro-ORS provinces' military formed a resistance movement and waged guerilla warfare on the invaders, but with no air support and limited supplies their combat capabilities were negligible. 

Perhaps the most intense battles were fought in defense of primary ORS shipyards like the ORI Valhalla where new Galahad-class heavy destroyers were being constructed. Three Galahads in various stages of construction, including the lead ship ORD Galahad herself, were destroyed during the raids. Four others, however, including High Fleetmaster Glenzmann's new flagship, the ORD Thor, survived the raids and soon joined the ORS fleet at full combat readiness after they were completed. (Since then, no Galahad-class ships have ever been destroyed by the Federation.) 

For the first weeks of the war, however, the EFN failed to realize that their focus on the Enutriet mobile factories was part of a Syndicate ruse. In fact, by this time the Syndicate had already developed a new-generation mobile infrastructure program and by focusing EFN attention on the Enutriet mobile factories, the Syndicate kept the existence of the newly-constructed ORFS Hephaestus factory ships and ORSh Qadesh mobile shipyards secret. The new mobile factories and shipyards remained hidden mostly beyond Neptune's orbit, secretly processing minerals, manufacturing weapons, and constructing ships. The EFN discovered their existence in late April 2351 when fresh Syndicate reinforcements began appearing from nowhere and heavily damaged Syndicate warships were returning to the fray after only a few days when they should have been in space dock for weeks. In total, Qadesh shipyards constructed 68 Vitalius-class frigates and 14 new Tychicus-class heavy escort frigates during the Martian War. 

Having forced the EFN to waste its time trying to negate the now-obsolete Enutriet factory ships, the Syndicate was now preparing to strike back."

4428, "    Dirty tricks"

4429, "By June 2351, the Syndicate was still on the defensive, but with continuous support from their new mobile shipyards and factories, they were mostly able to hold the line and even eventually go on the offensive to attack and heavily damage the EFCa Septimus and the EFCa Hadrianus. 

Determined to bring the fight back to the enemy by any means necessary, Fleetmaster Tessandras formed the Black Operations Department (BOD). Comprised of upgraded Tychicus-class frigates and squadrons of next-gen gunships, bombers, and fighters, the BOD was created to take the most difficult assignments, strike far beyond enemy lines, and attack enemy supply routes, infrastructure, and utility ships. With this new unit, Tessandras perfected his ability to conduct covert operations, launch hit-and-run attacks, and withdraw before the enemy could react. The BOD performed long distance raids on EFN military installations orbiting Earth and Mars, ambushed Federation forces trying to bomb targets in the Outer Rim, and hunted enemy carriers in order to take pressure off regular Syndicate forces. Aside from precision strikes, the BOD also developed a vast network of spies, assassins, infiltrators, and saboteurs covertly placed in the EFN-occupied sectors of Mars as well as on Federation installations and even front-line Federation units. 

On July 27, 2351, the Syndicate launched a massive offensive against Mars. The fleet led by the ORD Damascus destroyed the Orion-class EFD Invictus at the Battle of Deimos, a costly victory for the ORS. Simultaneously, the ORD Thor attacked Augustus Station, the primary EFN shipyard in Mars orbit, destroying the still-under-construction Praetor-class EFCa Churchill and the entire 3rd Martian Fleet. Both victories were only made possible by the ORS' new Galahad-class destroyers, which outmatched the Orion-class destroyers as well as the Praetor-class battlecarriers. "

4430, "    The Iron Rain"

4431, "While the ORS fleet was still battling the EFN 3rd Martian Fleet, preparations were made for a ground assault on Mars. BOD operatives had spent several weeks infiltrating occupied provinces, seeking remnants of the resistance, and organizing volunteers to take up the fight for the liberation of Mars. It wasn't long before open rebellion broke out in the major cities of Cimmeria, Cydonia and other provinces. Several important Federate governors were assassinated in the confusion. Simultaneously, ORS forces led by Fleetmaster Caliphtys of the Ironclad began bombarding planetary defenses and military garrisons located in pro-EFN provinces on Mars. 

At 17:00 hours on August 1, the Syndicate commenced Operation Iron Rain. 2,800,000 ORS soldiers began the liberation of Mars, making it the largest planetary invasion since the Unification Wars. ORS forces landed mostly in the EFN-occupied provinces of Cimmeria, Aeolis, Eridania and Elysium Island where they joined forces with the resistance. On the opposing side, the EFN ground forces on Mars comprised of more than 2,200,000 regular soldiers, 900,000 militiamen and mercenaries and 9,000,000 conscripts. However, they were spread thinly across the surface and morale among the irregulars was very low. Using their temporary orbital superiority to their advantage, the Syndicate made a special effort to bombard only those areas where the regular EFN ground forces were concentrated and leave the irregular forces alone in an effort to sway the native Martians to their side. 

After initial victories at Elysium and Cimmeria, the ORS offensive headed west to the heavily fortified regions of Eridania, Tyrrhena and Hesperia. There, however, they encountered heavy resistance. Until mid-September both sides struggled to advance, but despite several hundred thousand casualties on both sides, a stalemate ensued on Tyrrhena Plateau and Hesperia's eastern border. As all attempted offensives were held off by the opposing side, both armies used their numerous construction drones to build huge fortifications hundreds of kilometers in length and garrisons placed mostly under the planet's surface. The stalemate wasn't broken even by intensive orbital bombardments commenced by both sides nor by biological and chemical weapons reintroduced by the Federate military. "

4432, "    Lion of the Federation"

4433, "While the bulk of the ORS ground forces was occupied on Mars and the majority of the ORS warships struggled to support the invasion, the EFN fleet under Admiral Walker regrouped after several setbacks and started a counteroffensive from Earth codenamed “Heaven's Fury.” Walker's flagship, the EFCa Tiberius, as well as the EFCa Executor and the EFCa Praetorian, launched a combined strike against the Galilean moons. After having stormed the defenses of Io and Ganymede, destroying two Orion-class destroyers, the ORD Cataphract and the ORD Vesuvius, the Tiberius and its fleet commenced orbital bombardment of both moons. Simultaneously, Walker dispatched small hunter-killer teams comprised of 3 Solomon-class frigates each equipped with advanced jump drives to harass ORS second-line units with devastating shock-jump attacks. 

Forced to choose between continuing the offensive on Mars, making a surprise strike at a now vulnerable Earth, or withdrawing to defend the Outer Rim, High Fleetmaster Glenzmann chose the last option, leaving the ground troops still fighting on Mars with the support of only the Ironclad's war-torn flotilla. The Thor then headed for Io to confront the Tiberius. Familiar with a Galahad-class' close combat capabilities and having learned a hard lesson from Operation Punisher, Walker gave Glenzmann's flagship a wide berth and sent bombers to destroy the Thor's primary railguns. The strategy worked and the partially disarmed Thor became an easy target for the Tiberius' fleet. Luckily for Glenzmann and the Thor, BOD frigates arrived and inflicted enough damage to the Tiberius' escort to allow the Thor to escape. The Tiberius continued to bombard Io and damage the moon's orbital infrastructure for eight hours before the Thor and the BOD frigates could regroup and chase the Federate battle group away from Io. 

For the next few weeks, the ORS was on the defensive again. Walker kept striking at Syndicate targets across the Outer Rim, earning himself the title 'The Lion of the Federation'. His hunter-killer teams and Tessandras' BOD taskforces continued to stalk each other while the bulk of the Syndicate fleet was forced to defend the moons of Jupiter and Saturn."

4434, "    Tools of destruction"

4435, "In the meantime, Admiral Rossendarch, now commanding the EFCa Sovereign, returned to Mars orbit and confronted Fleetmaster Caliphtys' battle group. As both commanders were too cautious to risk a frontal assault, they sent skirmishers on flanking attacks, made precision orbital bombardments and launched bomber raids against their opponent's ground forces still stalemated on the planet's surface. In the following months, Martian cities were pounded into rubble and –- according to post-war estimates -- more than 30,000,000 civilians were declared dead or missing. 

Hoping to break the deadlock, the Federation began preparations to use Xanthean Gas, an experimental chemical weapon of mass destruction named after Xanthea, the Martian province where the secret facility that had created the weapon was located. Although after the war the EFN banned the weapon and classified all data pertaining to Xanthean Gas to prevent it from ever being used again, it was revealed that the gas was in fact a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that could direct its poisonous cloud in any desired direction. Each nanobot performed a micro-scale chemical reaction that transformed components of the terraformed Martian air into a deadly poison gas. 

The EFN first used small samples of Xanthean Gas on several remote sectors of the front lines. The poisonous cloud directed by the nanobots was capable of penetrating or damaging air filters and gas masks, entering deep into ORS fortifications, and even choking entire battalions in their own barracks. Syndicate marines were forced to leave their prepared positions and defend in the open field, making them vulnerable targets for EFN bombers and artillery. More and more garrisons were being decimated and the ORS saw no way to counter Xanthean Gas other than to destroy entire infected facilities. Hoping to prevent the total defeat of their forces, the ORS prioritized finding the source of the deadly weapon. 

BOD operatives managed to locate the Xanthea facility where the nanobots were being produced and stored. On October 6, 2351, the ORD Ironclad entered Mars' low orbit and, while under the heavy fire of EFN planetary defenses, destroyed the facility with its cannons. This action, however, instead of removing the threat, merely opened the floodgates. The data that ORS Intelligence agents had gathered on Xanthean Gas nanobots indicated they could not survive a planetary bombardment of that scale. However, unbeknownst to the ORSI agents, the facility also contained the next generation of nanobots that were more resistant to physical damage and high temperature. After the bombardment, these nanobots were damaged and became nonresponsive to remote shutdown attempts, but were still operational. As a result of the bombardment, they went haywire and began poisoning the atmosphere. Larger and larger areas of Mars became contaminated, previously breathable air became poisonous, and toxic rains began destroying the terraformed vegetation so difficult to grow and adapt to Martian conditions."

4436, "    Hesperian Armistice"

4437, "While the battle for Mars remained inconclusive, both sides were now under the threat of a planetary-scale cataclysm which would render the planet uninhabitable. Terrified by this prospect, more and more soldiers of both decimated armies, many of whom were native Martians, refused to fight. The ORS and the EFN held an emergency summit on October 9 and agreed to a ceasefire, despite internal opposition on both sides. Soldiers of both armies who were still able to act were sent to provide humanitarian aid to Mars' civilian population and deal with the damage dealt by Xanthean Gas. 

EFN and ORS fleet commanders, who could not bring themselves to believe the scale of the cataclysm on Mars, were initially reluctant to cease hostilities. Admiral Walker's hunter-killer teams and BOD operatives continued to fight minor skirmishes in the Outer Rim for a few more days before both the EFN and ORS governments convinced their military commanders to abide by the ceasefire. 

On October 29, a second Martian summit was held, this time in Hesperia City, where both sides agreed to an armistice that would divide Mars into EFN and ORS zones. The rest of the Sol system mostly returned to pre-Martian War boundaries. 

Xanthean Gas contaminated vast areas of Mars' surface and caused several million casualties. It took several years to eradicate all the nanobots and stop the contamination from spreading further, and decades more would be needed before the damaged environment could fully recover."

4438, "  The Second Interbellum"

4439, "  The Decline of the Federation"

4440, "The Martian War ended in a draw, but its aftermath was far more consequential to the Federation than one would have expected. A peace initiative undertaken by Martian leaders was taken as an insult by the Earth regime as well as by the military units under Admirals Walker and Rossendarch, both of whom insisted on continuing the war. Open and successful opposition to the EFN agenda by Mars encouraged Earth's less radical parties to demand political reforms such as restoring GTA-era individual liberties and restraining internal security services from persecuting their own citizens. Mass protests broke out in New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other major cities on Earth, but they were brutally pacified by police and military alike. The government responded with more radical propaganda, greater restrictions on freedom of speech and even more government surveillance of the civilian population. In October 2352, a year after the Hesperian Armistice, the EFN had become a fully totalitarian regime where every aspect of life and the economy was controlled by a paranoid, fascist government. 

The direction of EFN policy was another reason for further tensions between Earth and Mars. The assorted provincial governments of Mars concentrated their efforts on fighting the Xanthean cataclysm, clearing the atmosphere of the nanobots, decontaminating the Martian environment, and providing humanitarian aid to the residents of the most vulnerable areas. EFN-aligned Martians had no problem working with the governments of pro-Syndicate provinces or even accepting aid from the ORS itself to clean up the Xanthean disaster. 

No dictatorship could remain in power without directing social anger against an enemy -- real or imagined. In August 2354, the government in Shanghai nationalized Triton Dynamics and arrested their board members officially for fraud and tax evasion, but the real reason was because the corporation supported the Hesperian Armistice and cooperated with ORS rescue and decontamination teams. 

This policy of full centralization and terror adversely affected Earth's economy. In December 2354, following the nationalization of Mesa Corporation, the stock markets collapsed and resulted in Earth's greatest recession in 120 years. The political officers and statesmen that replaced corporate management made a series of tragic mistakes and military production began to drop. 

In order to save the EFN from total economic collapse, Admiral Walker announced martial law throughout EFN territory and gave power to a new government comprised entirely of military officers and technocrats loyal only to him. They began a purge in the EFN administration, arrested politicians and statesmen responsible for previous disastrous policy and sentenced them to death or imprisonment in show trials. They restored some of the previous more liberal corporate laws, but they didn't end the persecution and government surveillance of civilians. The economic crisis in the EFN ended in 2358, but even then, the Federation hadn't regained its former vitality. Admiral Walker continued to be the strongest force in EFN politics while Admiral Rossendarch focused on reorganizing the 3rd Martian Fleet and his own secret military projects. 

Throughout the 2360s, the ORS was the dominant faction in Sol and the EFN's influence was restricted to Earth, Luna, the central provinces of Mars and several outposts on Mercury and Venus. However, as the economic situation on Earth began to slowly improve, Admiral Walker's agents in the EFN government began a new fleet construction program, introducing new ship classes like the EFC Viscount, the EFFg Vidar and the EFD Talos, the latter of which was specifically designed to confront the Syndicate's Galahad-class heavy destroyers in close combat. 

Meanwhile, in the Outer Rim, seeing the EFN's weak but improving economy as an opportunity that could soon slip away, the Syndicate began preparations in early 2367 for a preemptive strike to bring the Federation to its knees once and for all. "

4441, "  Operation Mjornir"

4442, "    Battle of Ceres"

4443, "In late 2367, after the Syndicate had made numerous secret preparations for war throughout the year, High Fleetmaster Glenzmann mobilized the entire Syndicate military for a new, third war with the Federation. This time, however, the Syndicate would be the one to strike the first blow. For several years the Federation had been struck by economic crisis and political turmoil, but it had begun to recover. The choice for the ORS was simple: either the ORS could make a preemptive strike from a position of strength now, or the Federation would rebuild its military power and start yet another war with the Syndicate in a few years anyway. Seeing no viable alternative, the Syndicate Magistratorium approved Operation Mjolnir, Glenzmann's plan to preemptively strike the EFN. 

Fleetmaster Tessandras and his BOD operatives had spent several years reconnoitering the defenses around Earth. After the Martian War, the Federation's strategy had been focused on defense rather than launching large offensives. Earth itself was protected by a barricade of warships, heavily armed installations and sentry guns. Meanwhile, several Praetor-class carriers were randomly patrolling near the EFN-ORS border ready to provide fighter and bomber support. If a Syndicate offensive on Earth was to have any chance of succeeding, those Federate carriers had to be tracked down and destroyed. 

After years of effort, a BOD sleeper agent successfully advanced though the ranks in the EFN military hierarchy to become chief engineer on the EFCa Praetorian. While undercover, he created an undetectable quantum network connected with other deep cover BOD agents operating on the EFCa Hadrianus and the EFCa Septimus. Through these agents' efforts, the ORS was able to discover that all three battlecarriers were stationed at several rally points near Ceres. 

On October 3, 2367, the agents sent their locations to the ORS via subspace micro-tunnels. The ORD Thor, the ORD Sultan, and their battle groups jumped to the rally points and attacked the three EFN battlecarriers. During the battle, the quantum network was activated and a techno-virus sabotaged the jump drives and primary weaponry on all three battlecarriers. The ORS destroyed the battlecarriers and their escort ships, opening a path for a Syndicate offensive on the Inner Rim. 

Operation Mjolnir was now in motion. "

4444, "    The Liberation of Mars"

4445, "By 2367 many of the pro-EFN leaders of Mars were very concerned about the situation on Earth. Another wave of political purges by the EFN government left the Federation unstable, divided and vulnerable to external threats. Although Martian participation in this political turmoil was rather half-hearted, fear had begun to grow for the planet's future within the Federation. Even in central, traditionally pro-Earth provinces like Xanthea and Acidalia, a pro-ORS political party began to rise in popularity and influence. 

Two hours after the launch of Operation Mjolnir, when the first ORS raids hit several Martian orbital facilities, a secret offer was made by Fleetmaster Caliphtys to the leaders of several hesitant Martian provinces. In exchange for formally joining the Syndicate, or at least disarming Federate military and planetary defenses, the Syndicate promised not to bomb any targets in these provinces and guaranteed them full autonomy within the Syndicate after the war. While the previously independent provinces of Hesperia and Cydonia were more than eager to get rid of Federate rule once and for all, Xanthea, Meridia and most central provinces remained loyal to the Earth government. 

The Syndicate offensive on Mars was led by Fleetmaster Caliphtys, now commanding the Galahad-class ORD Demetrius. His old ship, the ORD Ironclad, was also present under the command of a young and promising fleetmaster named Horatio Tyrone. Admiral Rossendarch defended Mars for four days, but eventually withdrew his flagship to Earth and undertook no further actions apart from launching fighter and bomber raids. 

With almost full domination in both space and air support, the ORS ground forces advanced rapidly on the planet's surface. Hesperia, Cydonia and several other provinces were captured after only a few weeks of fighting. Entire EFN battalions from these provinces defected to the ORS with the blessings of their local governments. The ORS planned to take the fight to the central provinces where the pro-EFN loyalists were too strong for those provinces to switch sides. Unfortunately, the EFN had turned their major cities into mighty fortresses surrounded with thick walls and packed with artillery batteries and aircraft bases. To soften these defenses, Fleetmaster Caliphtys began massive bombardments of the central provinces. This stage of the war came to be known in history as the ‘Eighteen Days Bombardment of Mars.' During that period, the EFN military infrastructure was shattered, including the famous Acidalian Military Academy, numerous garrisons and several starports. 

On November 14, the ORS flag was waving over the capital of Xanthea while several other EFN provinces were almost overrun. Soon after, the Syndicate accepted the unconditional surrender of Meridia. The total liberation of Mars was at hand."

4446, "    Wounded beast's last breath"

4447, "With the ORS' chain of victories on Mars, the EFN had written off the planet. Admiral Walker focused on fortifying Earth's defenses while Admiral Rossendarch launched a series of aggressive counterstrikes on the Outer Rim. ORS High Command [“Valhalla Command”?] was surprised at how easily Rossendarch put the dwindling Federate fleet at risk knowing he could not truly harm the Syndicate's production capabilities. The EFN warships fought valiantly at Ganymede, Titan, and in Mars orbit, but the ORS won all those engagements. Rossendarch's taskforces attacked in many places simultaneously, but they immediately withdrew soon after the arrival of Syndicate reinforcements. Rossendarch's flagship, the EFCa Sovereign, was ambushed by the ORD Thor in Europa's orbit and crash-jumped after taking moderate damage. Several Federate sources indicated that the Sovereign's jump drive exploded while in subspace, resulting in the destruction of the battlecarrier with all hands lost, including Admiral Rossendarch. Many other EFN ships participating in the counter-offensive met a similar fate. 

It remains unknown to this day what Rossendarch's intentions truly were. The most probable theory is that he tried to buy time for Admiral Walker and the 1st Gaian Fleet to finish fortifying Earth's defenses. It is possible the jump drives of Rossendarch's ships were hacked or sabotaged, but the ORS never confirmed such operations took place. Eventually, the EFN counter-strike inflicted only minor damage to ORS infrastructure, though it did force the Thor and several flotillas to temporarily withdraw to the Outer Rim and thus delayed the Syndicate offensive on Earth by two or three days. 

By November 15, 2367, the only EFN force that posed a threat to the ORS was the fleet gathered around Earth commanded by Admiral Walker, the Lion of the Federation himself. Walker was clearly ready to fight until the bitter end. The siege of Earth began on November 15 with aggressive ORS raids on the Blue Planet's orbital installations. On November 16, the ORD Sultan destroyed the massive Teheran Shipyard in lunar orbit and the next day the ORD Thor and the ORD Damascus destroyed the EFCa Executor and the gargantuan G1 command facility orbiting above North America.

Despite these victories, the ORS never got a chance to hunt down Admiral Walker and destroy the Federation for good. "

4448, "  The Shivan Invasion of Sol"

4449, "  The Beta Volantis node opens"

4450, "On November 17, 2367, ORS science vessels reported a strange subspace anomaly beyond the Kuiper's Belt. Syndicate authorities dismissed the phenomenon at first as regular subspace fluctuations. Two days later, the ORSC Sentinel was deployed to take a closer look at the anomaly. Shortly upon arrival, it came under attack by Shivan fighters. Just before the Sentinel was destroyed, its crew managed to scan the anomaly and transmitted the data to the ORI Lagertha. The scan data clearly showed that the anomaly was a stable subspace jump node.

The Syndicate fleet was put on high alert and Operation Mjolnir was aborted. During an emergency conference on November 18, ORS and EFN leaders agreed to a ceasefire and immediately repositioned their fleets against the new threat. The Sixth Plutonian Fleet's taskforce, led by the ORD Agnostica, was deployed to blockade the jump node. By the time it arrived, the Shivans had already begun moving their fleet into Sol. The Sixth Fleet managed to successfully blockade the jump node but continued to suffer minor casualties over the next few days as the Shivans made several failed attempts to run the blockade. "

4451, "POLITICS"

4452, "  Outer Rim Syndicate (1)"

4453, "The Outer Rim Syndicate (ORS) is a pact of Outer Rim worlds, colonies, and corporations formed on June 3, 2339 in opposition to the tyranny and exploitation of the GTA and Inner Rim corporations. The most powerful politicians of the ORS were members of ruling parties or governors of the gas giants' moons like Europa, Io, Ganymede, Calypso, Titan, Iapetus, Rhea, Ariel, Triton, and Nereid. Multiple corporate consortiums like the Jovian Collective, the Saturn Financial Combine and the Miners League also wield the status of ORS members, as well as outlying colony associations like the Free People of the Oort Cloud. 

At its peak in November 2367, the Outer Rim Syndicate was made up of the following territories: 
- Jupiter and all its moons with the capital in Siraxta City on Europa.
- Saturn and all its moons with the capital in Veridian on Enceladus.
- Uranus and all its moons with the capital in Cefaliassna[What kind of name is this? Read Alexandr Pope's “The Rape of the Lock” to find a better name.] on Umbriel
- Neptune and all its moons with the capital on Aphaea Station orbiting Triton.
- Pluto with its capital on Agartha.
- Oort District 01 with its capital on Polyphemus Station
- Oort District 02 with its capital on Lagertha Station
- Oort District 03 with the capital on Gray Abyss on Aslaug
- Oort District 04 with the capital on Telsyma Station
- Oort District 05 with the capital on Teheran Station
- Oort District 06 with the capital on Nestor Station
- The liberated or conquered provinces of Mars including Noachia, Nirgal Valley, Arabia Tyrrhena Plateau, Da Valley, Harmakis Valley, Hellespont Mountains, Malea Plain, Promethea, Cimmerian Desert, Hesperia Region, Nepenthe Valley, Aeolian Coast, Lake Guse, Elysium Island, Syrtis, Cydonia, Meridian Steppe and Xanthea District on Mars with the capital in Kepler on Tyrrhena Plateau. 

At this time the Outer Rim was protected by 9 Galahad-class destroyers, 3 Orion-class destroyers, more than 600 [What the actual fuck. There can't be six hundred frigates in the fleet.] frigate- and cruiser-grade warships and 900 [What the actual fuck. There can't be nine hundred fighter squadrons in the fleet.] fighter and bomber squadrons. The Syndicate Marine Corps included 11,400,000 ground soldiers and marines, 1,250,000 tanks and other ground vehicles and 914,000 hovercraft and aircraft. "

4454, "  Outer Rim Syndicate (2)"

4455, "As per the Europan Convention the Syndicate guarantees its citizens economic liberties as well as freedom of speech, religion and association. Both small and medium sized businesses and big corporations benefit from free market policy, including far-reaching deregulation and radical tax cuts. The Syndicate also provides duty-free zones within the Outer Rim, although maintains strict control over trade with the Inner Rim to prevent pro-EFN corporations from gaining influence. 

The ORS' executives powers belong to the Syndicate Magistratorium with its seat on Valhalla Station in high orbit of Europa. The Magistratorium consists of 27 Magistrates, each responsible for a different area of responsibility. Its members are elected on 6-year-long terms of office by the Syndicate Parliament. The current head of the Magistratorium is High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari, who began his second term in August 2367. 

The Syndicate Parliament, the primary ORS legislative body, is made up of 1,265 representatives of Outer Rim colonies and associations. Each member world elects a given number of members of Parliament depending on their population, wealth and contribution to the ORS central budget. 

The Syndicate's central administration is responsible for defense, external affairs and key branches of the economy. Other areas, including economic, social and cultural policy, are mostly decentralized and left to local governments as long as they do not violate Syndicate articles as stated in the Europan Convention."

4456, "  Earth Federated Nations (1)"

4457, "Earth Federated Nations (EFN) is a totalitarian (formerly authoritarian) regime that has ruled Earth and parts of Mars since January 20, 2341. It was formed following a summit in Shanghai by 29 Earth pan-national factions after the collapse of the Galactic Terran Alliance more than a year earlier, including: 
- the American Conglomerate
- the European Union
- the Indo-Asian Confederation
- the Republic of China
On March 7, 2341, the EFN was joined by a pact of 9 Martian provinces led by Xanthea and Meridia. Other territories controlled by the EFN include: 
- Luna 
- the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos
- Outposts and science facilities on Mercury and Venus
- Multiple installations and mining colonies in the Asteroid Belt, including Ceres

At the beginning of November 2367, the EFN fleet consisted of 12 Praetor-class battlecarriers, 6 Talos-class destroyers and 350 smaller warships. Their ground forces, including garrisons on Earth and Mars included 16,230,000 soldiers, 1,750,000 ground vehicles and 1,200,000 hovercraft and aircraft."

4458, "  Earth Federated Nations (2)"

4459, "The EFN is ruled by the High Council of Terra with its seat in Shanghai. It is a centralized, almost omnipotent body of technocrats that systematically acquired control over more and more aspects of life and the economy. The members of the High Council are selected by the local parliaments of EFN member states, but their election is usually under the strong influence of military parties. Elections are still held in most regions of Earth, but they remain a facade because of the drastically limited freedom of association and the lack of the right to form political parties critical of the EFN agenda. 

The EFN's economy became systematically centralized and regulated, combining policies of several pre-Unification War Earth regimes and fascist ideologies dating back to the 20th century. The largest corporations remain under the strong influence of the High Council and focus their interest on military production. EFN society is under the intense surveillance of EFN's internal security services, of which the most fearsome and potent is the infamous Terra Security Office. 

The advanced and ubiquitous tools of control came together with the extended brainwashing of Earth citizens by government propaganda. Federation officials, government-controlled corporations, and the media flood EFN society with the doctrine of new Earth nationalism: the need for unconditional loyalty to Grand Terra combined with hatred towards the Outer Rim."

4460, "  Syndicate Exodus Fleet"

4461, "Formed shortly after the execution of Operation Moyses, the Syndicate Exodus Fleet is a planetless state that is made up of more than 1,500 ships which escaped the Sol system after the Shivan invasion of Sol in November 2367. When the Fleet arrived in Cor Caroli, it was home to about 1.19 million people, originating both from evacuated Syndicate moons and Outer Rim space stations. Almost half of the Fleet's population remains in cryo-sleep on three Abraham-class colony ships -- the Spirit of Hope, the Abraham, and the Adrastus.

All non-military ships of the Fleet are grouped into the Colony Fleet while the remaining ships of the ORS and EFN military formed the Syndicate Exodus Navy which in turn was further subdivided into the Escort Fleet, the Heavy Fleet, the Roaming Fleet and the Federate Taskforce."

4462, "    Syndicate Magistratorium"

4463, "The Fleet is governed by the Syndicate Magistratorium reestablished by High Magistrate Al-Zardari onboard the ORCo Spirit of Hope. The Magistratorium is currently made up of 14 members of the pre-Exodus ORS government that survived the invasion, but there are plans to fill in the vacancies with surviving members of the Syndicate Parliament or even representatives of the biggest ships in the Colony Fleet. 

The Magistratorium upholds many laws and liberties from the old Syndicate, although the impromptu nature of the Exodus Fleet required many responsibilities to be ceded to military commanders. 

The High Magistrate is also the head of numerous scientific projects vital for the Fleet's maintenance and survival. Above all, he maintains a team of skilled specialists called the Navigators, who are responsible for analyzing scans and recon data as well as charting the course of the Exodus Fleet."

4464, "    Equilibrists (1)"

4465, "Founded in 2339 and formally known as the 'Church of Equilibrium,' the ultimate goal of the Equilibrists was to establish a single unified spiritual system of philosophy or quasi-religion. The purpose of this philosophy was the eradication of dogma-based beliefs, demagogy and superstitions among citizens of the Outer Rim. Also informally known as the 'Philosophers Guild,' Equilibrists were spiritual leaders of the population of planets lying beyond Mars and the Asteroid Belt. The initial concept of universal religion has been present since ancient times, but the actual organization founded by then-Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari was the first, widely distributed effort to establish a religious organization based on a concept of one universal and dogma-free philosophy. One of the major tenets of Equalibrianism was accuracy with modern science and Quantum M-Theory considered as currently valid.

Equalibrianism represents an agnostic view on the old question about God's existence. It rejects the traditional concept of God as a target of rituals, ceremonies and prayers represented by religions of old Earth and instead emphasizes natural balance and harmony of the Universe. There is a popular, although non-compulsory, Equilibristic concept of a meta-creative, omnipotent being capable of influencing the physical world by interfering with zero-state quantum fields of information, shaping events around all living, sentient, conscious beings and creating unique purposes for each of them. The direct reason for creating this concept was derived from official Syndicate propaganda. It was still centered around personal development and the concept of individual purpose, aligned with serving ORS interests and goals. Although initially criticized by early intellectual and scientific elites, it began to rise in popularity when the Secession War and the Martian War raged across the Outer Rim, strengthening the need for belief among both soldiers and civilians. This aspect of Equalibrianism became dominant after the Exodus and is represented by several influential figures within the Fleet and the Magistratorium like Fleetmaster Aasira Raji and High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari. 

An initial basis for Equalibrianism was Zen Tibetan Buddhism. Official propaganda of the ORS supported all kinds of spiritual practices with scientifically proven mental effects like reducing stress or increasing overall brain capacity. Meditation with the focus on internal calm, emotion tuning, and eradicating negative behavior was widely taught in all Equilibrist cathedrals among the Outer Rim. Although the majority of early ORS citizens were Christian, Hindu or Muslim, Equilibrist efforts successfully managed to convert the majority of ORS citizens to the Church of Equilibrium or persuaded them to adapt elements of Equilibristic philosophy into their old beliefs. The term Equilibrist describes both followers of the philosophy and activists of the Church of Equilibrium. Scientifically correct spiritual philosophy has proven itself extremely successful in maintaining social harmony mostly because it was compatible with many assumptions of already existing major belief systems. 'Leave all the dogma. Leave all the old books and people claiming themselves as saviors and prophets. The Universe is not judging, not forbidding, not siding with heaven nor hell. The Universe is shaping your path in this life, listening to everyone, and shaping your purpose individually. You just need to look inside yourself, and help the Universe help you find your place in this world.' Those and other simple tenets were very successful and popular among citizens of the ORS. Unlike many other religions, there was no concept of a creator of the universe in Equilibrist thought. The Universe was actually supposed to be its own creation, constantly maintaining itself."

4466, "    Equilibrists (2)"

4467, "Although the Church of Equilibrium was established as a massive propaganda tool for the Syndicate Magistratorium, it wasn't only a tool in the hands of politicians. Equalibrianism was initially designed to be a supplement to the ORS' free-market economy and individual liberties to boost already excellent economic growth and uphold political stability. Equalibrianism was based on several hundreds of years' worth of psychological studies, and even more ancient teachings. In addition to eradicating all extremist and dogmatic beliefs from ORS society, Equalibrianism was created was to provide social stability, ensure economic growth, and support ORS military doctrine. The Church of Equilibrium is an extremely influential political tool, but its priests were also responsible for observing the state of social mentality. Ensuring the happiness of ORS citizens was a real long-term goal. A happy and wealthy society was an important factor in the economic supremacy of the ORS, and was also key to its eventual victory of the Rim Conflict.

A handful of individuals actually discovered their psionic potential thanks to meditation practices taught by Equilibrists. There were also reported cases of establishing temporary mental contact with beings of unknown nature and origin. All alleged mystic experiences were examined as part of the Blue Omega project, but its results remain highly classified. 

The dark, infamous part of the Church of Equilibrium were the Zealots – a group of BOD-trained agents that specialized in hunting down cultists, fanatics, terrorists, extremists, and EFN agents alike. These BOD-associated individuals were sometimes considered as a 'spiritual militia'. Although most ORS citizens were liberal in their beliefs and outlook, Zealots were active hunters responsible for erasing epicenters of so called 'dangerous thinking.' Although their covert operations were only meant to uphold ORS safety and were supported by the Magistratorium, the ORS military, and even the Black Operations Department, the Zealots became grim urban legends among some social circles.

Many Equilibrists survived the Exodus and reestablished the Church of Equilibrium onboard the colony ship ORCo Spirit of Hope. They now continue to provide spiritual support and guidance for fellow survivors in the Exodus Fleet. They are answerable directly to the renominated High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari."

4470, "The Escort Fleet is the largest unit of the Syndicate Exodus Navy. Comprised of more than 60% of all the warships that survived the Shivan invasion of Sol, the Escort Fleet operates closely with the Colony Fleet and provides full-time protection to all non-combat vessels. When the Colony Fleet is stationary for whatever reason, the standard procedure is to have the Escort Fleet form and hold a cordon around the Colony Fleet's main staging areas and only launch short-range patrols and scouting parties. Once the Colony Fleet is on the move, it is grouped into large convoys and the Escort Fleet constantly accompanies them to the next system. The convoys do not participate in any offensive action unless there is absolutely no other option. Most Escort Fleet commanding officers were part of the 2nd Jovian Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Hector Caliphtys, the commanding officer of Operation Moyses. Caliphtys, a well-known and respected fleetmaster of the Outer Rim Syndicate, now leads the Escort Fleet.

Led by the charismatic Fleetmaster Horatio Tyrone, the Roaming Fleet was established during the Exodus Navy's reorganization in Cor Caroli. It is an autonomous force capable of taking the offensive on its own, clearing the path for the Exodus Fleet and securing its rear guard from any incoming Shivan pursuit. It also performs long-range recon missions, finds mineral resources in any star system through which the Exodus Fleet transits, protects mining operations in nebulas and asteroid fields, and deals with any Shivan pursuers that show up after the bulk of the Exodus Fleet has cleared the system.

This elite escort formation was established mostly from the remaining ships of the 3rd Saturnian Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Aasira Raji. Raji's forces played a crucial part holding off the Shivan armada in the final stage of Operation Moyses, but at the cost of the destruction of half of the 3rd Fleet with the rest critically damaged. Brought back into action during the Exodus Fleet's stopover in Cor Caroli, the Heavy Fleet now cooperates closely with the Escort Fleet, providing protection to the three colony ships and other strategic units of the Colony Fleet.

4476, "The Federate Taskforce is the remnant of the Earth Federated Nations fleet that joined Syndicate forces in executing Operation Moyses. At first, the Federate Taskforce was an autonomous unit under the command of Rear Admiral Victor Leibniz of the EFD Redemption, but several EFN warships were later transferred to the Roaming and Escort fleets. This reallocation was caused by the Midwinter Incident. The Federate Taskforce is comprised mostly of warships from the former 1st Gaian Fleet commanded by Admiral Donathan Walker that were supposed to be deployed to Earth orbit to delay the orbital bombardment commenced by the Sathanas juggernauts. Thanks to diplomatic overtures by Fleetmaster Caliphtys, Admiral Leibniz and several other EFN commanders of the 1st Fleet refused Federate Command's orders to defend Earth to the last man and joined the Syndicate Exodus Fleet. 

The Solomon-class frigates and the Evangelist-class and Viscount-class cruisers in the Federate Taskforce are deployed on similar assignments as their ORS counterparts. The Vidar-class warships of the Federate Taskforce, however, are the heaviest frigate-grade warships in the entire Exodus Fleet, so they are held in reserve for the most dangerous assignments.

An impressive armada of over 1,500 civilian and supply ships, it is the beating heart of the whole Syndicate Exodus Fleet. The Colony Fleet is responsible for political, economic, agricultural, industrial, and medical tasks, supplying both itself and all three military fleets. Although numerous smaller civilian craft were modified for various purposes, the Colony Fleet is still centered around the three Abraham-class colony ships –- the Spirit of Hope, the Abraham and the Adrastus. All three house the majority of Sol's survivors. Five factory ships -- the Ida Lewis, the Qatna, the Vanadium, the Ikenga and the Hadur -- are responsible for the production of ammunition, spare parts, and reactive hull plates, but also for constructing fighters and bombers and refining raw materials. The sole remaining Qadesh-class mobile shipyard, the Big Buddha, is probably the busiest ship in the whole Exodus Fleet, constantly repairing and modifying both military and civilian starships. The majority of supplies are stored in Nautilus-class mass cargo haulers, while Pluto-class gas miners like the Raspadskaja or the Luchtaine are responsible for refining raw gas from nebulae into deuterium to power the reactors of the Exodus Fleet.

4479, "LOCATIONS"

4480, "  Earth"

4481, "For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society. 

Since the 21st century, Earth was divided into several nation states competing with one another in space colonization efforts. Of these, the most important ones were the American Conglomerate, created after the bankruptcy of the United States of America; the federalized block of the Old World nations known as the European Union; and the Republic of China. Despite local conflicts, arms races, and constant rivalry, none of them were able to dominate the others and the network of economic connections was too valuable for anyone to benefit from a total war. In the beginning of the space colonization era, they had sent mostly separate expeditions and the newly created colonies belonged to their respective nations just like territories colonized by the European kingdoms in the Age of Exploration during the 15th through 17th centuries. However, the further the colonization process progressed, the less significant national boundaries between the colonies became, mainly because of the close integration of the Earth's nation states and the increasing role of the corporate sector in funding new expeditions. The process was even accelerated after the discovery of subspace in the mid-23rd century. 

However, old hostilities resumed at the beginning of the 24th century when Earth was hit by an economic crisis leading to a conflict known the Unification War. The devastating system-scale conflict lasted three years, but resulted in the ultimate dissolution of these national states and the creation of a planetary government known as the Galactic Terran Alliance. 

Earth remained the GTA capital world while the now-united Terrans continued space colonization efforts until the start of the Great War. After the destruction of the SD Lucifer and the isolation of the Sol system from the rest of Terran space, what remained of the GTA seat of government on Earth effectively became a government without a nation.

In 2339, the GTA collapsed as a result of the destruction of Zion Installation at the end of the Secession War. A few months of chaos followed before the factions of Earth reunited into the Earth Federated Nations. Earth remained the EFN capital until its destruction during the Shivan invasion in December 2367."

4482, "  Europa"

4483, "Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons. The terraforming of Europa was begun by the American Conglomerate and European Union in 2134, as Europa was intended to be the headquarters for exploring Jupiter's deuterium-rich gas fields and other moons. Although less costly and less monumental than the terraforming of Mars, the conversion of Europa was more difficult due to close proximity of Jupiter and the radiation generated by the enormous gas planet. Ganymede, whose dipolar magnetic field protected it from the radiation of its mother planet, was the first alternate candidate base of operations while Callisto was the second. Enormous volcanic formations found beneath the frozen surface of Europa and oceans of liquid water finally contributed to its eventual selection. A planetary-scale greenhouse effect was induced on Europa to melt the icy surface and generate a denser atmosphere to protect the new global oceans from Jupiter's radiation. Enormous floating cities were constructed on top of gigantic volcanic formations that had been discovered in 2029 under the ice. Although the global ocean of Europa reached down to 120 km beneath the surface, many large volcanic formations had been growing for millions of years and their pinnacles reached towards the ocean's surface, some of them only 3-7 km below the surface of the Europan Ocean. Those supervolcanoes became the foundations for the new floating cities. The largest one -- supervolcano Siraxta -- was even bigger than the Yellowstone Caldera located on Earth and became the foundation for the moon's capital city. All of the largest floating cities have been constructed on top of underwater volcanos, harvesting their natural thermal energy. The tallest of Europa's volcanoes -- the Sizifus -- is located on the southern hemisphere and is 73km high. It is also the highest known mountain in the Sol system.

The floating cities of Europa were well known symbols of prosperity among the citizens of the ORS, and proof of the technological advancement of the Outer Rim. Before the Shivan invasion, Europa was home to 430 million people living in the floating cities and on numerous orbital installations. Also, Europa was the largest source of water for the Outer Rim. Ganymede, Enceladus, Umbriel and some other icy moons went through a similar terraforming process but none became as prosperous as Europa. For many years, Europa was a shining beacon of Outer Rim independence, economic and scientific progress, and individual freedom."

4484, "SPECIES"

4485, "The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. 

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device appeared on most Great War-era GTA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other when cooperating in their stand against the Lucifer armada. 

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War."

4486, "Over thirty years after the Great War, we still know almost nothing about the Shivans. 

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and if any research on live specimens has been conducted, then it was done outside of the Sol system after the collapse of the Delta Serpentis jump node. 

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. 

Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date.
"

4487, "During the Great War, as the annihilation of Earth seemed imminent, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization we now call the Ancients. Data excavated at the site enabled the allies to track and destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace.

It is assumed that the Terrans and Vasudans outside of the Sol system continued their research into the Ancients after the Great War, but all that's left of that research in Sol are scans of Ancient artifacts gathered by the Vasudan scientists in Altair."

I have a really bad feeling about the EFN's Project Sovereign. All the intel gathered by the Black Operations Department and Outer Rim Syndicate Intelligence indicates that Project Sovereign is refitting a Praetor-class carrier. Sensor readings from the construction site are similar to those recorded in Beta Aquilae when the Lucifer superdestroyer eliminated the Beta Aquilae Installation in 2335. Is the EFN trying to reverse-engineer Shivan flux cannon technology and install beam weapons on this supercarrier? I always thought that whichever side manages to produce a working version of this beam cannon will win the whole Rim Conflict. Up to now, both the EFN and the ORS failed in all their attempts to recreate flux cannon technology. Some of us hoped the Bamiyan Development Corporation engineers at Verdun station would solve the puzzle, but the only thing they successfully developed was a Shivan-inspired reactor coolant system later used on the Vitalius and Tychicus frigates and on the Galahad destroyers. Every prototype beam cannon constructed by the BDC engineers emitted too much excess heat. The energy requirements needed to power up just four beam cannons on a single ship were so ridiculously high that they severely impaired the other systems of the ship. That's why four H-variant Maul railcannons were mounted on the Galahad destroyers instead. If the EFN successfully reverse-engineered Shivan flux cannon technology and is currently mounting beam weapons onboard this Project Sovereign warship, then we've got a big problem on our hands."

The BOD's visit to my lab was a real nightmare. I don't know of any other unit as proud, arrogant, and impudent as those BOD idiots...well, maybe ORSI. Still, ORSI never broke any of the safety rules of our laboratory like those BOD guys. Anyway, Revenant King's subordinates brought a strange object onboard the Equilateral for us to study. I wasn't told where they got it, who created it or what the hell this thing actually is. I guess it's one of these things that I'm not allowed to know as long as I want to have my head still attached to my neck.

We've been trying to crack the object's external shell for eighteen hours. It's made of some kind of ultra-dense metallic fiber with a hexagonal, crystalline internal structure. I've never seen anything like it, but if the EFN are able to produce this material, I'm wondering why they don't armor their warships with it. Maybe they can't mass produce enough of it for all their ships? Anyway, the surface of this strange, boxy object so far remains impenetrable to all of our tools. It also resists lasers, plasma, meson streams, and even micro-substance disturbances. Since I wasn't authorized to study this object with 'conventional scientific tools,' I basically had no idea where I should start. We classified this thing as Object 419 under Category X -- a device of unknown origin and purpose. Really, pure fun. I do know one thing about it -- it's hollow. But whatever is inside it, if anything, is totally unknown. Object 419's length and width are both 112cm and it's 253cm high. It's a rectangular cuboid with beveled edges, has a seamless external sheathing and it's emitting high-frequency quantum pulses. The external sheath is made mostly of collapsed-core molybdenum, but also iridium and other elements I don't actually recognize. They're probably isotopes of previously discovered elements, but never before observed in a stable form. Perhaps they were obtained by methods unknown to ORS scientists...but why don't they match any known record? This case needs further investigation. The object has its own electrostatic and magnetic field, so it's basically levitating a few inches above the floor of our laboratory. I have this strange feeling that whoever designed this thing made every effort to seal it off and prevent any external force from opening it. More precise scanning detected the existence of a local subspace disturbance. Yi-Lin-Qui's subspace metrics indicated the regular amplitude of subspace vibration amounting to 41.73 EHz. As we all know, any subspace frequencies between 36.4 EHz and 241.18 EHz are stable, so Object 419 somehow interferes with the local intrasystem subspace field. So far, we don't know how or why. As Shivan subspace communication occurs on frequencies higher than 411.34 EHz, this fact rules out the possibility of this object being of Shivan origin. I need to get inside. I really didn't want to take this assignment, but now...my team and I really need to find out more about this thing."

I officially have no idea what the hell is going on here. I was wondering if I'm actually crazy. There are strange things happening all over the Equilateral. Computers started to randomly generate data of unknown origin. Air in the lab is ionizing spontaneously and generating electrostatic discharges. I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices in my head. I see things. Shivan things. Shivans and some tall, pale humanoid creatures. They're talking to me in a language I somehow understand, but...they're not actually speaking. I have this strange feeling that they're talking to me...telepathically. My people reported similar symptoms, so I'm not the only one experiencing this. We figured out that Object 419 is probably the cause of this phenomenon. We sealed it off in the isolated bunker. The hallucinations and electric discharges disappeared, but our computers are still generating this strange information. We tried manually overwriting it; we even resorted to globally resetting the ship's entire mainframe. Nothing worked. Object 419 seems to have taken over our computers, but also somehow provides them power. One computer overheated and the whole laboratory almost burned to hell before we managed to get the fire under control. Thank god no one was hurt. The rest of the computers are calculating tremendous amounts of data from time to time. Several petabytes in 30-minute-long intervals. Analysis suggests repeatable patterns of data processing. I've never seen anything like it. I guess Object 419 is trying to contact us. Or it's learning about us. We'll try to convert these calculation patterns into...a language. Yes. I guess ‘language' is the proper word. Whatever is hidden inside Object 419, it's processing data at an amazing rate...and seems to be understanding it all.

It doesn't make any sense at all. We've been working on it for two days now and we still don't understand. If our results are correct, we estimated more than five thousand distinct letters of the alphabet used by Object 419. I've never seen anything like it...and this number is still rising. Our computers are working at full efficiency. We have lots of words in this strange language of Object 419, but there are so many.... We don't know how to make any sense of it, regardless of the fact that Object 419 seems to ignore all our attempts to communicate with it. So far, more than 10 percent of the data calculated by Object 419 are more or less understandable to us. Whatever the EFN sealed inside this molybdenum container is definitely trying to examine us and that's probably why they sealed this thing off. So far, this language is...non-deterministic and therefore impossible to understand. It seems to consist of an insanely large amount of extremely precise concepts. No human language has similar construction and no human brain is able to communicate with this degree of precision. Whatever is inside this container, it's not of Terran nor Vasudan nor Ancient nor even Shivan origin."

Each word is equal to one shape of a quantum string, so the number of concepts in this language -- and the letters themselves -- are virtually infinite. Object 419 is actually trying to find a method to understand our way of communication, probably to talk with us. We never managed to open its molybdenum sheath, but if we manage to do so, it would likely make its computations much faster and without side effects. Its current capabilities are severely limited, but still we have no idea what this thing would do outside its sheath. Until we manage to understand it better, the sheath is at least slowing down its efforts. So far, we know that Object 419 is not using any kind of electron streams, radio waves or any other classic forms of wireless communication. It has the ability to establish quantum entanglement between itself and our computers, but its entanglements are disrupted by the molybdenum sheath. This level of technology is incredibly advanced.... We all have this strange feeling that Object 419 is...an intelligent and sentient being...maybe some kind of hyper-advanced AI. Its code is probably too complicated to be described and understood by our computers...or we're doing it all wrong. Perhaps it's using the Equilateral's computers because it has nothing better to work with...or because it has no way to properly interface with a human mind. Dr. Ming proposed something controversial yesterday. Object 419 may actually require a connection to a quantum computer to communicate efficiently. Something that assigns each sign with its correct information in real time. Something like...a human mind. The hallucinations we experienced before were probably Object 419's attempts to communicate with us directly, but after that apparently failed it switched to the computers onboard the Equilateral. Object 419 appears to be...a telepathic quantum computer with an incredibly advanced AI. It's interfering with everything in close proximity, creating some sort of network. A thinking network. Something like the Shivans. Something like the ancient concept of the Akasha Sphere. Something like...Project Blue Omega. Whoever designed this thing was surely interfacing with it directly with their thoughts. For the time being, we'll let Object 419 finish its computations. I feel we're getting close to a breakthrough."

It's open. Let me start at the beginning. Something strange happened (again). Object 419 finished its computations and we finally know the purpose it has been using our computers for during the last two weeks. But now the container is actually open. Its molybdenum armor was brutally ripped off from the inside. It was the last evidence we needed to support the theory that the EFN sealed it off, but...something tells me that the EFN needn't have bothered. I have this strange feeling that this green crystal inside the sheath is sentient and aware, but not hostile. Whatever it really is, it's currently...helping us power up the ship. The network of local quantum entanglements provides us an additional, wireless power management system. It resembles Nicola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower from the early 20th century, but where does its own energy come from? All readings of the Equilateral are nominal, so it's not using the reactor of the ship. This crystal must be somehow creating its own power. The crystal is levitating, emitting pulsating emerald light and it seems to be the core component of Object 419. The crystal is entwined by a network of metal wires and connected to a circular base. An identical, circular element is levitating above the top of the crystal. The internal structure of both elements is constantly changing, just like the network of metal wires. This strange, bright metal seems to be made up of elements that can act as a medium-temperature superconductor with minimal or even nonexistent resistance. This metallic compound was previously unknown to Terran or Vasudan science. The whole device was probably gathering energy for the last few weeks to break through the molybdenum shell, but now it's just sitting there after it finished its calculations.... And here's the strangest part. We just found out that Object 419 gathered and processed enormous amounts of information...from Terranet. It didn't use our conventional subspace routers, but the structure and size of the processed data matches other segments of the Terranet cloud, as if Object 419 could access it all at once, downloaded it and scanned it. Object 419 is...curious. It's curious about the ones studying it. It's curious about us."

It's time to reveal something very important for the accuracy of this log. We deliberately ignored the majority of standard laboratory procedures, as ordered by the Black Operations Department. The entire examination of Object 419, which BOD has now officially designated as “Mastermind,” was conducted at the personal request of two individuals known to me as “Revenant King” and “Prophet Omega”. This information is now included in the log, but the whole log is classified Level Rho instead of Level Nu.[Wasn't this log classified Level Upsilon at the start of Professor banner's log above at the start of Entry 4?] Mastermind is a hyper-advanced quantum computer of unknown origin, able to generate quantum entanglement with electronic hardware and human brains alike. Highly classified data proved many similarities to Shivan technology. [What similarities? Banner said in Entry 15 that Mastermind was definitely NOT of Shivan origin. So how could it be similar to Shivan technology?] Mastermind is made of biometal support components and a biocrystalline core. It is also equipped with a semi-sentient [Only “semi-sentient?”] conscious AI. The object is officially bioelectronic -- a perfect fusion of organic and mechanic elements. [WHAT organic elements? It's a crystal surrounded by metal wiring. There's no carbon here! So how could this damn thing have “organic elements???”] It's powered by an unknown, independent energy source probably located inside the green crystal core. Doctor Gerard, Doctor Saldana, Doctor Trevetick, and I all believe that Object 419 is actually an artificially created lifeform. The origin of Mastermind is unknown, but it seems to be some kind of artificial intelligence. Our goal now is to make contact with this being, and I think we finally know how...."

<<<RECORDING: ORD VERMILION DECK 24 - LAB 3>>>
Tessandras: Doctor Banner, are you sure of your theory?
Banner: I'm about 80% sure, Fleetmaster. Object 419 –- referred to by your investigators as Mastermind -- has been processing data and trying to communicate with us for the last five weeks. It used our computers to process various data about our species, civilization, culture and language...and I think we finally found a way to talk to it.
Tessandras: So...how exactly did you do it?
Banner: We attached quantum pulse receivers to interactive holopanels. We theorized that visualization would be the best way to communicate with Mastermind. Take a look, Fleetmaster. Even the very first results are already fascinating.
Tessandras: This looks like...a starmap of some sort?
Banner: Indeed. It looks very much like a starmap, marked with stable and unstable jump nodes. This central, yellow point in the middle is the Sol system. Object 419 is showing us some kind of strange disturbance of the local subspace field here in Sol. And here's another subspace disturbance field, with the Capella quadruple star system exactly in the middle. If I remember correctly, Capella was colonized by the GTA before the Great War, but we don't know what's going on there right now, apart from this subspace disturbance. This disturbance is expanding thousands of Astronomical Units from Capella's largest star....
Tessandras: There have been some...problems with precise subspace jumps in Sol for the past few days. Several shuttles and transports went off course after miscalculated jumps. This local disturbance could be the explanation. 
Banner: Indeed. Now we can see some subspace nodes collapsing and others forming. This is a direct repercussion of this Capella subspace cataclysm. The Altair system just lost its connection to Aldebaran. The same goes for Capella: it's now cut off from Vega and Epsilon Pegasi...but a new node is about to form. To the uncharted Zeta Puppis system.
Tessandras: And these indicators...what's going on here?
Banner: According to our astronomical data, this is Beta Volantis. A red dwarf.
Tessandras: Pretty close to the middle of the map. To Sol. And...something strange is going on here.
Banner: Yes. That's right, Fleetmaster. Something amazing is happening here. It's a subspace node! Beta Volantis is going to be connected with Sol!
Tessandras: Bloody hell! Doctor, what is the actual status of the node?!
Banner: Subspace vibration amplitude is 3.11 EHz and rising! We can expect stabilization of the Sol-Beta Volantis jump node in two to four hours. It's amazing!
Tessandras: I always knew that you were the right man for the job, Doctor. Helm, prepare to jump to Valhalla Station. I need to contact the Magistratorium directly. Doctor, continue observing this jump node and keep me informed."

4511, "    Record 179"

4512, "Banner: Finally...he's gone. Now we can begin extrapolating the starmap and gathering more intel. Let's compile all the nodes we're about to gain access to. This strange substance storm subspace phenomenon is our opportunity to regain access to our colony worlds.
Dalton: Um...Doctor? We've got activity in the Sol-Beta Volantis jump node. 
Banner: What? Show me.... Hmm, it's not a single activity. There are lots of them. Could they be...subspace jump signatures? In or out? 
Dalton: Can't tell. But there are a lot of them. Something's travelling between Sol and Beta Volantis right now. 
Gerard: It doesn't make any sense. The node is still stabilizing. Do we know the exact location of the jump node? 
Dalton: Negative. I might be able to get a probable location within an 80,000 cubic kilometer margin in an hour at the earliest. 
Banner: Damn it. Keep me updated, I'll send a report to Tessandras. The bastard's going to have a busy night as well, hah!"

4513, "    Record 180"

4514, "Gerard: Doctor! Look at the map! Something's wrong with the Capella system.
Banner: What's going on?
Gerard: The subspace magnitude of the Capella star system spiked when the disturbance began. But now it's...dropping dramatically.
Banner: What the fuck? 187,124 SU? A quadruple star system like Capella should be more than 250 thousand even before the disturbance added to it! And it's still dropping. Do you know what this means, Gerard?
Gerard: A supernova...but how? None of Capella's four stars are massive enough to go supernova. Something must have happened there.
Banner: The largest star, Capella Aa, went supernova and is now consuming the rest of the stars and planets. That's why the magnitude is dropping....
Dalton: Doctor? You should take a look at this....
Banner: What do you want, kiddo? We're kinda busy here.
Dalton: Mastermind just displayed something on the second holoboard. It seems to be a closeup of the Zeta Puppis system.
Banner: Indeed. Capella went supernova...and now it's connected to this system. Zeta Puppis is connected to Pollux, which is connected to Beta Volantis. Great job, kiddo! You've just found a way to our-- Wait. What are those red dots here?
Gerard: Lots of red dots. They're moving...
Dalton: ...to Sol--
Banner: Shit! Get Tessandras back here now! Every fucking second matters!"

4515, "  Project Black Omega (1)"

4516, "This document is property of the Black Operations Department - ExoTech Research Division. The following information is restricted level RHO. Unauthorized access will is punishable by martial court according to Point 431, yelded 24th May 2340.

Started by Galactic Terran Intelligence in 2335, Project Black Omega was a series of operations with the ultimate goal of capturing Human and Vasudan individuals with abnormal cognitive abilities, non-physical matter manipulation capacity, or unusual communication behaviour. The skills of those individuals, widely considered as subject of parapsychology were intended to be recognized, researched and reused for creating new technologies, or using the individuals themselves. The very limited success achieved by the project rendered Black Omega as a waste of resources and as a result unprofitable. The resources of Thanatos Station - HQ of Black Omega were redirected to an initiative known as Project Hades prior to the collapse of the Delta Serpentis - Sol jump node at the end of Great War. Still, the remaining data of Project Black Omega remained in the hands of crucial GTI personel, including Admiral Lenart Tessandras and Admiral Marcus Rossendarch.

The ExoTech Division of BOD restarted the project in 2351, after a mysterious explosion in Calixta city. Although the malfunction of core software of deuterium refinery 38 was revealed to the public as the official explanation, the field division of BOD researched one of bodies found in the refinery. Treated as a terrorist attack by a bomb-equipped GTI agent, the body was found at the epicentre the of explosion, while no signs of artifical explosives were ever found. Later intelligence actions revealed a secred program that was, in fact, an offspring of Black Omega. The terrorist attack in Calixta was conducted by a brainwashed agent with pyrokinetic abilities, maintained by experimental technology. No further examples of GTA and later EFN research of psionic powers were ever found, so the projest was likely to have been lost during the final collapse of the GTA, or it was presumbly continued by the EFN with no passable results."

4517, "  Project Black Omega (2)"

4518, "Conducted directly by Fleetmaster Tessandras, the Blue Omega Project started in 2352 and was progressing during the last years of of Rim Conflict. Through all these years ExoTech found and examined 1142 individuals with any kind of psionic capabilities. Common trait of all the test subjects were specific parts of DNA considered as remnances of viral remnance, actually active unlike other humans. However the theory of psionic abilities in homo sapiens as result of viral interference found no confirmation. Thanks to gathered psionics, ExoTech scientists succesfully researched the telekinetic and teleportation abilities of selected individuals to bend a local facture of subspace. Long term exposure to subspace travel was the official explanation accepted by some scientists, the telepaths were an even greater mystery. One notable fact was, that among the files of researched individuals, Aasira Esperanza Raji and Muhammad Al-Zardari names can be found with precognition and advanced telepatic abilities respectively. 

According to early the study of ExoTech scientists, telepathy was believed to be natural capability of establishing quantum entanglement between particles inside the synapses of two individuals, but further research has since brought this thesis into doubt. ExoTech researchers started to suspect, that human brains are in fact, constantly and spontaneously interacting on subconsciousness, empathic level even iver great distances. Sigmund Freud in the XIX century proposed an idea of a common subconsciousness, and theories with many similarities existed later but the concept was finally abandoned in the XXI century. Some of ExoTech researchers found many similarities also to controversial Etamnaki Project, and postulated similiarities between Human telepathy and the Shivan shared consciousness but on smaller, very limited scale. Project Trojan Horse, involving selected agents with telepathic abilities was rushed during the Martian War and Telepathic agents were equipped with biological implants based on Shivan technology, and later used to create a super-secret network inside the EFN fleets. Intel gathered, and sabotage performed by these agents later on revealed the EFN maneuvers in the asteroid belt, and allowed Fleetmaster Glenzmann and Fleetmaster El-Ghazzavi to attack the EFN fleet in the legendary Battle of Ceres. Project Blue Omega proven itself to be extremely valuable, and potentially lead to the ORS' eventual victory.

The Shivan Invasion in 2367 destroyed the labs as well as the many achievements of Blue Omega, but intel gathered over the years was essential for the rushing of Operation Moyses. Team of selected, technologically-enhanced telepaths known as Navigators were interfaced with a galactic starmap of unknown origin, and later set a barely safe course for the escaping Syndicate Exodus Fleet."

The most newest and most advanced version of the Prometheus cannon, the Locust was designed to confront heavily shielded EFN bombers attacking Vitalius-class frigates and Galahad-class destroyers. The relative low fire rate of the original Prometheus encouraged Massive Dynamics' engineers to develop the 191c cycle-firing version to improve its ability to pierce shields. Additionally this weapon proved to be extremely effective against subsystems. The Locust was originally issued only to the Black Operations Department, Syndicate Intelligence units and several elite fighter squadrons.

Derived straight from reverse-engineered Shivan technology less then a month after the execution of Operation Moyses, the Polyhydra is also based on a refined weapon dropped from the early ORS arsenal. Its first concept was intended to be used on Tychicus-class frigates to provide an even more superior anti-bomber screen for escorted destroyers, but UHI engineers dropped it in favour of standard plasma shotgun turrets to lower overall costs. Engineers onboard the ORFS Ida Lewis designed an amalgam of antimatter flak cannons based on data from the Samael-class destroyers to give the pilots of the Exodus Fleet a new and deadly weapon against the overwhelming Shivan fighters and bombers. The high production cost of antimatter projectiles excluded the Polyhydra from the warship mounting program, but after the discovery made by Ida Lewis engineers, factories onboard the factory ships were quickly adapted to obtain anti-hydrogenium. Factory ships renewed the production of Demolisher torpedos, but main goal of the engineers quickly changed. Gauss cannons can launch antimatter canisters with great speed and having reached the target its contents will annihilate surrounding matter creating splash damage. Version 111x of the Polyhydra cannon is the first area effect weapon available for Syndicate pilots. Extremely deadly against well-armored targets but ineffective against shields, the Polyhydra is the weapon of choice when used alongside an anti-shield weapon.

While a new variant of the Locust FFSP was the first answer to this problem, the Eviscerator was the second and ultimate. The Eviscerator was inspired by the plasma shotgun Turrets mounted on almost every Syndicate battleship. The Eviscerator fires a pulse of ionised particles, which are extremely effective against Shivan shields. A single pulse can strip off the shields of even the heaviest Shivan bombers and allow the delivery of tremendous amount of firepower from heavy weapons, the like Scythe, Incisor, Polyhydra or Redeemer to their hulls.

Each projectile travels at high speed until it comes within range of a specified target, where it detonates. The result is an area of effect barrage of explosive metal which completely surrounds the intended target. Proximity explosives only trigger near the firing ship’s target. One of the only drawbacks to this weapon is that it's quite hazardous to the firing ship at close range as the projectiles explode too soon after leaving their chambers.

Powered by double reactors, this extremely large cannon destroy a ship's electronics and is extremely effective when disabling and disarming large targets.

The Maul is an extremely effective, long range weapon used against Shivan capital ships. As the magnetic rails require an extremely an high power output to fire the massive bullets at the targets and with the bullets themselves having a caliber of more than 55m, the Maul can only be mounted on the largest capital ships in the ORS."

An extremely high power requirement combined with a long range necessitates a very long recharge time to prevent the rails from overheating and deforming. Also, the reactors of the Agneya-class frigate are unable to produce enough energy to power more frequent shots.

With very limited resources available, the Vortex’s engineers focused on minimizing its cost and production time as well as allowing it to be produced from minerals mined from asteroid fields. Shipmaster Donnelly, commander of the ORCa Graf Zeppelin, and pilots under his command who were issued the Vortex during its first combat deployment at the Battle of Uranus both described the Vortex as performing better than expected. With a fast-turning engine and an impressive neutron release warhead, the Vortex is a very workable solution to the demand for effective secondary weapons in the Exodus Fleet.

Rapiers played a crucial part during the Exodus from Sol, but only a handful of Rapiers survived the ordeal. Unfortunately, due to their complex design, the Exodus Fleet's factory ships currently lack the components to manufacture Rapiers in large numbers. As a result, the number of Rapiers in active service is on the decline. Despite that, a few squadrons of Rapiers are still stationed on the ORD Anjaneya and the ORD Demetrius."

The Heretic was first designed and deployed in 2367 in preparation for Operation Mjolnir, the Outer Rim Syndicate's preemptive attack on the Earth Federated Nations. However, as was seen during the Shivan invasion of Sol, the elite Heretic-class fighter is devastatingly effective against all known Shivan fighter and bomber classes. Two belt-loaded secondary banks allow the Heretic to carry a disproportionate amount of swarm missiles for its size, while maintaining a razor thin profile, high acceleration, maneuverability, and top speed. The Heretic has also an incredibly large afterburner capacity, though it is countered with a long recharge time. Unfortunately, only a relatively few Heretics were able to escape with the Exodus Fleet. An intense effort to retool the Exodus Fleet's factory ships for Heretic production is underway; the first allotment of new Heretics is expected to enter service in a few weeks' time."

Combining the Claymore's dogfighting capabilities with additional armor and bomb bays, the Krios can deliver its fearsome payload rapidly and still remain capable of engaging enemy fighters if need be.

Several dozen more Leviathan-class cruisers were refitted into Amalthea-class cruisers during and shortly following the Secession War by the GTA and the EFN, respectively. However, the Amalthea quickly became obsolete when the ORS-EFN arms race after the Secession War resulted in a completely new generation of Federate cruisers replacing the EFN's Amalthea cruisers. Bamiyan Development Corporation then covertly acquired the Amalthea's blueprints through corporate espionage and used them as a template to retrofit the Amalthea for use by the ORS Navy. With a more powerful reactor, a small launch bay able to house a small contingent of repair drones, and modern weapon systems including three railgun batteries and two defensive missile launchers, the modified Amalthea fully met the requirements of an ORS fleet asset. These new Amalthea cruisers were first introduced in 2343 to complement the 2nd Jovian Fleet's remote outposts in the Asteroid Belt and around Jupiter's moons. Since then, they continuously served in ORS units. Though their production was discontinued in favor of the Vitalius-class frigates, Amalthea cruisers continued to serve in every ORS fleet until the Shivan Invasion.

A signature warship of the Outer Rim Syndicate, the Vitalius-class frigate was developed shortly after the end of the Secession War. Having endured a costly victory in the Secession War, the ORS had suffered heavy losses confronting the Federate Navy and was in desperate need of a new generation of warships to ensure its control of the Outer Rim. Seeking to help fulfil this need, Bamiyan Development Corporation designed the Vitalius-class frigate with versatility in mind. Without any shipyard able to construct ships longer than 1 km, High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, the supreme commander of the Syndicate Navy, requested a new warship class able to be constructed in the small shipyards spread throughout the Outer Rim. As the first ship since the end of Unification War classified as a frigate, the Vitalius wields firepower exceeding the old Orion class despite being only half its size. It has become a mainstay of the Syndicate fleet and was involved in every major military operation in all three stages of the Rim Conflict. A total of 258 Vitalius-class frigates were constructed in Syndicate shipyards and almost 150 survived to see the beginning of the Shivan Invasion of Sol. 

After the Exodus from Sol, the Vitalius became an integral part of the Exodus Fleet with its heavy rail cannons, Revenant torpedo launchers, and fast-recharging jump drive. Despite being equipped with intersystem jump drives, the Vitalius was designed to perform only short-range missions inside the Sol system. The small cargo space onboard places a limit on its operational range, making the Vitalius fully dependent on regular resupplies. The majority of the remaining Vitalius-class frigates were assigned to constantly escort Colony Fleet ships and even the Vitalius frigates forming the battle groups of the Roaming Fleet require logistical support to carry out military operations far away from the rest of the fleet. Although the Vitalius is equipped with a hangar bay able to house a single wing of four fighters, only 35% of the Vitalius-class frigates in the Exodus Fleet have a full fighter compliment onboard. Replenishing the fighter corps on destroyers and carriers is a higher priority, so many Vitalius frigates are forced to go without internal fighter support."

The crowning achievement of United Heavy Industries, the Tychicus-class heavy frigate was designed in 2349 as a more specialized complement to the versatile Vitalius. At that time, Syndicate Intelligence was intensively spying on EFN shipyards and factories. The Federation responded to the mass production of the Vitalius with new warship classes and new tactics. Therefore, a new heavy assault frigate was needed to confront the greatest EFN destroyers and carriers and assist ORS command centers which were located on Orion destroyers at that time. The Tychicus was designed to fulfill both roles and to fulfill them with deadly effectiveness. It shares a simple cheap spaceframe with the Vitalius, but this is where similarities end. The Tychicus is meant to be superior to all other frigates in every aspect. Its signature weapon is the Trinity System consisting of an Oculus Heavy Plasma Driver, an Archangel Ion Cannon and a next-gen Newton-BFR-21a Reactor to power both components. The Newton's efficiency vastly exceeded initial expectations with its huge power reserves, so the original project was complemented with deadly Revenant torpedo launchers and an advanced anti-bomber weapon known as the Ion Lance. An experimental target-sync software coordinates the fire of Ion Lances making them a nightmare for Federate fighter and bomber pilots. A simulation carried out in 2352 showed that with the Oculus piercing even the heaviest armor and the Archangel neutralizing subsystems and annihilating shields, a task force of three Tychicus frigates is capable of taking down a Lucifer-class superdestroyer and able to withstand multiple bomber runs at the same time. 

The few Tychicus frigates that survived the Shivan Invasion of Sol belong to the Heavy Fleet and are under the command of Fleetmaster Aasira Raji, ORD Anjaneya. Their primary objective is to assist the colony ships and protect them at any cost."

The newest Syndicate long range assault frigate has a history that dates back to the pre-Great War era. The Agneya was originally manufactured as an Explorer-class mining vessel at the beginning of Terran space exploration in 20XX and was redeployed in 2338 to collect minerals in the Outer Rim to satisfy the needs of the new GTA warship construction program. Following the events of the Secession War and the internal collapse of the GTA, many Agneya vessels were captured by Syndicate forces in the Outer Rim and re-used to supply its rapidly expanding fleets and flourishing industry during the years of economic boom. Their heyday lasted for more than two decades. The events of the Martian War resulted in the rapid development of the Hephaestus factory ships that combine mobility with high automation and the ability to extract minerals on the spot using mining drones. Although mostly relieved of their old duties, Agneyas were still used by mining and logistic companies without sufficient funds for a factory ship. They continuously played their small part as secondary mining vessels...until desperate times arrived and showed that old heavy miners might yet be of use. 

When the desperate ORS push to capture the Beta Volantis jump node failed and Shivan forces began to advance further into ORS and EFN space the Sol system, a bold plan was introduced to give the Syndicate a new unconventional weapon of destruction against the forthcoming Shivan armada. The thick heavy armor meant to sustain the rain of space rocks in dense asteroid fields had now to resist the rain of red lasers and beam cannons and a forward mining laser was hastely replaced with a colossial long-range variant of the standard Maul-class Heavy Rail Cannon. The Agneya became a symbol of its time - raw, unfinished, suffering from construction drawbacks and reactor overheating, but armed with monstrous death-dealing weaponry and was send to reinforce the crumbling lines of the ORS fleets against the overwhelming enemy. The Agneya is intended to perform long-range artillery strikes against Shivan warships while remaining out of their beam range. A couple of Agneyas with a proper fighter escort is capable of taking down a destroyer and its entire defensive complement on its own. However, the lack of proper anti-bomber armaments makes the frigate extremely vulnerable to bomber strikes and its subspace jumping capabilities are significantly reduced in comparison with the Vitalius and Tychicus frigates. 

Two dozen of the Agneyas were rearmed to take part in the defense of Sol and half of them survived the Exodus from Sol. Now they are used in crucial engagements to break Shivan formation or soften their defenses before the deployment of other warships."

From all these new solutions, the Syr Darya carrier was born. 34 Syr Darya carriers were constructed and played a major part in numerous engagements reinforcing ORS warships and supply convoys with fighters while they remained far away from the war zone. During the Shivan invasion the Syndicate equipped the carriers with a pair of centerline mounted light rail cannons to enhance its escort capabilities and allow it to assist the refugee convoys.

Seven Orion-class destroyers, including two under construction at the time, were trapped in the Sol system when the Sol-Delta Serpentis node collapsed. Later, three of remaining Orion-class destroyers – the GTD Ironclad, the GTD Lazarus and the GTD Apam Napatis – became the flagships of three fleets of the newly formed Outer Rim Syndicate. 

With only three heavy railguns, the Orion-class destroyers became mobile command centers rather than line destroyers and offensive operations were reassigned to the Vitalius-class frigates. The introduction of the Galahad-class destroyer demoted relegated the remaining Orions to the role of secondary heavy carrier. Obsolete construction forced the placement of railguns in positions which prevents the ship being able to focus all its firepower in one direction. Despite that, the Orion is still one of the most powerful ships in the ORS armada.

Classified as a destroyer, although significantly exceeding its standard parameters, this 3.1-kilometer-long behemoth is comparable with the SD Lucifer in terms of size, primary weapon configuration and fighting capabilities. High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, ORD Lazarus requested a new destroyer for the Syndicate after Valhalla Station was retrofitted with a next generation shipyard finally able to construct capital ships. The Galahad is designed to be the response for EFN's Praetor battlecarrier, to outmatch it in almost every aspect and match its legendary fighterbay capacity. The Galahad has everything it needs to be a mobile command center for an entire fleet. At the same time, it is a superheavy siege platform, intended to unleash hell on any Federate installation or stop any offensive on Syndicate worlds and crucial sectors. No single Galahad was ever destroyed by Federation forces, despite their numerous, ruthless and futile attempts. The first constructed warship of this class, the ORD Thor, under command of High Fleetmaster Christopher Glenzmann, became flagship of the 1st Jovian Fleet and the entire Outer Rim Syndicate Navy. It was destroyed in a desperate stand against an overwhelming Shivan armada laying siege to the ORS capital world of Europa. 

Despite being heavily influenced by the Orion destroyers, the Galahad has little in common with any Great War-era design. This superheavy warship is a monstrosity in terms of firepower, covered by almost impenetrable titanium reactive armor plating. The main tools of destruction wielded by the Galahad are rapid-firing Maul rail cannons including seven triple-barreled railgun batteries in a crown configuration supported by four Revenant torpedo tubes and four forward firing heavy Maul-B batteries for strike missions. The Anti-fighter screen of the Galahad is more than twice that of the Orion's. As a dedicated flagship class, it is equipped with a cavernous hangar bay housing up to 50 wings of fighters and bombers. The destroyer shares the reputation of almost the perfect warship along with the Tychicus-class heavy frigate, and despite extremely high production costs, the Syndicate constructed seven Galahad-class warships. 

The majority of these fearsome warships including the Thor itself were destroyed during the Shivan invasion. Two surviving Galahad-class destroyers – the ORD Demetrius, former flagship of the 2nd Jovian Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Hector Caliphtys, and the ORD Anjaneya, the flagship of the 4th Uranian Fleet commanded by Fleetmaster Aasira Raji, later formed the backbone of the Escort Fleet.

The history of the Abraham colony ship, originally designed as a heavy fleet carrier, dates back to the decisive moments of the final stage of the Rim Conflict. The Battle of Ceres resulted in tremendous damage being taken by the EFN fleet resulting in an opening for the ORS offensive of the Inner Rim. With Syndicate ground forces advancing on Mars and strike wings performing long range raids on Federate installations orbiting Earth itself, the Magistratorium and ORS High Command began to plan for further expansion after the Federation was defeated and Syndicate domination in Sol was complete. They requested a ship that would be center of operations for the entire Sol system and beyond if subspace connection with Delta Serpentis or any other system was established. This task was dedicated to joint consortium of Massive Dynamic, Bamiyan Development Corp and United Heavy Industries. The result was the Abraham supercarrier. 

Six supercarriers were under construction at the time when the Shivans invaded. After the Syndicate's attempt to stop the Shivan advance at the Beta Volantis jump node failed, Fleetmaster Caliphtys issued an order to secretly retrofit the Abrahams as colony ships - real floating cities and safe harbours for survivors from destroyed planets and space stations to evacuate as many surviving refugees as possible. The Syndicate's primary shipyards and unlimited resources from their orbital depots were assigned to this deadly race against the clock and managed to deliver three out of six colony ships before they were overrun. Ark-01 Abraham, Ark-02 Adrastus and Ark-06 Inquisitor -- later renamed the Spirit of Hope -- were then directed to the most densely populated ORS worlds with a simple goal - collect as many survivors as its cavernous hangar bays and numerous decks could accommodate. These vast numbers of people were later segregated according to their skills. Engineers, medics and other kinds of specialists were assigned to work on board the colony ship or other vessels while the rest of the refugees were put in hypersleep. 

With cavernous fighterbays, factory facilities and advanced combat information centers replaced with extensive hydroponics bays and numerous hibernation capsules, the Abraham-class carriers are now officially classified as colony ships and became the absolute centerpieces of the Syndicate Colony Fleet. Each contains 150,000-200,000 hibernation capsules and more than 30,000 active personnel. The Colony Ships colony ships provide 80% of the food and water supplies for the fleet, advanced medical help and a home for the majority of civilians living in the Colony Fleet. Despite the intensive efforts of shipyard personnel, none of the colony ships' retrofits was ever fully completed and many of their decks remain unused and without an atmosphere. Preparations to use these decks are carried out slowly as the colony ships are almost constantly on the move and under threat of Shivan attack. According to optimistic estimates it will take at least nine months to complete all planned retrofits and supply the entire fleet with sufficient amounts of food. As they are home to more than half of the Exodus Fleet's population, the colony ships constantly remain under the vigilant guard of Escort Fleet's autonomous unit - Heavy Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Aasira Raji. 

The colony ship Spirit of Hope was selected as the political capital of the Exodus Fleet and the seat of the re-nominated Syndicate Magistratorium led by High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari. The apocalypse did not make the Syndicate's political factions disappear and their interests and influences are concentrated here. The Upper upper decks are mostly occupied by the Magistratorium's administration and a team of scientists called Navigators who use a powerful cluster of quantum computers to select the path for the fleet chart the Exodus Fleet's course under the guidance of High Magistrate Al-Zardari. The Spirit of Hope has also become a cultural and scientific center, home to science labs, research centers, cinemas, theaters, seat of the corporations, churches and non-government organizations."

Ezakiya-Boherr Heavy Industries' largest and most ambitious project, the MCCV-2-class factory ships are some of the most important vessels in the ORS fleet. Designed during the Martian War as a response to the EFN's aggressive strikes against Syndicate infrastructure, the MCCV-2 Hephaestus-class factory ship is a modular design that can be reconfigured into a command center, logistic hub, vehicle dock, heavy excavator, drilling station, and refinery, though it is seen most often as a mobile factory and field manufacturing center. Every day thousands of missiles, torpedoes, and caches of spare parts leave the hangar bays of these vessels. Although it is an almost 2-km-long starship with capital-grade armor, the Hephaestus still requires protection against Shivan bombers and warships. The Hephaestus can serve as a self-sufficient production center, producing and deploying mining drones from raw materials collected from asteroid fields. Only 4 ships of this class – the ORFS Hephaestus, the ORFS Qatna, the ORFS Ida Lewis, and the ORFS Denoran – managed to escape Sol with the Exodus Fleet.

The Syndicate began drone production on a large scale in the factory ships during the Martian War and used them to support its mobile industry. Drone contingents are present in large numbers on factory ships, haulers and mobile shipyards. After the Exodus from Sol, they were restored to their primary role of extracting minerals from asteroid fields and deliver them straight to the factory ships.

Constructed in low orbit of Jupiter in 2246-2248 to oversee gas extraction carried out by the Jovian Collective Consortium, at the end of the 23rd century it became the seat of the Jovian government. The Unification War and the resulting formation of the Galactic Terran Alliance did not diminish its significance as it was selected to house the Jovian GTA governors office. 

Before the Delta Serpentis node collapse the station combined the roles of informal political center for Jupiter colonies and a huge freighter production facility. When tensions grew in the Outer Rim after the GTA enforced the execution of the Great Perseverance Plan, the Valhalla secretly began construction of a new insurgent fleet that would later confront the GTA armada in the Secession War. 

After the ORS' pyrrhic victory the Conglomerates of Jupiter offered Valhalla as the political capital of the Syndicate and primary seat of the newly-formed Magistratorium with High Magistrate Helena Smithsson contacting Conglomerate Lin Apis to begin negotiations. Two months later, the Valhalla was outfitted with the most advanced command facility in order to govern extensive Syndicate space and monitor the transit of both civilian and military spaceships. The Valhalla became the core of the Outer Rim Syndicate, home of its government and military headquarters. Before long ORS High Command started to refer to themselves as “Valhalla Command.” Before the Shivan invasion, the Valhalla was an almost self-sufficient city in space equipped with the largest shipyard in ORS-controlled space. 

The station itself has always been protected by heavy armor and designed to withstand the bombardment of enemy warships, but the Syndicate never decided to arm the Valhalla with strong defensive capabilities due to constant presence of the two most powerful ORS destroyers - ORD Thor and ORD Demetrius. When the Syndicate's ultimate victory seemed to be only a matter of time after the Battle of Ceres, High Fleetmaster Christopher Glenzmann ordered Gerace Corporation engineers to arm the station with numerous railgun batteries to provide the station with self-sufficient defenses and release its escort battlegroup escort battle group to participate in the forthcoming final assault on Earth. Retrofitting was cancelled during the Shivan Invasion and instead the Valhalla's railgun batteries were removed and placed on several surviving Orion-class destroyers to convert them into heavy assault warships. The station was successfully evacuated in 2367. The Syndicate government was later re-established on the colony ship ORCo Spirit of Hope while the Syndicate's High Command relocated to the Demetrius, Fleetmaster Caliphtys' flagship."

This huge modular installation was designed at the beginning of Terran colonization of the Outer Rim, long before the formation of the Syndicate. It was intended to provide a living habitat for up to 700,000 residents but also serve as a logistics and trade center as well as a base for long range expeditions and mining operations. Sky Gardens were often the first Terran bases constructed in a newly colonized sector – initially lonely islands among the cold vastness of space – then eventually surrounded by a network of colonies, mines, refineries and supply depots. Because of their enormous logistical capacity, they usually remained political, trade and financial centers for the surrounding areas even after the majority of the population and industry moved to other space stations and planetary colonies. 

During the Martian War, Sky Garden installations were targets of EFN suicide attacks on their strategic spaceports and supply depots. The most infamous attack was the destruction of the ORI Heaven's Gate, a Sky Garden-class installation in high orbit over Neptune, in June 2351. Later, during the Shivan Invasion of Sol, the Sky Gardens became death traps for everyone aboard when they were attacked by Shivan warships.

The Syndicate retrofitted their Endymion stations with cruiser-grade armor and new weaponry. Despite that Endymion class installations were still fragile to Federation attacks, and long-range communication inside ORS-controlled space was often disrupted by attacks on Endymion installations. The Syndicate later used this same tactic when invading EFN space. The Endymion may be retrofitted to various other roles, and before the Shivan invasion they sometimes acted as local outposts.

The Evangelist was designed in the early 2340s to combine the role of a small patrol carrier and a versatile cruiser suited for both atmospheric flights and recon missions in open space. Lightly armed and armored, this vessel was initially not intended to be a first line unit. However, during the EFN's preparations for the Martian War, an atmospheric craft was needed to provide a superiority role in low atmosphere, launch fighter and bomber strikes and even perform bombardments on its own. To accomplish this, the Evangelist cruisers had their compact hangar bay retrofitted to be capable of housing a full squadron of fighters instead of a single wing. These new cruisers were the backbone of EFN operations against the independent Martian provinces and ORS ground forces during Operation Iron Rain. Evangelists remained widely used and mass-produced after the Martian War when Mars was divided between the EFN and the ORS as the Federation needed to ensure its dominance above the Red Planet for future conflicts with the Syndicate. Evangelists remain the only known cruiser class to be able to house fighter squadrons.

Although the last Evangelists left the shipyard in 2362, many of them were once again retrofitted, this time with enhanced armor and additional anti-bomber weaponry as well as Scimitar long-range torpedoes.

The Viscount was hastily retrofitted with additional plasma cannons and turrets, turning the cruiser into a formidable opponent for bomber wings and Amalthea cruisers. With proper bomber support, the Viscount was even capable of withstanding an attack from a Vitalius-class frigate. 

The Viscount is armed with a frigate-grade plasma cannon and two pairs of smaller plasma cannons placed on the front. Just like every EFN warship, the Viscount has extended anti-fighter weaponry consisting of multiple plasma turrets across its superstructure. Tactical Arbiters advise attacking the Viscount from either the front or the rear, as both the front plasma cannons and engines are more vulnerable to attack than the rest of the ship.

5386, "Earth Federated Nations - Solomon Frigate

A light frigate and mainstay of the Earth Federation fleet, the Solomon was heavily influenced by the ORS' famous Vitalius-class frigate. However, the Solomon is a significantly different design because of the way it uses its offensive potential. The Solomon relies heavily on its ventral VLS torpedo tubes, armed with long-range Scimitar swarm torpedoes - a weapon widely considered to be a nightmare when it comes toe-to-toe with Syndicate warships. Extremely fast and accurate with the ability to swarm its target, the Scimitar is much more successful than even the long-range variant of the Syndicate Revenant swarm torpedo. The first incarnation of the Solomon was intended to be a rapid strike vessel, equipped with Archangel Ion Cannons for striking against a target's electronics, point defenses and engines while using Scimitar torpedoes as its main assault weapon. Later variants were equipped with standard EFN burst plasma cannons to boost the frigate's effectiveness against armoured targets. The Archangel was dropped by the EFN military and later Massive Dynamic engineers modified the Archangel design creating a weaponry for the Tychicus. 

Solomon-class frigates remained the basic standard Federate frontline unit until the Shivan incursion, although since Admiral Walker's reforms in the early 2360s they began to play a long-range support role for the newly-introduced EFFg Vidar heavy frigate. Plasma cannons are considered underpowered by ORS tactical arbiters, but despite that, they should never be underestimated. Pilots are advised to avoid the longe-range Pulse Lances mounted on the Solomon's triple turrets. Destroying the ventral torpedo tubes is critical when Syndicate forces battle Solomon-class frigates. Don't get distracted by the main plasma driver of the Vidar, as the Scimitar torpedoes of the Solomon will destroy the main cannons of our warships much faster than any weapon of the Vidars."

Justifiably considered to be an equivalent of the Tychicus-class escort frigate, the Vidar is longer, heavier, has a larger fighterbay but it's also considerably slower. The Vidar was also the first EFN battleship equipped with a heavier version of the plasma driver used frequently on almost every larger vessel in Federation fleets. The first version with the cannon mounted underneath the bow of the ship quickly proven itself to be too vulnerable to ORS Revenant torpedoes and supressing railgun fire. Later versions of the Vidar frigate had this cannon mounted inside the hull. 

Although heavy armoured, the Vidar was designed with versatility in mind. Its hangar bay allows it to perform a strike carrier role, but the strong forward arsenal is its signature capability. A cluster of Scimitar torpedo tubes, heavy plasma driver and a pair of secondary plasma cannons gives this vessel tremendous punch when attacking forward. Despite not being as devastating as the Tychicus' famous pair of heavy cannons, the Vidar must be considered as an opponent every bit as deadly as its Syndicate counterpart. Tactics used by the Federation Navy in the recent war featured Vidar-class warships used in shock-jump strikes influenced by the SD Lucifer during the Great War. The ORS lost several Vitalius frigates and Syr Darya carriers from shock-jump attacks. This EFN strategy, however, helped us better prepare for Shivan attacks during their invasion."

By the outbreak of the Martian War Praetors had already become a key part of the EFN fleet and played a crucial part in Federate attacks against the Outer Rim. Their position as a second-line command center remained unchallenged until the Federation's end. 

More than 3 klicks in length, this fearsome vessel houses hundreds of fighters and bombers in its cavernous hangar bays. A single Praetor battlecarrier could launch and coordinate dozens of fighter and bomber raids simultaneously thanks to next-generation scanners and communication systems. It is a dedicated advanced command facility and operates mostly behind the front lines commanding battlegroups battle groups of heavy cruisers and frigates against ORS forces. However, should the situation demand it, the Praetor can enter combat itself and strike a deadly blow with its 16 heavy plasma cannon batteries.

The centerline beam cannon of the Moloch is a serious threat, but as Shivan warships may differ between each other, only 75% of Moloch frigates utilize beams, while the other 25% have anti-fighter plasma cannons instead. Additionally, initial scans of the Moloch have shown a large, skeletal internal structure linked to the beam cannon. This fact led our analysts to the theory that the Moloch was retrofitted numerous times through its history and this beam cannon of the Moloch was once some kind of long range plasma weapon probably developed for artillery strikes or maybe even planetary bombardment, and was used to wipe out some space-faring races many millennia ago. Shivan Juggernauts have demonstrated planet bombardment ability during their invasion of Sol, so the Moloch was no longer needed in this role. 

During the close skirmishes, pilots are advised to avoid flak cannons of the Moloch. The frigate is not armed with anti-fighter beams and its beam cannons are not as powerful as the Daeva's and Armaros' beam cannons, so a precise strike by even a single heavy fighter wing can easily disarm a Moloch."

5424, "SFg Armaros"

5425, "Shivans - Armaros Frigate

While the Moloch fills a variety of roles, the Armaros-class frigate is a purely offensive vessel likely designed to confront enemies of comparable size. The Armaros is the most heavily armored Shivan vessel of its size and it's often accompanied by numerous bomber wings. The Shivans often use Armaros-class frigates as decoys for the main cannons of our Vitalius-class frigates, leaving an open window in their point defense screens for a bomber strike. The frigate-grade main beam cannon of the Armaros should be taken down ASAP during combat with Syndicate vessels, and pilots are advised to evade the plethora of anti-fighter beams and plasma cannons."

5426, "SD Samael"

5427, "Shivans - Samael Heavy Destroyer

Not many Terrans have survived a fight with a Samael-class destroyer, but the handful who did described this ship with a single word: monster. The fearsome Samael-class destroyer, a vessel with immense forward firepower is the heaviest and deadliest Shivan destroyer encountered by Syndicate forces. With 2 primary and 4 secondary beams in an even more powerful configuration than the Ravana's, this ship can easily massacre smaller capital ships. Many ORS and EFN frigates and cruisers have been lost to shock-jump attacks by Samael-class destroyers. In a direct engagement with a Samael, current Syndicate tactics are to deploy Agneya-class artillery frigates or several bomber wings to disarm it, then have Vitalius-class or Tychicus-class frigates engage the Samael once its weapons are negated. The very small hangar bay of the Samael clearly suggests that the Samael is a pure siege beam platform, designed to be deployed to the largest battles and survive. Our analysts believe the Samael is a new, state-of-the-art vessel specifically designed for the Sol invasion. The Samael is at least equal in power to our Galahad-class destroyers."

5428, "SCN Kali"

5429, "Shivans - Kali Comm Node

This strange device appears to be a Shivan communication node. Encountered in several Shivan-held star systems, these nodes emit strange subspace signals and quantum pulses for no purpose that we can determine. The device itself has no stationary parts and an eight axis symetry. 

Accorting to the intel gathered by the BOD and Navigators onboard the Spirit of Hope, the Shivan communication network is based on the quantum phenomena known by humans as Entanglement. The information transmitted between Shivan warships seems to be operating on a quantum level, and occurs in real time. Every unit in any armada knows about state of each other without any time lag. This theory explains the perfect coordination found in the Shivan battlegroups during their invasion of Sol in 2367. 

The usage of quantum entanglement by Shivan forces is a still subject of debate for our tactical analysts. One of other theories is of the old and actually ancient concepts inspired by the hinduist Akasha Sphere, that treat the Shivan mentallity as a single organism bounded at the quantum level with unusual behaviors. The proposed idea of a Shivan network mentions a common information quantum disc with no single point of failure, but rather decentralized throughout the galaxy, similar to TerraNet used by the GTA, EFN and ORS, but on much greater scale. In a difference to its Terran counterpart, the Shivans would use quantum pulses of pure energy instead of encoding information in a binary form. This way every piece of information ever gathered by the Shivans would be recoverable no matter when, where, and who wants to recover it. Navigators onboard the Spirit of Hope are working on devices that will let us intercept information from the Shivan network based on ETAK device developed by the GTI. If this theory is actually true, we believe it will, sooner or later, lead us to a great advantages over the Shivan pursuit and help avoiding Shivan-infested systems in the near future.

Given that we can only speculate about how Shivan communication actually works, the purpose of the Kali devices remains unknown. Nonetheless, pilots are instructed to destroy these comm nodes at every opportunity since any disruption of Shivan communication can only help our war effort. As with Rahu gas miners, anyone attacking a Kali should proceed with caution, however, as these volatile devices create a massive explosion when destroyed."

Syndicate pilots have found the Aeshma heavy assault fighter weak and easy to kill. This rare and strange vessel is present with modern Shivan warships like the Ravana-class destroyers. A minimalistic design with a single secondary bank, it was probably designed to attack slower targets like transporters and freighters. Although encountered recently, Syndicate tactical arbiters regard the Aeshma as an obsolete design."

Maras are fast, have good primary firepower and are an extremely deadly threat to Syndicate pilots.

The Astaroth is a deadly interceptor and escort fighter and has been deployed alongside both Ravana- and Moloch-class warships.

During Operation Moyses, ORS pilots of light fighters targeting Nephilims were effectively stymied by the bombers' powerful turrets."

The Seraphim is a deadly foe for ORS pilots. Two turrets, enormous primary firepower, and an extremely large torpedo payload makes the Seraphim a nightmare for fighters escorting warships and convoys. The Seraphim is almost indestructible to pilots flying Encantona fighters, so defeating a wing of Seraphim requires heavier fighters like the Rapier. A common tactic of Seraphim-class bombers is to disengage from their target when attacked by escort fighters and focus instead on the escort their attackers."

The only known example of a Shivan transport, the Azrael is a lightly armed vessel operating deep behind the front lines. Before the Exodus from Sol, Terrans encountered Azrael-class vessels several times during the Great War and once as part of a supply depot near the Beta Volantis jump node. Pilots are highly advised to destroy Azraels as they are often loaded with Shivan personnel traveling to and from ships of their armada."

The strange Asmodeus-class freighter is a mystery for ORS tactical arbiters. An Asmodeus was the first Shivan ship boarded by Terrans during the Great War. However, the Asmodeus freighters belonging to the Tyrant's fleet are different from their Great War-era counterparts. The strangest feature of the original Asmodeus freighters was their gold lighting, when most Shivan vessels have red lighting.

Another enemy first encountered during the Great War, the Lilith became famous for its destroyer grade main beam cannon, able to destroy a Vitalius-class frigate with just a few salvos. Initial scans of Lilith cruisers show that the reactor mounted onboard is unable to produce enough energy for the Lilith centerline beam cannon, so the cruiser's energy managing mechanism remains a mystery. Whatever the explanation, the Lilith is a significant threat to Syndicate light and medium vessels. The Revenant anti-capital swarm torpedo was modified specifically to confront Lilith cruisers. As the Revenant has a longer range than the Lilith's beam cannon, ORS forces are now able to confront Lilith-class cruisers. Bomber and fighter pilots should beware of its heavy armor and its single anti-fighter beam placed beneath the main engine"

5468, "SC Rakshasa"

5469, "Shivans - Rakshasa Medium Cruiser

With triple the firepower of a Cain, the Rakshasa is another medium cruiser in the Shivan armada. Performing a similar role to the Daeva cruiser, the Rakshasa has more anti-capital ship firepower but less anti-fighter weaponry than the Daeva. Equipped with a single anti-fighter beam and three pulse cannons, the Rakshasa is a significantly greater threat than the Cain in terms of offensive potential. Tactical arbiters still debate the true purpose of the Rakshasa. While the Daeva is often seen escorting larger vessels, the Rakshasa often leads groups of other cruisers during assaults on Syndicate vessels. The signature feature of the Rakshasa is its asymmetric armament of three beam cannons on claw turrets, which are accompanied by a pulse turret on the fourth claw. The three beam cannons are placed on very small turrets making them virtually impossible to destroy without the use of a splash damage weapon. While the Shivans are known for constructing asymmetric vessels such as the infamous Ravana-class destroyer, the reason for the asymmetry of the Rakshasa's primary armament remains a mystery. Our analysts believe the Rakshasa is a warship that never came into its final stage of development since maintaining four beam cannons would cause its reactor to overheat. "

5470, "SC Cain"

5471, "Shivans - Cain Cruiser

The weakest and most common Shivan warship, the Cain cruiser was the first Shivan warship ever encountered by Terran forces. Cain class cruisers appear to be secondary warships in the Shivan armada that invaded the Sol system in 2367. Despite being easy prey for our light frigates, Cain cruisers rarely perform stand-alone missions, usually providing assistance to other cruisers or frigates instead. When compared to modern ORS and EFN designs, the Cain is weaker than even the Amalthea cruiser. Analysts think the Cain is an outdated warship that is no longer under construction, designed thousands of years ago to confront a race that had not developed strong armor for their warships or any kind of advanced anti-ship weapon. However, shipmasters and pilots should be concerned about the single cruiser-grade beam cannon with a wide angle of fire and the anti-fighter beam beneath the engines."

5472, "SD Demon"

5473, "Shivans - Demon Destroyer

The Demon-class destroyer is probably the oldest destroyer in the Shivan armada. With almost impenetrable armor and two hangar bays, the Demon has always been a tough nut to crack for Terran forces. The Demon-class destroyers that attacked Sol are significantly different from their Great War-era counterparts. A pair of large, destroyer-grade beam cannons are present on the sides of the ship and an additional smaller beam on the top of the hull makes the Demon a deadly opponent for every warship in the Syndicate fleet. Despite that, Demons rarely enter close combat, preferring to launch bomber raids instead. This has led us to believe that the Demon is the equivalent of the Praetor battlecarrier, but following the official GTA designation from the Great War it is referred to as a destroyer."

The Ravana-class destroyer is one of the most terrifying Shivan warships ever encountered. Its odd-looking, asymmetric shape houses a pair of frontal beam cannons and another pair of smaller, support beams on the rear part of the hull. The Ravana appears to be a dedicated warship killer. The Syndicate lost numerous ships from the main beams of shock-jumping Ravanas during the Sol invasion. Although equipped with deadly beam weapons, the Ravana's armor is the lightest among Shivan destroyers and its jump drive recharges slowly. With two hangar bays each smaller than the Demon's hangar bays, after losing its main beams the Ravana represents a rather minor threat and could be easily be overwhelmed by torpedoes and suppressing railgun fire. Our analysts treat consider the Ravana as to be a disposable single strike warship, designed for one devastating shock-jump attack, so it is not meant to survive if it fails to destroy its target with its initial attack."

With armor that cannot be penetrated even by our Maul-17c railguns and Oculus plasma cannons, these fearsome vessels could very easily wipe out the last remnants of the human race. Sixteen ships of this class attacked the Sol system, and twelve were present during the bombardment of Earth. With 4 gargantuan beam cannons that seem to defy the laws of thermodynamics, a single Sathanas-class juggernaut can destroy any known ship with only a single volley of its impressive weapons. Vessels of this class emit a unique subspace signature, perhaps some kind of massive command and control system for the rest of their armada. While Sathanas juggernauts are notorious for their massive forward firepower, a few juggernaut variants equipped with secondary side beam cannons, such as the SJ Tyrant, have been sighted."

Despite being smaller than the Pluto, the Rahu seems to be much more effective at extracting deuterium from gas giants or perhaps even raw nebular gas and refining it into fuel for their ships. Rahu gas miners should be treated as an absolute priority for Roaming Fleet forces since every opportunity to harm Shivan supply lines should be taken to disrupt the pursuit of the Tyrant's armada.

The Qadesh is a vessel unique in the entire history of human space exploration, a true product of desperate times requiring an unconventional approach. During the Martian War, the Earth Federated Nations' military invaded the Outer Rim with full force and introduced an aggresive bombardment strategy commenced by both bomber raids and capital ships. The Syndicate turned out to be unprepared for EFN forces targeting planets and orbital installations on such a scale and the first weeks of fightings brought disastrous damage done to ORS industry and its production potential drastically diminished. In order to turn the tide ORS High Command introduced a plan to make the most vulnerable elements of industry independent from planets and their closest neighbourhood. With long and devastating warfare on Mars, the Outer Rim mobile shipyards and factories turned out to be the factor that led to the Syndicate's victory. 

The Qadesh is fully capable of producing ships up to frigate size and performing repairs of ships up to destroyer configuration even in combat conditions. It has an optimal crew of 2,000, but routine repairs can be performed with only 500 crewmembers. Only one mobile shipyard – the ORSh Big Buddha – survived the Shivan Invasion of Sol. From the outset of the Exodus from Sol it has always had the arduous job of repairing Syndicate warships damaged in engagements with the Shivans. There is a popular saying among the Big Buddha's engineers that 'if three days go by where we haven't had to repair a Roaming Fleet frigate, the Exodus Fleet is either safe or completely fucked.'"

The Guardian is a heavy defensive platform which mounts 2 railgun batteries and 8 light anti-fighter turrets. Guardians are a major supplement to Syndicate defenses; before the Exodus from Sol they were deployed around important ORS installations. Factory ships began to successfully produce Guardians during the Exodus, but due to cost and transport difficulties, they are used only during an emergency. Their standard role in the Exodus Fleet's defensive strategy is to support ORS heavy warships during jump node blockades."

5721, "EFD Talos"

5722, "Earth Federated Nations - Talos Destroyer

An advanced destroyer concept and one of the most high-tech vessels ever produced by mankind, the formidable Talos-class destroyer was introduced as a part of Admiral Donathan Walker's military reforms in 2361. The Federation designed this warship with a single purpose – to confront and eliminate Galahad-class destroyers. Still reliant on Praetor battlecarriers, the EFN fleet suffered from a lack of offensive potential, and while the Vidar-class frigates were always formidable opponents for the numerous Syndicate frigates, the Gaian Fleet lacked heavier units designed with versatility in mind. While physically smaller than the Galahad, the Talos has similar firepower. Though it is armed with a few plasma cannons, the main advantage of the Talos is its numerous torpedo clusters. This destroyer was designed to swarm its target with countless Scimitar torpedoes, effectively rendering the majority of the Galahads railgun batteries inoperable. 

The Talos is not only excellently armed, but like every large Federation warship, it has a large fighter and bomber complement. The Talos is equipped with three hangar bays containing a total complement of up to 180 fighters and bombers. Large squadrons of Cronus and Lyre bombers often support the Talos during strike operations, extending its already tremendous anti-warship offensive push. Talos destroyers use a form of improvised shock-jump tactics inspired by the Lucifer superdestroyer and swarm their targets with countless torpedo launches and bomber strikes. However, the Talos pays the price for this effectiveness with relatively light armor, high maintenance costs, and a constant need to resupply the destroyer with additional torpedoes. 

Talos-class vessels were never numerous. A lack of advanced command facilities and utility prevents the Talos from taking on a flagship role, leading to the Talos-class destroyers serving in strike elements. As a result, warships of this class were mostly commanded by commodores or rear-admirals. Notable examples of this class include the Iapetus, the Ascendant, the Augustus and the only one that survived the Shivan invasion – the EFD Redemption under the command of Rear Admiral Victor Leibniz. Restoring torpedo arsenals was the biggest problem that severely limited the Redemption's effectiveness against Shivan vessels and relegated the flagship of the EFN remnant to the role of assault carrier. Fortunately, by the time the Exodus Fleet left Cor Caroli, the Redemption was outfitted with an antimatter converter and automated torpedo assemblers."

6106, "Alright, you heard him. Spark, take Beta wing and find out what you can. If someone is still alive in there, we need to know about it. Alpha will tag along with the frigates and protect them from all the floating debris."

6107, "We're on it, boss. Beta, form up on me. Let's move in on the Damascus."

6108, "Scan complete. Just as I thought.... The Damascus' subspace transmitters have been completely smashed. However, I can now access their internal comm channels. It looks like they're trying to establish a connection as we speak. Patching them through."

6109, "Finally! Reinforcements came! I thought the Valhalla had already written us off. We've been dead in space ever since we assisted the Tiberius against that Shivan battlegroup. "

6110, "Damascus, this is Valhalla Command. We are glad to hear your voice again, Fleetmaster Arales. Before we lost contact, you reported being surrounded and badly outnumbered. What is your current status? "

6111, "I am transmitting all our diagnostics right now. Both our primary cores have been damaged. Radiation levels are above critical across three decks. A third of my crew is KIA and another third requires medical attention ASAP."

6112, "Diagnostics received, Damascus. Sit tight. We are dispatching a Corsair transport, designation Omega 1, with emergency repair teams right away. ETA, four minutes."

6113, "Fleetmaster, where are the others? Did a single ship from the 17th make it out? What happened to all the Federates? "

6114, "They're all gone, Harmattan. The EFCa Tiberius went down with all hands, along with its entire battle group. We're not that much better off ourselves, since we lost all our escort frigates. Only our heavy armor allowed us to survive the onslaught."

6115, "We made the bastards pay dearly for our losses, though. We took out three Shivan destroyers, including the Samael-class destroyer Sonneillon. Add a full detachment of frigates and cruisers onto that. We halted their offensive in this sector but only temporarily, I'm afraid."

6116, "The Tiberius is gone? Looks like Admiral Walker, the Lion of the Federation, finally met his end. That bastard's hunter-killer teams claimed far too many good men in the past few months."

6117, "The hunter became the hunted. That's at least some reassurance in all this insanity. I'm glad the Shivans did the job for us. "

6118, "Damn all of you for your short-sightedness! The Federates are no longer our enemies! They share our fight for survival now! I'd rather have Walker with us right now, holding back the invaders. "

6119, "And yet he ended up here, reduced to cosmic ash as he died fighting alongside the people he once hunted down. What twisted irony. "

6120, "All this death and destruction.... I just...can't stand it. See that charred wreckage over there? That's from the Gefjon. I knew a pilot who served on it, callsign 'Axe'. Now he's dead. Just like the rest of them...."

6121, "I'm sorry, Rosie. This isn't easy for any of us. "

6122, "Have faith, sister. They have found peace amongst the high heavens. In sha Allah."

6123, "This is insane. How can we talk so casually about the genocide around us? We tried to stop the Shivans but they just keep coming! When will this end?"

6124, "I know, Rosie. I'm just as horrified as you are. But right now, we have to trust Valhalla's judgment. Fleetmaster Glenzmann fought the Shivans before, just like Fleetmaster Caliphtys. They'll find a way."

6125, "And if they don't? We all know the stories from the Great War. We kept listening to them as kids. Monsters from the most terrifying of nightmares. I want to believe in our higher-ups at Valhalla Command, Spark, but how can they...how can anyone stop such an enemy?"

6126, "We cannot give up. That may not sound like much but it is just about all we can do for the moment...."

6127, "Omega 1 now on scene. We are carrying engineering teams for the Damascus. Pilots, cover us as we make our approach."

6128, "Acknowledged. Beta wing, form up on Omega 1. The fate of everyone onboard the Damascus now rests on that transport safely docking with her."

6129, "Hostiles in the area! Shivan fighters at three clicks out! Take them down!"

6130, "Allah has smiled upon us today. All hostiles have been neutralized. "

6131, "This is Omega 1. Docking point is secure. Our engineering teams are now boarding the Damascus. Beta, good job saving our asses from those Shivans."

6132, "Wait, what's that? Multiple jump signatures five clicks from our position: one frigate and three fighters. All have Earther IFFs."

6133, "Alright, people, we might have bad guys joining the party. Let's hope we haven't bumped into a Federate version of Nielsen or something like that."

6134, "Hey! I heard that!"

6135, "Syndicate vessels, this is Captain Iris Nithercott of the EFFg Andrasta. We barely escaped the Shivan offensive, but enemy bombers have tracked us and will not be far behind! We need immediate fighter support!!"

6136, " Andrasta, this is Shipmaster Le Brunon, ORFg Harmattan. Head towards the Damascus and help us get it to safety. Beta wing, detach from our defensive screen and protect the Andrasta until it can join us."

6137, "Damn Federates. We almost lost the Damascus trying to save their hides. Now they dare to ask for even more of our help?"

6138, "I'm warning you for the last time, Nielsen. Say another word and I'll walk over, drag you from your cockpit and strike that empty head of yours so hard your beloved Earth's gonna have a shiny new crater!"

6139, "They found us! A full wing of Shivan bombers with heavy escort in pursuit! Clear them out before they get too close! "

6140, "Another wave of bombers inbound! Hurry, stop them before their warheads impact the Andrasta!"

6141, "That's all of them. Area's clear. Rearm if you need to, pilots. "

6142, "Not bad shooting...for you outsiders, at least. Stay vigilant. The Shivans might launch another attack any minute now and I don't want Earth's soldiers dying in vain because of your clumsiness."

6143, "Watch your mouth, Earther. We're not helping you just to listen to your insults."

6144, "Spark, keep it calm, ok? We're on the same side now, Sword 1. Let's not start our new alliance with unnecessary insults."

6145, "Cooperation does not imply friendship, Alpha 1. But since it serves both our interests for the moment, let us pretend to be friends for a while. That should indeed increase our chances for survival. Lieutenant Commander Ian MacNeacail, 141st Silver Shrikes, Earth Defense Force, Iron Ring 09. "

6146, "Squadmaster Harper, 49th Avalonians, ORD Thor. Huh...either my memory's playing tricks on me or I recognize that shining shield insignia on your hull. We've met before, Commander. Or 'clashed' would be a better word. "

6147, "Charon Passage, four weeks ago. You attacked our supply convoys alongside one of Walker's hunter-killer teams. I chalked up two of your wingmen and nearly blasted your chivalric ass into space."

6148, "Ghost and Templar died in that mission. Good soldiers. I mourned their sacrifice, but it allowed us to vaporize five of your supply ships. A wonderful memory indeed, Squadmaster. I am somewhat disappointed we will not have an opportunity to finish our little...duel. "

6149, "For my part, I'd really love to finish our duel, Commander, but my kill list's grown quite long since the invasion began. Long and full of buggies. It'll be temporarily deprived of any Federates."

6150, "Oh well. I suppose that's some form of relief."

6151, "It appears you're handling pretty well if you can keep your emotions in check, Captain. Bit of a rare surprise, considering all the death and destruction around us. "

6152, "Typical Earther. Hunting rebels and terrorists probably made death your daily bread. Am I right, Captain? "

6153, "In actual fact, it was harsh lessons from my father$semicolon a Great War veteran who participated in the attack on the Lucifer. He saw this horror with his own eyes... the knowledge that they would return one day pre-determined his remaining life... and therefore, my life too. "

6154, "Seems like a fairy-tale for kids. But if it helps in overcoming your fears, it's worth spreading. As for the second part, it's hard to disagree. It's the same proverb that I had in mind for Charon Passage."

6155, "I knew I recognized the last name! Your father is Alistair MacNeacail, the last living Terran to have crossed the Delta Serpentis node. It's an honour, Captain. "

6156, "I lived my whole live trying to follow in his footsteps and uphold the legend. Not an easy task, believe me. "

6157, "Attention all Syndicate and Federate forces! We are sending you coordinates for a rendezvous point near the Valhalla's zone of control. Prepare to depart without delay. Leave anything that cannot be evacuated right now. "

6158, "Valhalla, tell me that was just an outburst of garbled static. You are not asking us to..."

6159, "...abandon Earth? We are, Fleetmaster Arales. The Sathanas armada is on the move and will reach Earth much sooner than we anticipated. The first juggernauts will arrive within three to four minutes. Their vanguard will be upon you in approximately sixty seconds. "

6160, "Leave Earth? Impossible! You outsiders were supposed to help us hold the Shivans here! Now we're to abandon everyone still trapped on Earth?!"

6161, "We can still delay the juggernauts despite our present condition, Valhalla! We can buy additional time for the evacuating refugee convoys! We cannot just--"

6162, "You CAN and you WILL, Fleetmaster! That is a direct order. Let us call it...a revision of strategy. Earth is lost, as is anyone who doesn't make it out before the armada surrounds the planet."

6163, "We are awaiting the Damascus at the rendezvous point, Fleetmaster. You'll be informed of any additional Shivan activity in the area. Godspeed. You are going to need it. "

6164, "Future generations will judge you for that, Valhalla. They will judge all of us. I just hope that one day they will understand the reasons behind our actions."

6165, " Engines and primary turrets are back online. Our subspace drive is still heavily damaged and powered by secondary reactors only. However, our chief engineer estimates this should be sufficient enough for us to jump out. All ships, form up and cover our retreat."

6166, "Everyone, listen up! Earthers, stay by the Andrasta and cover the Damascus' jump drive from surprise attacks. Alpha and Beta, we're on forward intercept. Destroy any bombers they throw against our warships. Is that clear?"

6167, "Couldn't be any clearer, squadmaster. We'll get the Damascus to safety, no matter what it takes."

6168, "Sword wing, our charge is the Andrasta and the Damascus' flank! We will annihilate everything that stands between us and the rendezvous. We will survive! And when the time comes, we will avenge Earth. For all the innocents we're leaving behind!"

6169, "Damascus, be advised. The first juggernaut has just arrived near your location. Designation SJ Ribesal."

6170, "The Sathanas.... Oh my God, it's far more terrifying in person than in the vidclips!"

6171, "Six clicks in length and firepower far exceeding any Terran warship. How could we even hope to challenge such a monster?"

6172, "We can't. Perhaps we're not even gonna have to...not today at least. It's too far from us to be a threat, so just concentrate on what's in front of us. We'll make it!"

6173, "The second Sathanas juggernaut is here! Designation SJ Vucub Caquix. It's also out of range of us and holding position."

6174, "We are detecting a growing energy signature from the beam cannons of both juggernauts. Estimated time until they are fully charged...twenty minutes."

6175, "Wait... We're not the target! Those juggernauts...they're getting ready to fire on Earth itself!"

6176, "This isn't happening! Tell me this isn't happening!"

6177, "Stay with me, Rosie! We'll get through this, I promise! "

6178, "All ships, spread out and prepare for departure. I don't want any heroics here! If a juggernaut catches us, this will be our only chance to get away!"

6179, "Incoming Shivan jump signatures! Two wings of Nephilim bombers with two wings of Scorpions on flanking maneuvers!"

6180, "You know the drill, Alpha and Beta! Bombers first, then the Scorpions! Sword, keep that flank covered! "

6181, "Soldiers of Earth, let our enemies feel our wrath! Terra Ad Infinitum! "

6182, "Three juggernauts have assumed position over Earth! The Mephistophiles is now charging its beam cannons as well!"

6183, "Shivan cruisers Ahriman and Forneus are jumping into our escape corridor! Escort frigates, lock targets and open fire! We need to clear a path for the Damascus!"

6184, "Escort fighters, a wing of Seraphim bombers has jumped in. Wipe them out but watch out for their turrets. Don't let them get through."

6185, "The Damascus will be ready to jump in approximately three minutes. Keep it up, pilots!"

6186, "Jump drives at 80 percent charge! Estimated time of departure: two minutes!"

6187, " One minute until departure! We're in the home stretch now!"

6188, "Thirty seconds and counting! Hold steady, everyone! We're almost there! "

6189, "New contact! A fourth juggernaut, designation SJ Tyrant...and it's coming right at us! Damascus, we need to jump before it's too late!"

6190, " It's now or never! Trajectory for Valhalla Station locked in! Commencing jump sequence...now!"

6191, "We did it! We actually did it! "

6192, "What the hell--"

6193, "That pulse took out half of my systems-- "

6194, "Jump drive malfunction! We're dead in space-"

6195, "My engines are down! I can't get my systems back online!"

6196, "Hold on, Rosie! Please hold on..."

6197, "Oh no! Spark! "

6198, "ROSIE!"

6199, "What the hell just happened? We were right on the verge of getting the Damascus to safety! Fleetmaster Arales, please come in! We're about to find ourselves within the Tyrant's firing range! "

6200, "We just suffered a catastrophic malfunction in the Damascus' photon-wave disruption chamber and it generated an EMP burst that disabled both the Damascus and our fighter escorts. Our jump drive is down and we can't maneuver. The fighters can recover from that EMP, but the Damascus isn't going anywhere."

6201, "Gunnery control, target the beam cannons of the Tyrant. I want you launching every single warhead we have left in our reserves! We need to--"

6202, "You're going against that juggernaut with frigates!? Even you can't be that foolish, Le Brunon! All units, you are to abandon the Damascus and withdraw to the rendezvous point!"

6203, "But Fleetmaster--"

6204, "THAT'S AN ORDER, LE BRUNON!"

6205, "Depart and live to fight another day. Tell both the Syndicate and the Federates of our combined stand here. Make it an example for others to follow. We swore to take Earth from the Federates. Now we shall die defending Earth from the Shivans."

6206, "Gunnery control, divert our power reserves to all gun batteries still in operation. Load the remaining torpedoes into their tubes and unleash them all against the Tyrant! For the Syndicate! For Europa!"

6207, "All wings, jump to the rendezvous point! If anyone suggests that we die like heroes today, I'm going to strangle them with my bare hands! "

6208, "Press C, then 4 and"

6209, "select a checkpoint. "

6210, "Checkpoint 1 reached"

6211, "Checkpoint 1 activated"

6212, "The Shivan cruisers are history! Good work, everyone. "

6213, "Those Shivan capital ships won't trouble us anymore. Well done."

6214, " All fighters, we have hull breaches on decks eight through ten! You need to concentrate on defending us!"

6215, "Fleetmaster Arales here. The Damascus is barely holding together. If we don't get more fighter cover now, we're never going to make it to Valhalla Station!"

6216, "Dioscuri to escort fighters! Hull damage is critical! We won't last much longer if you don't do something about those Shivans!"

6217, "This is the Harmattan. We have suffered moderate damage. Fighters, tighten your cover before our condition deteriorates further."

6218, "Le Brunon here. The Harmattan cannot take any further punishment! Give us additional support or we're finished! "

6219, "Mission failed

Damascus has been destroyed"

6220, "Mayday! Mayday! Omoikane Station calling all Terran ships within range! We're under attack by Shivan warships! Our civilian personnel is still being evacuated! Please assist us! "

6221, "Freighters V-87, V-88 and V-92 have jumped to safety."

6222, "Another convoy is in the clear, but we're being hit hard by Shivan bombers. "

6223, "We're doing all we can, Paris Control, but we're pinned down over here. We do not have reinforcements available for you at this time."

6224, "Then we'll have to stagger what we send into orbit until support arrives. Godspeed, Tiberius. Paris Control, out. "

6225, "Damascus battlegroup, you have your orders. Keep the Shivans away from Earth as long as you can! Reinforce the Federates and buy them time to evacuate. For the Syndicate! Ad Astra per Aspera!"

6226, "All fighters, form up and follow me! Clear a path for the bombers!"

6227, "Gunnery control, give me suppressing fire on those cruisers! I want a clear path to the Tiberius this very instant!"

6228, "SD Sonneillon and SD Lagash are inbound! I don't know how long we can hold them back, Damascus! "

6229, "Sustaining heavy damage! Hull failure imminent! We're going down--"

6230, "Helm, ahead full! Gunnery control, maximum firepower! We will hold the line, no matter the cost!"

6231, "Enemy frigates are inbound. Stay on course, Harmattan. We'll deal with them ourselves."

6232, "Autopilot offline"

6233, "Engines offline

6238, "All units, disregard the Omoikane's transmission and focus on your primary objective. There is nothing we can do for any of them."

6239, "We are detecting Shivan warships warping in at long range. They are targeting the remaining orbital installations. They're too far away to help. Hopefully, the Federates have already finished evacuating them."

6240, "--repeat, can anyone hear m-- --still 2,000 civilians onboard--"

6246, "Damascus, contact reports of additional juggernauts are flooding in. At this rate, the entire planet will be completely surrounded in a matter of minutes. Escape from Earth while you still can."

6545, "Welcome to $G Valhalla $G Station, the military headquarters of the $G Outer $G Rim $G Syndicate. I am $B Tactical $B Arbiter $B James $B Wallace. I'll be briefing you while your fighters are undergoing repair. 

I will not waste your time on formalities. All of you were there when it happened. You saw it with your own eyes. 

$B Earth, the $G EFN's capital world and humanity's ancestral home, has fallen to the $R Shivans."

6546, "The Shivan juggernaut fleet bombarded the entire planet from orbit. This is a terrible blow for the entire human race. We only have preliminary estimates on the number of casualties but it is clear they toll in the high billions. Elements of the 4th Uranian and 5th Neptunian Fleets were deployed to support the $G EFN's final stand at $b Earth. When the $R Shivan $R juggernauts showed up earlier than expected, however, $G Valhalla $G Command decided to withdraw our forces."

6547, "Meanwhile, what's left of our own fleets is struggling to defend $B Europa, $B Io, $B Ganymede and other $G Outer $G Rim colonies. With the majority of the $R Shivan $R fleet still committed to bombarding $b Earth and fighting the $G EFN, the $G ORS is intensifying efforts to evacuate the civilian population of the Outer Rim. We managed to destroy the $R Shivan battlegroup which attacked our own capital world of $B Europa. However, we cannot hope to hold our ground indefinitely. The $R Sathanas armada will come for us when it is finished with $B Earth so we must move quickly in order to save as many of our people as possible."

6548, "Regrettably, we must inform you that the $G ORD $G Thor, the ORS flagship under the command of High Fleetmaster Christian Glenzmann, was destroyed during the defense of $B Europa. The $G Thor was instrumental in our victory at Europa, but in the end, the $G Thor was brought down by a massive wave of $R Shivan reinforcements warships/bombers/something else. Christian Glenzmann died a hero of the $G Syndicate. He fought right until the bitter end to drive the $R Shivans away from our worlds. For that, he will be remembered. 

Fleetmaster Caliphtys of the $G ORD $G Demetrius is now acting commander of the $G ORS fleet until a new High Fleetmaster can be selected by the Magistrates."

6549, "Because of our pending evacuation, most of $G Valhalla $G Station's stockpiles are being prepared for transportation. You'll have to go into combat with what limited resources we immediately have available to us.

$G Valhalla $G Station has access to the $G Syndicate military's standard fighter classes. The $y ORF $y Claymore is the fastest and most agile interceptor in the ORS arsenal. While ideal for escort duties, its agility is offset by a single secondary bank. The $y ORF $y Defender, on the other hand, is a versatile space superiority platform that was derived from the $y GTF $y Ulysses, a $B Great $B War era design. Between its primary hardpoints and secondary storage capacities, the Defender's firepower is highly recommended."

6550, "YYou have also been granted access to the standard armaments your squadron utilized during the attempted rescue of the $G Damascus. 

Our fighters are typically equipped with the $y Prometheus $y N cannon. This is a multi-purpose assault weapon that has a reputation of being somewhat mediocre. Bolster its effectiveness with the $y Pulsar $y PC-9 auxiliary ion cannon. The $y PC-9 is designed to rapidly overload enemy shields and neutralize subsystems. 

As for secondaries, you have the $y Stinger aspect-lock missile and the $y MX-112 medium-range swarm missile. Put them both to good use."

6551, "Last but not least, let me remind you that $G Valhalla $G Station has several squadrons of upgraded $y Centaur-class support ships at our disposal similar to the Centaurs deployed onboard the $G Damascus. Next-generation ammunition transfer modules allow your fighters to be rapidly resupplied in combat conditions. Additionally, the upgraded Centaurs can deploy a contingent of nanotech-drones that will repair your fighter's hull integrity up to 60 percent during standard docking procedures. 

Keep this in mind and do not hesitate to call upon them for rearm or repairs, especially when you might encounter a brief lull in combat."

6552, "Welcome to $G Valhalla $G Station, pilots. I'm $B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Pavlus $B Hemming. I know you've been waiting for orders and I apologize for the delay. Repairs on your fighters are almost complete. That's the good news. The bad news is that Mars has just been obliterated by the $R Sathanas $R fleet. What's left of both the $G EFN and $G ORS fleets are spread thin throughout the Sol system, so it's only a matter of time before the Shivans return and turn their full attention to $G Valhalla $G Station."

6553, "$B Europa will soon come under orbital bombardment a second time and $G Valhalla $G Station is already under siege. $G ORS $G High $G Command has already evacuated aboard the $G ORD $G Demetrius.  However, most of $G Valhalla $G Station's personnel are still here coordinating the evacuation of civilians from $b Europa and have yet to leave. Our primary objective is to complete the evacuation from $G Valhalla $G Station before we're overrun."

6554, "Valhalla Station"

6555, "We are preparing four transport ships for launch. They are charged with ferrying away as many station crewmembers as they can carry. Your first objective is to clear a path by eliminating all $R Shivan forces attacking the station. When $G Lambda wing's transports leave the hangar bay, you will provide escort until they jump to a safer location."

6556, "Transport ships"

6557, "The $G Ida $G Lewis, a large $y Hephaestus-class mining vessel, is currently docked with $G Valhalla $G Station. It is also being prepared for departure as we speak and will be carrying everything we cannot afford to leave behind. It is of the highest priority that the $G Ida $G Lewis leaves the field of engagement intact. You have pending orders to protect it once it is ready to proceed."

6558, "Ida Lewis"

6559, "At this time, $G Valhalla $G Station is currently being defended by the $G ORFg $G Harmattan and the $G ORFg $G Dioscuri, the two frigates which escaped from $b Earth alongside you. They will provide the firepower necessary to eliminate $R Shivan warships, but you must defend them against incoming bomber strikes. The $G ORFg $G Damocles, a $y Tychicus-class heavy frigate, is also inbound to support us and should arriving within a few minutes."

6560, "Damocles"

6561, "That's all, pilots. Your fighters should be ready for launch now. I wish you luck out there. We could certainly use a lot of it right about now. "

6562, "Tactical Arbiter Hemming:
Welcome to the Ida Lewis, pilots. Your performance out there was spectacular. We were able to evacuate all remaining personnel and left very little, if anything, behind for the Shivans. A job well done, indeed.

The Ida Lewis is currently outbound towards a rendezvous point near Charon, where we aim to regroup before planning further action against the Shivans. The latest reports show the fleet, already exhausted and low on morale, has been heavily decimated. As grim as that might sound, ORS forces still remain in a fair state of combat readiness.

Unfortunately, those reports also indicated that only a handful of Federates managed to escape Earth. Their forces are currently in no condition for further combat. Therefore, the responsibility of continuing humanity's resistance against the Shivans falls to our own fleet. 

We recovered enough supplies for the Ida Lewis' technicians to get your fighters ready for your next sortie. I am sure you will be needed again soon. For now, we've prepared quarters for you so you can get some rest. You might not get another chance for a while. Dismissed."

6563, "The evacuation of Valhalla Station did not go as planned. ORS forces encountered strong Shivan resistance and were unable to accomplish our goals here."

6564, "The Lambda transports assigned to evacuate Valhalla Station were attacked by Shivan forces. Despite your valiant effort to defend them, the transports took heavy losses and most of the Valhalla Station crewmembers never made it out."

6565, "Our frigates assigned to keep the Shivans away from Valhalla Station were unable to hold the line against the combined force of enemy warships and bomber wings. Without their firepower we were unable to complete the evacuation."

6566, "The Ida Lewis, the factory ship that was meant to evacuate the remaining personnel of Valhalla Station, has been destroyed. You failed to hold off the Shivans and help the Ida Lewis escape."

At this time, we have very few assets that can be spared for emergency deployments. Make the most of what you have and try to keep our ships as intact as possible.

6697, "We completed the City of the Sun's evacuation as best we could. Over 250,000 civilians were retrieved by the Abraham. In its care, they will receive proper treatment and accommodation. Combined with those who already left the station via transports, we estimate that nearly one third of the city's total population made it to safety. 

I am sharing with you these statistics so as to relieve you of any sense that your efforts might've been in vain. I realize it was a difficult decision for you to open fire on civilians. It is against our principles and I wish we didn't have to do it. But if the Abraham had accepted even more refugees, then the ship's overpopulation would have eventually led to the worst possible outcomes: rioting, pandemics, food shortages...even rebellion. We would have lost more people than we would have saved if you hadn't opened fire. In the end, that decision was ultimately the necessary one. 

This war is far from over. What we are struggling for is the very survival of our race. We will not be able to save everyone that needs our help. Given our situation, I also cannot guarantee that we will not again be forced into drastic measures like the ones we took today. From now on, you will need to be prepared for such a possibility, pilots.
"

6698, "The City of the Sun's evacuation ended in complete disaster. Abraham, our grand ark, floating city and agricultural centre, was overwhelmed and destroyed by the Shivans. We overestimated our own strength and allowed the colony ship to await refugees from the city for too long. Although we knew there was still vast numbers of people awaiting evac, we should have known how many we could save without putting the rest at risk. The destruction of the Abraham is a terrible blow for our evacuation efforts. We cannot afford the same recklessness again.  "

6699, "The forces we tasked with the City of the Sun's evacuation encountered heavy Shivan resistance. As a result of the fighting there, the frigate Bauhaus was destroyed. This left the Abraham vulnerable to enemy attacks. It quickly became impossible for our forces to hold off the Shivans and accomplish our goals. Thus, we had to completely withdraw from the area or risk further casualties. There is no telling how many people we left behind to be slaughtered by the Shivans."

6700, "The evacuation of the City of the Sun did not go as planned. Despite intially having the area well secured, our forces become involved in heavy engagements with the Shivans. We took severe losses from the civilian shuttles fleeing the stations, leaving only a small handful as having made it to the Abraham. We are unable to measure the loss of life that resulted from the fighting that took place. However, it presents a bleak picture for what remains of our people. "

6701, "Desperate times require desperate measures. You were directly ordered to prevent the civilian shuttles from landing on the Abraham by any means necessary. It might have been against our principles and it was a task that required strong willpower. I will grant you that. However, this act of mercy may soon result in far greater casualties in the long run. The Abraham's population will now have to face down the consequences of overcrowding, starvation and breakouts of violence. This will only make things increasingly difficult as we struggle to save the human race."

6702, "This mission ended in complete disaster. The City of the Sun was destroyed by the Shivan invaders before the Abraham could finishing boarding refugees. We were counting on you to hold off the enemy long enough until it had reached capacity. The assets we had available on site should've been enough to accomplish the mission. As it is, we cannot even begin to fathom the loss of life that has just transpired. A failure as great as this does not bode well for the rest of us."

6703, "By the way, the crew of the Al-Quam sends you their warmest thanks. You did well in saving that frigate from destruction. The losses the Shivans have inflicted are already immeasurable. The more fleet assets we save now, the better our odds of survival will be."

6704, "Regretfully, the Abraham's attending frigates were all lost during the evacuation. The last of them, the ORFg Al-Qaum, which held the perimeter until your arrival, was destroyed by overwhelming Shivan forces. We will now have to handle the Abraham's defense with the limited assets we have left."

6798, "The Callicantzaros has been destroyed. We are now moving to counter those cruisers. Pilots, clear those hostile fighters for us."

6799, "Abraham, please be advised. We are re-opening our hangar bays. Civilian vessels will be leaving the domes and heading your way shortly. Prepare to receive shuttles."

6800, "We are go for receiving shuttles. However, please note that the Abraham has already taken on 160 percent of its initially planned capacity. The more we accept now, the less space we have remaining for the hydroponics bays."

6801, "The refugees can be relocated later, Abraham. I still have 500,000 people awaiting evac. My priority is to send off as many as I can in the time we have remaining. City of the Sun, out."

6802, "They will never manage to evacuate them all. If this operation takes too long, then those already onboard the colony ship could be put in serious jeopardy. "

6807, "This is the Abraham. We are confirming the arrival of the first group of civilians."

6808, "Good work, pilots. We are preparing to launch two more groups. Fall back to the station and be ready to form up on the shuttles."

6809, "Shivan cruisers inside the perimeter. We will deal with them. Alpha, we need you to join us and eliminate their fighter escorts. Beta, keep protecting the civilians. "

6810, "The second group of civilians are safely aboard, City Control. However, we barely have enough room to house them all. We only have room for one more group."

6811, "I understand, Abraham. We are finalizing the last group's launch. I must warn you of our ground situation. Heavy rioting is starting to erupt around the domes. Our marines are barely keeping order within the shuttle docks. "

6812, "The last group of civilians is launching from dome three now. Escort fighters, their lives are in your hands."

6813, "Copy that, City Control. We will be waiting for them. "

6814, "The last group has been safely retrieved. We are now at full capacity and preparing for departure. We need several minutes to get underway and clear the area."

6815, " Oh, shit...did you see that!? There was a massive explosion inside the City's central section!"

6816, "City of the Sun, come in! What the hell just happened out there?"

6817, "Abraham, there was an explosion inside the station's primary reactor. Main power throughout the entire city is down! We are switching over to auxiliary power now."

6818, "Look! All the hangar bay doors have opened! Any shuttles still in the domes can now leave unhindered!"

6819, "It looks like the situation was grim enough to push someone into a desperate act...."

6820, "Abraham, someone has overridden our control systems and locked all the hangar doors into their open positions! We cannot prevent any of the remaining shuttles from launching!"

6821, "Civilian shuttles, please stand down. The colony ship is overloaded and cannot support taking on additional passengers. Turn away before you force us to fire upon your craft. "

6822, "Abraham, listen to me! You can't just leave us here to die! My son gave his life for the Syndicate. You can't honestly intend to-- "

6823, "Civilian shuttles, I repeat! We are not able to take anyone else onboard! This is your final warning. Turn back now or we will open fire!"

6824, "You leave us no choice. Escort fighters, weapons free! Destroy the shuttles at once!"

6825, "What?! Squadmaster, there must be another way! We can't just--"

6826, "Do it, Spark! All fighters, fire on the shuttles! Don't let any of them land inside the Abraham!"

6827, "One of the shuttles managed to enter the Abraham. Pilots, prioritize the rest! They have to be destroyed! "

6828, "We...we did it. All the remaining shuttles are gone."

6829, " We've accomplished our mission objectives here, Alpha. We are now ready to depart. Setting course for our designated rendezvous point. Take up escort positions around us while we await mission update."

6830, "Attention, all ORS forces! The Sathanas juggernauts are moving upon Saturn and Jupiter. Four are heading for Europa and Io, two for Calypso and one for Titan. Do NOT engage them. Engage your jump drives and fall back to the rendezvous point! That's an order!"

6831, "Critical hit! Clear-- --oing dow--"

6832, "The Abraham is under heavy fire! You need to stop the Shivans before they inflict any further damage!"

6833, "The City of the Sun is under attack! We can't repel the Shivans by ourselves! Please, help us!"

6835, "Al-Qaum here. Our hull integrity is critical. If we don't make it...ensure that our sacrifice today will mean something."

6836, "We're losing too many civilian shuttles out here! Keep those Shivans away from them!"

6838, "We lost a transport! Take out those fuckin' Dragons already! We gotta keep the way clear for the civilians!"

6851, "We had to do it...right? I mean, was there really no other option? The Abraham couldn't have accepted just a few more passengers?"

6854, "Yeah...you're right, kid. I'm sorry. That's...that's just about the best thing we can do for ourselves in this situation. Abraham, do you have a status update for us?"

6855, "Syndicate fighters, don't shoot! I'm begging you! Don't do it! "

6856, "Please, Abraham! Just let my daughter on board! She's only eight. She doesn't deserve to die here!"

6857, "Full radio jamming across all public channels is in effect. Alpha and Beta, you have your orders. Carry them out!"

6858, "But then, what happens next? I mean, where are we going to keep all those refugees?"

6859, "The further we can keep them from the Shivans, the better. I hope someone up high is putting together a plan with that in mind."

6860, "This is the Al-Qaum. We have finished repairing some of our battle damage. Hopefully, that will keep us in the fight a little while longer as we continue evacuating the City."

6861, "The Al-Qaum is down! Pilots, the Syndicate is counting on us to protect the Abraham and all those civilians. We must not fail them here!"

6862, "That's our cue to leave, people! Abraham, jump now. We will follow you to the rendezvous point."

Welcome back, pilots. I am glad to inform you that both the $G Abraham and the $G Ida $G Lewis are now safe at one of our rallying points. Our forces were able to outmaneuver the $R Shivans which pursued us after our last mission. We should therefore have a brief moment of respite on our hands. However, we do not have the luxury of wasting time as other important objectives currently await our attention."

6869, "The latest situational reports from the frontline front line are not good. The $R Sathanas armada arrived at $B Jupiter and $B Saturn, sowing widespread destruction in its wake. The juggernaut $R Tyrant is leading an offensive against $B Europa with heavy escort in tow. The $G 2nd $G Jovian $G Fleet received orders to hold the line by any means necessary and cover the remaining $B Europans. Regrettably, they were eventually cornered and suffered serious losses. 

The remnants are trying to slow down the $R Shivans through a series of hit-and-run attacks, but they are unable to break through the $R Tyrant's defensive screen. It is now bombarding $B Europa with concentrated beam fire, turning huge volumes of water into steam clouds and causing massive tsunami waves to hit our main cities. 

The apocalypse has finally reached our capital world. "

Convoys were being sent away up until the very moment the $R Tyrant arrived. The $G ORCa $G Graf $G Zeppelin's commanding officer, the man in charge of the evacuation, made a difficult decision to  have the entire convoy crash-jump in range of $B Europa's gravitational field. At this time, the fate of those ships is unknown.  We tried tracking them through subspace but all we know for sure is that they emerged somewhere near $B Uranus."

6874, "Refugee convoys"

6875, "Unfortunately, the $R Shivans established a supply cache in that sector. They have plenty of cargo containers and supply vessels there from which to sustain their offensive against our worlds. Making matters worse, they have deployed strange communication node devices. These devices are interfering with our long-range scanners and our comm channels. 


As long as those comm nodes remain operational, we are won't be able to locate our missing convoys or coordinate any of our activities in and around $B Uranus. Previous attempts to destroy these comm nodes were driven off, but with the $R Shivans having redeployed their defenders to attack our core worlds, we now have an opportunity to attack both the comm nodes and the supply depot."

In doing so, we kill two birds with one stone: locating the missing $B Europan refugees and dividing the attention of any $R Shivans attacking the core worlds. Because our fighting capabilities are now very limited, brute force will not help us against our enemies. Instead, we will have to do things the hard way and outsmart them."

6884, "$G Beta, you will be launched as both a reconnaissance force and a vanguard for our attack. We are striking the most isolated node in their network, which is reportedly still damaged after our previous attempts. Wipe out the node's defenders and force the $R Shivans to stretch out their forces. Engage these targets at your discretion. $G Alpha will then be immediately deployed to lead the main assault from the other side."

6885, "From this point onward, it is up to your squadmasters to select an optimal assault strategy. Your primary targets are the communications nodes. Our mission will not be successful unless we blow up all three of them. Secondary targets include $R Shivan freighters and cargo depots, but beware of escort fighters and sentry guns. The freighters are likely to try to making a run for it once they come under attack, so move quickly if you plan to neutralize them. Finally, we are almost certainly counting on the enemy to dispatch further reinforcements if they wish to uphold their supremacy in this sector. "

6886, "We are preparing further assets to reinforce you throughout the mission. $G Delta wing's strike bombers will soon be ready to deploy in the event that $R Shivan warships show up. We've also received a message that a small $G Federate taskforce from $B Earth, under $G Rear $G Admiral $G Victor $G Leibniz, has volunteered to support our operation.

6992, "Alpha wing has arrived. Alright, kiddies, the bugs are right there, fresh and waiting to be toasted! Let's roll! "

6993, "Alpha lead, you are now assuming tactical command over this operation. Remember, destroy the communication devices and inflict maximum damage to... "

6994, "vaporize the crap out of every single bandit in the area. I got it, Command. Count on us to get it done."

6995, "Alpha lead, be advised. The EFN's Sword wing is currently inbound to your location. They will be joining the assault in less than 60 seconds. "

6996, "Great. So we're working with the Federates again. As if that cursed assignment at Earth wasn't bad enough... "

6997, "Durga and Rama wings are down. We're secure on this side, boss."

6998, "Alright, kid. Engage enemy targets as you seek fit. Blow up that supply depot! Let's make as much of a mess as we can before more of the bugs start showing up."

6999, "Damn! These comm nodes are tough. Command probably 'forgot' to mention that to us. Or maybe it was 'need-to-know'..."

7003, "Your mistrust is unfounded, Alpha lead. You came to our aid back at Earth. Now, we shall repay our debts. We are moving to assist Beta wing as ordered. "

7004, "Those freighters are starting to clear out! Beta, if you aren't occupied, you might want to hurry up and finish them off! "

7005, "And there goes the big one! That's a few extra tons of war supplies that won't be getting used against us! "

7006, "That's it! All remaining Shivan freighters have been destroyed! "

7007, "We smashed the entire cargo depot. That should hurt the Shivans severely. "

7008, "All fighters, be advised. You have multiple Shivan warships warping in around the remaining comm nodes. "

7009, "Shit! Split up, split up! Evasive actions! "

7010, "We'll never take them out by ourselves! Their anti-fighter guns will splash us long before we inflict can any meaningful damage!"

7011, "Command, do you copy? We're being suppressed by those warships and cannot proceed with the mission! Where the hell is our bomber support!? "

7012, "Pilots, maintain a safe distance from those warships and await reinforcements. Delta bombers are already en route. However, we're also sending you something far better. Please stand by. "

7013, "Woah! We've got a pretty big one here. It's a Dis-class freighter, the SFr Qemuel. It almost looks like a tiny Sathanas. "

7014, "That Rahu is pulling away to minimize any collateral damage to the rest of the depot. Pretty clever for a Shivan. Let's not give him that opportunity. Take it out now, Beta! "

7015, "It would look a lot nicer in a few dozen pieces. We should neutralize that thing before it makes off with any cargo."

7016, "Better than bombers, huh? Those useless morons better send us something with a lot of firepower. Otherwise, this assault is gonna end up being rather short. "

7017, "Listen up, pilots. Delta wing's strike bombers are ready for deployment. Call them in at your discretion. They will arrive near your position. "

7018, "We're not gonna be able to cover the bombers and that old fossil if we're bunched up. Time for us to divide and conquer. Alpha, head for the Akka! We'll escort that frigate on her way in."

7019, "Spark, you're taking over the assault. Engage the Shivans and call in Delta wing once their path is clear. If you order them to soften up those warships, the Akka will have an easier time finishing them off."

7020, "That didn't go too well. Most of the Shivan freighters managed to depart in one piece. "

7021, "I'm reading three more Mephisto freighters in the area. Designation Yama. Seems like they're trying to grab the remaining cargo units and haul them out of here."

7022, "The Qemuel is going down. That's the way it's done. "

7023, "The Qemuel has jumped out. At least we deprived it of its cargo container."

7024, "The Qemuel has departed and taken its cargo with it. We should've acted sooner on that one. "

7025, "The Nippur is history. "

7026, "Spark, those freighters from Soma wing are on the move. We should wipe them out quickly before they think twice about sticking around."

7027, "Watch out for Bhaga freighters. They are carrying cargo and trying to vacate the area! "

7028, "We have annihilated the Tabaet. "

7029, "I have confirmation that our long-range scanners are back online. We've already begun searching for our missing convoys. Well done, Akka. You're authorized to withdraw. Delta, Sword, follow them out and rendezvous with the Demetrius' battle group."

7030, "Command, this is Beta 1. All the comm nodes in this sector are out of action."

7031, "A job well done, Beta. We're now scanning the area around Uranus. In the meantime, continue with your attack and wipe out any remaining targets. "

7032, "Pilots, we've sustained moderate damage. However, we are still able to continue our mission. The Captain is asking you to bump your efforts up a notch."

7034, "Voices from the Mist"

7035, "Tactical Arbiter Hemming:
Good job destroying those devices, pilots. Thanks to your efforts, our scanners are fully functional in the vicinity around Uranus once again. We were able to track our missing convoy and confirm that its crash-jump from Europa took it all the way to Uranus. Beyond that, we are uncertain about how many ships may have survived entry into the planet's atmosphere. 

You are going to start your search at the exact destination point of their crash-jump. Be advised that we are not receiving any distress signals from the convoy. We suspect their emergency transponders were deactivated in order to reduce the likelihood of being discovered. However, the Shivans have sufficient forces to scour the entirety of the vicinity near Uranus. We do not. Therefore, it is imperative that we find the convoy before the Shivans do. 

Your primary objective is to locate and secure the ORSh Big Buddha, a mobile shipyard the ORS previously used during the Rim Conflict to repair its damaged warships, and the ORCa Graf Zeppelin, a Syr Darya-class carrier that was escorting the convoy. Because of their strategic value, it is essential you locate and rescue both the Big Buddha and the Graf Zeppelin and bring them both to the rendezvous point intact."

7036, "Shipmaster Donnelly:
Welcome aboard the Graf Zeppelin, pilots. I am Shipmaster Donnelly. I wanted to personally welcome the ORS pilots who braved Uranus' atmosphere in order to rescue the Big Buddha. Our crews are hard at work servicing your fighters. Once they are rearmed and repaired, you can thank them by supporting our retreat to Beta Volantis. 

I believe it is only fair that I inform you where I stand in all this. Your Fleetmaster may have convinced me to take part in his plan, but he has not gained my trust. At least, not yet. I'm taking a great risk in joining his exodus. There are thirty thousand survivors under my care whom I must protect at all costs. Tyrone had better be well prepared if his goal is to get us out of Sol alive. Otherwise, all my efforts to save this small human enclave will have been for nothing. 

In any case, we are, as your squadmaster said himself, 'in the same boat now.' One of our deck officers will show you to your cabins. Take time to rest, eat something and get a shower. All of you need to be at full combat readiness when my fleet reaches the rallying point."

7037, "Your squadron failed in its mission to locate and retrieve the Big Buddha and the missing refuge convoy from Uranus. Soon after you reached the allied rally point, it was compromised and came under attack by multiple Shivan bomber wings. Despite the valiant effort of the Avalonians and other escort wings, the Syndicate's ships didn't make it out of Uranus alive."

7038, "The ORS patrol sent to locate Europa's missing refugee convoy failed in accomplishing its objectives. The pilots who participated in the mission became separated by the planet's dense gas clouds. Failing to re-establish contact, Beta wing was officially listed by Valhalla as MIA. The rescue operation in this theatre was also suspended as a result."

7103, "Acknowledged, Alpha 1. Receiving visual confirmation now. This...is a disaster. It looks like they came under Shivan attack shortly after arrival. Any sign of survivors?"

7104, " Negative, Command. I'm not reading any lifesigns in this debris."

7105, "You are racing against the clock, pilots. Each passing second reduces our chances of finding those ships intact. Keep searching. You need to locate the Big Buddha or confirm its destruction."

7106, "Roger that, Command. All fighters, form up on me. Let's get moving."

7107, " I keep thinking.... Forty ships. Let's say they carry a thousand passengers each. First attacking the comm nodes and then this entire rescue mission.... Billions are losing their lives right now. Why is Command sending us to the ass end of the solar system in order to save just forty thousand people instead?"

7108, "Spark, c'mon. Our superior officers issue us orders and we follow them to the letter. That's how the military works. Isn't it about time you stopped questioning our orders?"

7109, "The kid has a point, Widow. The refugees don't seem to bother Command all that much. There's something else this convoy has that the ORS wants retrieved. I don't know...weapons? Supplies? Secret technologies? What could be that important?"

7110, "Arbiter Hemming said the mobile shipyard was our priority. Remember back at Valhalla Station? Three frigates were put at risk just to save the Ida Lewis and that was a single factory ship. I'm assuming its 'necessity' is somehow connected."

7111, "We still don't know what they intend to do with those factory ships. Sure, we could move our entire industry into space just like we did during the Rim Conflict. But how long could we last in resisting the Shivans that way?"

7112, "You asked me that once before, Widow. Look, the ORS is gonna find a way through all this. They always do. At the very least, believing that might somehow grant us a glimmer of hope in this war. "

7113, "Enemy contact! We've got incoming Shivan fighters! "

7114, "All fighters, break and attack! Make sure not to stray too far apart or we'll never find our way back to each other!"

7115, "Shivans neutralized. Area is secure. "

7116, "Good. Let's keep moving. If the Shivans are already here, then the Big Buddha could be in some really big trouble right about now. "

7117, "I'm picking up more derelict ships..."

7118, "Terran fighters! Thank God! I've got Shivans right on my tail! Please, help me out! "

7119, "Coming right to you, pilot! Just keep heading our way! "

7120, "They've caught up with me! I can't shake them off! Nooo--"

7121, "He's down! Damn them! But that means there are still Terran ships out here somewhere! Now we're definitely running out of time to find them!"

7125, "Zeta 1, repeat your last. Just stay where you are. We're coming right to you. It's going to be alright-"

7128, "Blasted Shivans! We lost his signal!"

7129, "We'd never have reached him in time, Widow. Squadmaster, I have the Big Buddha's coordinates! It's not far from our current location. Let's move!"

7130, "Great job, kid. Let's kick the afterburners and get to that flying scrapheap before there's nothing left for us to save."

7131, "I've got new Shivan signatures on my sensors but they're not targeting us! They must be attacking the refugee ships!"

7132, "I see them! Alright, kiddies, our lost birds are straight ahead! Break those Shivan formations apart and try to lure them away from the refugees!"

7133, "This is Shipmaster Donnelly of the Graf Zeppelin hailing unidentified Syndicate fighters! Target Brahma and Indra bombers! They are close to your position and rapidly approaching the Big Buddha as well as the Graf Zeppelin!"

7134, "Unidentified fighters, this is the Graf Zeppelin. You have our thanks for your timely intervention. You would be most welcome to join our forces and follow us deeper into Uranus. "

7135, "Graf Zeppelin, this is Alpha 1 of the 49th Avalonians, Uranus Recon Force. Thanks for your, uh, hospitality, but we're actually here to retrieve you from this place. Command is looking forward to seeing their precious mobile shipyard again."

7136, "We're not going anywhere, pilot. Can't you see the simple fact that the war is lost? We and the Federates used everything we had against the Shivans. All of it...was simply not enough. I wish the ORS the rest of the Syndicate could see our struggle with the same clarity that I have."

7137, "Well, I guess we know why they weren't broadcasting any distress signals. They didn't want to be found. Not even by us. "

7138, "I can't believe what I'm hearing! You can't be serious about just hiding here, sir. Billions of people are dying out there!"

7139, "That is exactly why we're hiding, pilot. Because billions are dying everywhere else. What could Big Buddha possibly give the ORS now? Two or three frigates repaired and returned to the frontline? Supplies for one more futile counterattack? "

7140, "I realized we can no longer fight the Shivans. I also realized I can contribute to mankind's survival in ways other than supporting the failing Syndicate until the bitter end. One day, the Shivans will leave. Our only hope is to remain hidden until that moment comes. "

7141, "Do you honestly believe your own words, sir? Hide from them? You're fighting for survival like we are! Stay here and you'll end up running like prey until the Shivans hunt you down to the last. Is helping humanity's extinction along what you truly want?"

7142, "Calm down, kid! I don't like this either but playing fuckin' diplomat is not our mission. I'm establishing a connection with Command. Let's see how persuasive they can be with these guys."

7143, "Command, this is Alpha 1 of the 49th Avalonians, Uranus Recon Force. Do you copy?"

7144, "Loud and clear, Alpha 1. Did you find the Big Buddha? Is it ready to depart? "

7145, "Oh, boy... Yes, we found it. However, the commander of the Graf Zeppelin is not likely to give it back. I'm patching him through so you can hear his story. Just a little heads-up? It's not easy to listen to without a glass of whiskey."

7146, " Command, this is Shipmaster Donnelly of the ORCa Graf Zeppelin. I will only repeat to you what I already told your pilot. We are not going to rejoin your war. The Big Buddha is staying with my convoy."

7147, "That decision is not yours to make, Shipmaster. If you intend to keep the Big Buddha from us, you and your subordinates will be considered traitors to the Syndicate and treated accordingly."

7148, "Don't make me laugh, Command! The Syndicate is dead, just like the Federated Nations! You no longer have any jurisdiction here. My convoy is not part of the Syndicate any longer. We're just Terrans who want to get away from danger."

7149, "This is your last warning, Shipmaster Donnelly. If the Big Buddha is not returned to our control, then you force our hand. We will use any means necessary to--"

7150, "Forgive the interjection, Command, but we don't want any bloodshed here. Please, allow me to handle this situation personally."

7151, "If that is your wish, Fleetmaster Tyrone. You may proceed."

7152, "Fleetmaster Tyrone? The great Horatio Tyrone himself? I'm impressed that you've managed to survive the Shivans this long. Is the Big Buddha really that important to the Syndicate?"

7153, "Yes, it is, Shipmaster Donnelly. The Syndicate doesn't need the Big Buddha to continue the war in Sol. You are right. We lost. We cannot continue to resist the Shivans the way we have so far. Billions of people are dead and our worlds are now lifeless hunks of rock."

7154, "But mankind isn't extinct yet. We have rallied over a million survivors. They are crossing through subspace into Beta Volantis as we speak. We are abandoning Sol in search of a new home, one that is far enough away from the Shivans to ensure our safety."

7155, "If we are to succeed, then we need all the help we can get. That includes you, Shipmaster Donnelly. We also need the Big Buddha to maintain our ships. I know you want to give those refugees a chance to survive. Join us and you'll be giving them so much more."

7156, "One million survivors... Fleetmaster, I had no idea about your plans. The Syndicate is really going to abandon the Sol system?"

7157, "That is correct. We will be waiting for you at our rallying point near the Beta Volantis jump node, Shipmaster. Godspeed to you and all the people you swore to protect. Fleetmaster Tyrone, out."

7158, "All units, stand by. I'm sending you a new set of coordinates. Prepare to jump to the Beta Volantis node on my command."

7159, "Well, I'll be damned. Looks like these guys will be joining us after all."

7160, "Holy shit.... Leave Sol? They were really able to execute such a plan in secret? If they had revealed all this to us much sooner..."

7161, "Then things could've turned out a lot differently. For better or worse. That's how the military works, kid. We both know it all too well."

7162, "All fighter escorts, the Graf Zeppelin's hangar crews are ready to receive you. Avalonians, you are also welcome to land. We'll gladly resupply your fighters while the convoy jumps to the node. "

7163, "We would be honored, Shipmaster Donnelly. Seems like we're in the same boat now. Alright, Avalonians, park yourselves on the Graf Zeppelin and let's test our new allies' hospitality..."

7164, "Can you identify any wreckage that might belong to the Big Buddha?"

7165, "That's a neg, Command. Mostly smaller civilian ships and trashed fighters. Nothing we're seeing was ever part of the Big Buddha. I'm sure of it."

7166, "Mission failed

Graf Zeppelin has been destroyed"

7167, "Mission failed

Big Buddha has been destroyed"

7168, "Spark! Stop lagging behind and get back here! We've got a job to do."

7170, "Mission failed

You got lost"

7171, "I present this offer to you, pilots. With the Big Buddha and all these cargo-laden supply ships, this small human enclave can outlast the Shivan invasion. We will hide here until the Shivans leave Sol. If you wish to join us, you may do so. If not, leave us in peace."

7172, "We sacrificed a lot to get to this point. I certainly hope this whole rescue mission is worth it."

7173, "These Europans require our help, my friend. Of course it is worth it. "

7174, "Cut the chatter, people, and stay alert. We're flying almost blind in these clouds."

7175, "Still nothing. This could be a trap. I'm not detecting any allied units at these coordinates."

7176, "We're still too far away. Our long range sensors are next to useless in all this gas. We've got to get closer. "

You now have access to the $y ORM $y Vortex, a multi-purpose swarm missile created by engineering specialists onboard the $G Big $G Buddha.

The Big Buddha and Graf Zeppelin can withstand a few Shivan torpedoes, but the Elysium and Chronos transports will not survive without protection."

7284, " Alright everybody, here's the game plan. Work together, choose your targets carefully and watch for enemy bombers. Don't let any fighters distract you. Any questions?"

7285, "Negative, boss. We're ready for this. "

7294, "Mayday! Mayday! This is the ORC Liberator requesting immediate support! Shivan forces are right behind us and have targeted our convoy! Get some fighters over here stat!"

7295, "Alpha, Beta, hit your afterburners and quickly form up on the Liberator's convoy. Graf Zeppelin, I know what our deal was, but you are well within the Ironclad's firing envelope. Those ships need our help more than you do right now."

7296, "I concur, Alpha 1. Some of my own escort fighters will be sent to assist them as well. Consider this my repayment for everything the ORS has done for my people."

7298, "More civilian vessels are entering the field of battle. By Allah, there are a lot of them...."

7299, " There are too many ships out here, Squadmaster! We can't possibly protect them all!"

7300, "I'm not gonna leave anybody behind if I can help it, Widow. Beta, cover the convoy that's being led by the Lysithea. Alpha, the second group is ours. Everyone else stays right here."

7301, "ORFg Dioscuri has arrived and we brought some friends. We're on our way to Beta Volantis. Could we borrow some fighter cover until our convoy hits the node?"

7302, "Fighters from the Graf Zeppelin, your new priority is to escort our retreating warships. Alpha and Beta, stay exactly where you are! "

7303, "You're crazy, Harper! We were told to only prioritize a few ships! If we stretch ourselves thin, we risk losing all of them!"

7304, "Damn it, Widow! We are not leaving anyone behind! I gave you a fuckin' direct order! Now shut the hell up and follow it!"

7305, "We got a problem, boss. My scope shows a massive subspace signature closing fast! Something big is about to show up!"

7306, "Oh, what the fuck now-- Jesus, that destroyer is huge!"

7307, "That's a Samael-class destroyer, designation Cimejes. Samael destroyers are rare, but extremely deadly. Everyone, stand clear of those warships. There's absolutely nothing we can do for them...."

7308, "This is the Ironclad. We are sortieing bombers for a subsystem strike against the Cimejes. Alpha and Beta, provide close range escort! That monstrosity's teeth have to be pulled out if we are to hold our position!"

7309, "You heard the man, Avalonians! Our job is to smash everything between our bombers and the Cimejes! Get it done!"

7310, "The cavalry has arrived, Ironclad. I figured several extra large guns would be a major boon right about now."

7311, "Glad you could finally make it, Le Brunon. I expected you here three hours ago. Where the hell have you been!?"

7312, "Better late than never, Fleetmaster. We had some difficulty getting here, but I see my timing is still as good as ever. We'll help you out with that big bastard over there."

7313, "The Cimejes is closing the distance on us. Delta and Epsilon, double time it! I want those forward beam cannons neutralized RIGHT NOW!"

7314, "Delta, Epsilon, disarm the Cimejes ASAP! Put your Defilers and torpedoes to work! Those beam cannons need to go yesterday!"

7315, "This is the ORC Viper! We've been hit! We're losing control over critical systems! Structural integrity collapsing!"

7316, "Dioscuri here! We have hull breaches on three decks! I'm sorry, Ironclad. It looks like we won't be joining--"

7317, "Ironclad here. The Cimejes is now in range. Gunnery control, target all available railguns on the Cimejes! Load heavy ordnance and fire at will!"

7318, "Delta Lead to Ironclad. The Cimejes' primary beam cannons have been destroyed! Give 'em hell, sir!"

7319, "The Cimejes will never threaten us again. Great work, all of you!"

7320, "We are not reading any additional hostile forces. All units, proceed to the jump node immediately. The Ironclad will remain behind and provide cover to any survivors still en route to this location. "

7321, "And one more thing... Say goodbye to Sol. This is the last time that any of us will ever see our ancestral home again."

7322, "Fleetmaster Tyrone is right. We're never going to see Sol again. Io, Europa, Ganymede, Mars, Earth... All the worlds that were once home to us..."

7323, "...are now gone, kid. Nothing ties us here anymore. Let's kill the chatter for a brief moment while we finish up our work."

7324, "The Dioscuri and her cruisers are gone! The Cimejes is not slowing down...hell, it's headin' straight for the Ironclad!"

7325, "This is the Harmattan! The Shivans are inflicting severe damage against us! We need some assistance over here ASAP! "

7326, "This is the Damocles! We need additional fighter support right now! Otherwise, the Shivans will tear us apart!"

7327, "Yeah...you're right, boss. I just... Alright, let's go. Maybe there's a home for us somewhere out there. Remote, undiscovered, free of the Shivans...and waiting for us."

Excellent work out there, pilots. You successfully drove off a Shivan attack on a civilian convoy.

In our current situation, every life we can save is priceless."

You did well, pilots. Shivan forces took the convoy by surprise and inflicted major damage, but you successfully drove the enemy off. Regrettably, we sustained civilian casualties in this engagement.

7527, "$B Fleetmaster $B Tyrone: 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin with a word of welcome for all new pilots and crewmembers. I am $y Horatio $y Tyrone, commanding officer of the $G Ironclad and one of the three surviving fleetmasters in the Exodus Fleet, along with $y Fleetmaster $y Hector $y Caliphtys and $y Fleetmaster $y Aasira $y Raji. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the $G Ironclad as you begin or continue your service to the $G Syndicate $G Exodus $G Fleet."

7528, "As you all know, the Fleet is still reorganizing after a narrow escape from the Sol system. We have travelled through previously uncharted jump nodes in a rush in order to escape the Shivan armada. Now that we are relatively safe and only have to deal with minor groups of Shivans, we are taking time to rest up, count the survivors, replenish our supplies, and carefully plan our next steps. 
 
$y Fleetmaster $y Caliphtys and $y High $y Magistrate $y Al-Zardari will both be briefing the Fleet at 18:00 today to let everyone know of our overall strategy. For now, let me focus on issues directly concerning you and our ship."

7529, "The $G Ironclad is the only Orion-class destroyer that survived the Exodus. Although its corridors carry many memories of the Great War, it is still my great honor to command it decades later during this difficult time. Despite its age, the $G Ironclad has been outfitted with enhanced reactors, a modern jump drive, and the latest generation of Syndicate heavy railguns and Swarm missile launchers. It is a fully operational warship capable of acting as a command center, spearheading our offensives, and serving as a bulwark against the Shivans. 

It is a ship with both great history and a promising future. "

7530, "Fleetmaster Caliphtys will provide details of the fleet's new structure. But before that, I'd like to lift the veil of secrecy about the Ironclad's role in the Exodus Fleet. 

While the majority of the remaining Syndicate warships will report directly to Fleetmaster Caliphtys, the Ironclad and a detachment of Vitalius frigates, Syr Darya carriers, and Amalthea cruisers will form an autonomous force called the $G Roaming $G Fleet. We will serve as both a vanguard and a rear guard for the Exodus Fleet. We will operate far from the civilian ships, clear the path for the rest of the Fleet, and strike at any Shivan pursuers. 

Make no mistake: this will be a challenging assignment. For this reason, I have selected my most seasoned and trustworthy shipmasters to support me in this difficult task. 

This is it, everyone. If you wanted to be a hero for humanity and perform missions no one else could complete, you've come to the right place. If not...well, maybe you'll get to be a hero anyway."

7531, "I have spent 15 years in the Syndicate military, fighting for a better future for all of us. I believe in Syndicate virtues. I believe in freedom. It pains me to remember that when our victory over the Federation was so close at hand, the Shivans arrived...and took our future from us. 

We will strike back. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday we will have our revenge. Together."

7532, "I know there are experienced pilots among us, transferred from frigates, carriers, and civilian ships. I would like to address my next words to you. 
 
I know you have all had to sacrifice a lot. But now you must become an example to others. Because of our losses, we've had to pull pilots from all corners of the Exodus Fleet--people who never planned to see combat until the apocalypse forced them into duty. It is your responsibility to take care of them. To show them the way. To help them overcome their fears. 

Treat this just as you would any other mission objective. If we want to survive in the long run, we will need every pilot at their best, old and new.

That is all, pilots. Ad astra per aspera. Report to your tactical arbiters for your next mission briefing."

7533, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Jesper $B Thynne:
All right, let's get started. I see a lot of new faces here. I always hated greetings. I hate formalities and I hate having to remember new people's names. But as long as you're here, welcome to the $G 114th $G Direwolves, one of the top fighter squadrons on the $G ORD $G Ironclad. I know some of you previously served on the $G Graf $G Zeppelin and the $G Castor, which were both assigned to assist Shipmaster Wisniowiecki as our vanguard in $B Delta $B Lacertae. For others, it's your first assignment and your first day as pilots of the Exodus Fleet. 

I'm sure the Fleetmaster already serenaded you with a grand speech that swept you off your feet. I'm a practical man, so I'll get right to the point."

7534, "Most of you know a little about Fleetmaster Tyrone, so you are aware that you are not going to be bored here. Any pilot who serves on board the $G Ironclad quickly learns that if the $G ORS needs someone to get their hands dirty, Fleetmaster Tyrone's finest pilots must be always ready for action. 
 
 We will play a crucial role in the pending operation of moving the fleet to $B Delta $B Lacertae. You're now pilots of the $G Roaming $G Fleet. Congratulations—you are now hereby officially fucked."

7535, "The standard fighter we use is the $G ORF $G Encantona, a versatile... 

Squadmaster Harper, what's with that death glare? ...Okay, I get it, you've heard the stories about the new Syndicate fighter. Look, I didn't choose it. I wouldn't want to enter that cockpit even if they paid me a million credits. But here are the facts: we've lost our industry in Sol, and we've only just begun production on our factory ships. The Encantona is cheap and easy to produce from spare parts and ores easily mined from asteroids. 

I know it's not a perfect design. It's just a refurbished patrol craft with a basic jump drive, and it lacks the firepower of the Defender or Claymore. But it's fast and agile, and it has pretty strong shields for its class. It'll be enough to do the job.

The biggest issue with the Encantona is that your weapon selection will be limited to one primary and one secondary bank. However, we can customize each Encantona into one of two variants. The most common one has a larger secondary payload bank, but for those of you who prefer to stick to primaries, our engineering crews can add a second primary bank at the expense of missile capacity."

7536, "Extended payload variant"

7537, "Double-gun variant"

7538, "All right, let's get to it. Less than an hour ago, a remote patrol from the $G Ironclad detected a mysterious signal coming from the $B N-476 $B nebula located just beyond Cor Caroli's Oort cloud. The signal is of Terran origin, which indicates a single ship or a drone that got lost or crash-jumped. It's possible we lost a ship while we were trying to get organized during our arrival in $B Cor $B Caroli. 
 
 The signal is being disrupted by the nebula's electromagnetic storms, but we've been able to confirm that it is encrypted via the military standard common code devised by both the ORS and EFN during the early days of the Shivan Invasion. 

We need you to find out what's going on. If there's someone who needs help, contact the $G Ironclad so we can deploy a rescue team.
"

7539, "N-476"

7540, "Be advised that $B N-476 is extremely dense and has much more electrical activity than the gas giants you flew in back home. We expect that you'll be operating in an environment with lots of comm interference and very limited sensor range.
 
 This won't be the easiest first assignment, so stay together and rely on one another. "

7541, "After you launch from the $G Ironclad, stand by until we send you the coordinates of the signal source. 

If any Terrans are out there, bring them home. That's all. Good luck, pilots."

7543, "Inciona"

7544, "Tactical Arbiter Thynne: 
Well, Squadmaster Harper, everyone, your reputation was not exaggerated at all. Now I see why you were able to survive all those battles in Sol when you were still assigned to the 49th Avalonians. Not only did you nullify the Shivan flotilla that controlled nebula N-476, but you also outmaneuvered the Federate forces who showed up there. This is exactly what we expected from pilots of your caliber. 

Concerning events that happened during the mission, here's the official story and I advise you to remember it. The Minerva came under Shivan attack and made a crash-jump to the nebula. The Midwinter's commanding officer, still distrustful of the ORS, disobeyed orders and tried to retrieve the ship on his own initiative, which resulted in a clash with our rescue mission led by the Halifax. ORS marines retrieved the Minerva and confirmed that its crew was killed by an overload during a crash jump. The ship is now being repaired and prepared for the replacement crew's arrival. 

Remember that the events of the mission are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone else. 

That's all, pilots. Go get some rest. You've earned it."

7545, "The Direwolves' first sortie was a disaster. You let the enemy take out the ORFg Halifax, which destroyed any hope of retrieving the Minerva. On top of that, we'll have to move forward without Shipmaster Hartwick and his unique skillset.
	
	I had high expectations for your squadron, Squadmaster Harper. It's now painfully clear that we got our hopes up for nothing. "

7546, "The Direwolves failed to protect the EFFg Midwinter. Squadmaster Harper, I've read reports of your past sorties against the Shivans. I know you and your squadron could have taken out the hostiles that attacked the Midwinter.

But you failed. The Midwinter could have been saved, but you didn't get the job done. This is an unacceptable outcome."

7617, "McFadden, sir. Andrew McFadden. I'm 16. Everyone calls me Fives. Flying Beta 3 is Bart Dyer, callsign Echo. We're both refugees from Calixta, the biggest mining center on Io."

7618, "Okay, Fives. You're young, but you've got spirit. Are you willing to fight?"

7619, " I am, sir. I promise. The Shivans took everything from me. Killed off everyone I knew. Except Echo. We both tried to earn some cash to bribe our families onto the Abraham... We were flying back to Calixta when the bombardment began. We...didn't get there in time to save them."

7620, "Remember what the Fleetmaster said? About payback? I want to fight the Shivans, sir. That's all I've got left. Just tell me what to do. And I'll do my best. "

7621, "I hear you, kid. You'll get your chance. But don't let that anger take over. If you enter a fight without a cool head and lean on adrenaline...you'll make a mistake. And then you're dead."

7622, "I know it's asking a lot, but I need all of you to set aside your need for vengeance. There won't be a war for payback. No revenge. No glory. It's just us and a handful of other survivors. We're just trying to survive. "

7623, "Alpha, Beta, we are transferring coordinates to your fighters. You're good to go. Good luck. "

7624, "Got it, Ironclad. Alright, everyone, confirm the coordinates, prepare your jump sequence, and wait for my mark. Remember: stay together or you'll get lost in the damn nebula. Everyone ready? "

7640, "Come on, you sons of bitches, come on... "

7641, "Kurma and Durga wings eliminated. Nicely done. Form up and let's get back on course. "

7642, "Boss, I'm picking up more Shivan signatures ahead. At least one Moloch frigate and two cruisers, a Cain and a Daeva. We'd better avoid them for now. They seem to surround the source of the signal, but whatever it is, they aren't attacking it. "

7643, "Wait, I've got a lock on the source. It's a Federate cruiser! The EFC Minerva, Viscount-class. Picking up no life signs, but I can't approach her to confirm with all these Shivans around. "

7644, "I don't know what lured the Shivans here, but it seems someone else is crashing the party. Looks like a frigate closing from the other side. I can't get a visual, but I don't think it's Shivan. "

7645, "Follow me, pilots. Let's approach the new target and evade the Shivans for now. Slowly and carefully. We don't know what we're up against.  "

7646, "That's a Vidar-class frigate. I'd recognize them anywhere. More Federates are here! What are these dogs looking for?"

7647, "Unidentified ORS fighters, this is the EFFg Midwinter, requesting assistance. We are now in close combat with the SFg Hesediel. The SC Dahaka is closing in. Try to take out their beam cannons before they finish us off! We've got additional enemy forces in the area."

7648, "Well, we went looking for trouble and we found it. I'm slowly getting used to saving Federate assholes instead of killing them. Alright, Midwinter, this is Alpha and Beta wings, 114th Direwolves, ORD Ironclad. We're on our way to help."

7649, "Ironclad, this is Alpha 1. Just wanna let you know... a Federate frigate, the Midwinter, is looking for the signal source as well. Don't know what they're playing at, but you'd better send some backup while they're busy with the Shivans. "

7650, "Acknowledged, Alpha 1. Focus on the Shivans and keep an eye on the Federates. We are deploying reinforcements."

7651, "All fighters, be advised, a bomber wing with escort fighters is coming this way! Destroy Indra and Shiva wings before they can hit us!"

7652, "The Hesediel just went down. Scratch one Shivan frigate. "

7653, "We have destroyed the Dahaka. "

7654, "We took down the Hesediel and Dahaka, but that was just the first wave. More Shivan warships are holding position nearby. Alpha, Beta, we need you to... "

7655, "Slow down, Midwinter. We don't take orders from you. You shouldn't even be here at all. But here you are and that's making me nervous."

7656, "<PRIVATE CHANNEL> Hey, kids, see Axe wing? Keep an eye on them. The Midwinter's jump drive is still recharging, but these escort fighters might try something stupid. "

7657, "Alright, Midwinter, I'll ask only once: why are you here? What's emitting this damn signal, and why are the Shivans after it too? "

7658, "I am not going to explain my objectives to a Syndicate pilot. I answer only to Rear Admiral Leibniz."

7659, "Midwinter, the rest of the Shivan warships are on the move. They'll be in firing range in two minutes! We're not gonna make it out of here by ourselves!"

7660, "Shit, things are getting bad! Multiple wings of fighters, closing fast! "

7661, "We'll never break through this fighter screen! We can't destroy the beams, Midwinter! We can't get through!"

7662, "Argh! Leibniz, to hell with you, my crew's not gonna die for you. We are falling back and cycling our jump drive. All fighters, cover our retreat! "

7663, "They're cutting through our decks like we're made of butter! Hull failure is imminent! "

7664, "Incoming jump signature! Syndicate frigate, Vitalius-class! It's the Halifax! "

7665, "Forward batteries, lock on those Shivan warships and fire. I want them all dead."

7666, "That's Shipmaster Hartwick! He's Fleetmaster Tyrone's specialist for top priority missions. Tyrone's brought out the heavy artillery."

7667, "Midwinter, maintain your current position. Help us destroy the Shivans if you can. Don't even try to escape. I can lock on your jump drive before it is recharged. Let's deal with this petty Shivan flotilla together... and then we can talk."

7668, "Alpha, if the Midwinter makes any attempt to depart, you are authorized to disable the ship and destroy its escort. Beta, detach and clear a path for the bombers. Call in Jota wing once you are in position near the Shivan warships."

7669, "On it, Halifax. Alright, Spark, you help Hartwick deal with the Shivans and I'll make sure our Federate 'friends' don't do anything stupid. "

7670, "Rama wing inbound. They're going for the Midwinter!"

7671, "Beta, stay focused on the warships! We'll keep the Midwinter safe! "

7672, "The Enepsigos just went down for the count."

7673, "The Uzza is going down. Scratch one Shivan cruiser."

7674, "The SC Saleos is history."

7675, "This petty annoyance has been dealt with. Now let's focus on our true objective. I suppose you have something to say, Midwinter? "

7676, "Halifax, we did not come here with hostile intentions. We received a Federate distress code from this area. We just wanted to get one of our own to safety."

7677, "I can tell you on the private channel what I think of your fairy tale. We are taking over the Minerva. Our boarding party is already on the way. I advise you to stay where you are and perhaps Fleetmaster Tyrone will forgive your insubordination."

7678, "Ah fuck, the Midwinter's opened fire! It's deploying bombers! Weapons hot, kids, take them down! "

7679, "Federate bastards! They're going after the Halifax! Spark, we need you here now! "

7680, "Very foolish of you, Midwinter. Escort fighters, destroy those bombers. I will deal with the Midwinter myself. "

7681, "We've taken care of the bombers. "

7682, "Just like old times... "

7683, "This was your best move, Midwinter? Pathetic. You are going to pay for your insolence. Engineering, divert power reserves to main batteries. Gunnery control, concentrate firepower. "

7684, " We surrender! Hold your fire, Hartwick, hold your fire! You won. You are free to take the Minerva. I only ask that you spare my crew. The decision to attack you was mine and mine alone."

7685, "You are in no position to ask me for anything. Shut down your jump drive, power down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded. We should've never accepted you in the Fleet, Federate scum."

7686, "That will not be necessary, Shipmaster Hartwick. This is Rear Admiral Leibniz of the EFD Redemption. Midwinter, you are ordered to abort your mission and rendezvous with the Redemption at once. You have already put enough lives at risk today."

7687, "Y-yes, sir. Immediately, sir."

7688, "Hartwick, you may carry on with your operation. I will deal with my subordinate. Rest assured, I will settle this matter with Fleetmaster Tyrone."

7689, "This is Theta 1, now en route to the Minerva's docking station."

7690, "Spark, provide cover to the transport. We'll stay with Halifax. "

7691, "Enter on my mark. Three, two, one, mark! Lock and load, boys! Secure the ship!"

7692, "No signs of life on the bridge, Halifax. Moving on to engineering. "

7693, "We're in position. Securing the objective and mov--"

7694, "They've just switched to an encrypted channel. That's... interesting."

7695, "This is insane! What were the Federates hiding here? Why was this ship abandoned? Why did it leave the Fleet in the first place? "

7696, "No idea, Fives. Better give it up now. It's none of our business. We don't want any trouble."

7697, "For now I agree with Echo. Let's just get those ships to safety. "

7698, "Gamma and Epsilon wings of the 267th Varangians now in position. Alpha and Beta, you are relieved. Return to the Ironclad. We'll make sure the Minerva is repaired and ready to rejoin the Fleet."

7699, "Halifax to escort fighters, step up your pathetic efforts. We are under intense fire and are taking damage. "

7700, "Spare me your threats, Halifax. I do not report to Fleetmaster Tyrone. I am going to make sure the Minerva is retrieved, with or without your permission."

7701, "You are balancing on the edge, Midwinter. As you wish, you may accompany the Halifax while our marines secure the Minerva. But should you make any attempt to stop us, I will treat it as treason. "

7702, "The Minerva is not responding to any calls and scans show no life signs aboard. We need to know what happened on board. The friends and families of Minerva's crew deserve to know their fate."

7703, "Those Shivan bastards are relentless. Escort fighters, intercept Deva wing and its escort now."

7705, "Damage control in progress. Outer hull plate restored and ready.  "

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As you all know, for five days the fleet has been holding position in $B Cor $B Caroli. We needed time to regroup after a narrow escape from the $B Solar $B System and prepare for the battles that lie ahead. 

However, we cannot afford to stay here any longer. The Shivan armada that destroyed Earth has begun pursuing us. Our only option is to fight our way forward and deal with the Shivan forces in our path while staying ahead of the forces chasing us. We will face threats on multiple fronts, and if we are to stand our ground, each of you must fulfill your duties and remain obedient to your superior officers.

Take a moment to look around you. Those of us who are children of $B Io, $B Europa, and $B Ganymede now stand among people from $B Mars and $B Earth. Not long ago, this simple difference would have made you enemies. For some of you, hatred of the $quoteother side$quote is in your blood. But it's time to set all of that aside. 

We, collectively, are all that remains of humanity. If we want to survive, we must put aside our differences and stand together as one fleet, one nation, and one human race. "

 This may seem to you like the end. In many ways, it is. We are no longer Terrans anymore. We are nomads, homeless outcasts seeking their place in the galaxy. 
 
 But this is also the beginning: the beginning of the future of the human race.

You are now members of the $G Syndicate $G Exodus $G Fleet. It is our safe haven, our shield, and our iron fist. As long as the Fleet stands, humanity will survive. 

The Exodus Fleet consists of more than 1,500 ships and is home to one million, one hundred thousand, six hundred and seven souls. Yes, we confirmed the count of every single human who survived the Shivan invasion of the Sol system. That is what is left of humanity. The billions of Terrans who were killed on $B Earth, $B Mars, $B Europa and the other worlds of the Sol system are now simply a memory. 

Perhaps someday we shall return and retrieve what is ours. Perhaps someday we will take Sol back. But it is not this day. This day we need to forget about our former pride and glory, and we must focus on one single objective: survival. "

7719, "In order to manage such a vast fleet of ships, the Fleetmasters have agreed to group them into semi-autonomous battle groups. 

The $G Roaming $G Fleet will be our primary assault force. It consists of our heaviest, most powerful ships and will serve as both front and rear guard for the fleet. It was created to lead offensives, launch counterattacks, break Shivan formations, clear a path for the rest of the fleet, and strike deadly blows to the pursuing Shivan forces. Our most accomplished commander, $w Fleetmaster $w Horatio $w Tyrone, has full authority over the Roaming Fleet.  

The remaining part of the former ORS Navy  has been formed into the $G Escort $G Fleet, a unit assigned to defend non-combat vessels and protect them from Shivan attacks when the fleet is on the move. As High Fleetmaster of Exodus Fleet, I have personally taken command over Escort Fleet. 

I have assigned $w Fleetmaster $w Aasira $w Raji, commanding officer of the $G ORD $G Anjaneya, as my deputy. Fleetmaster Raji will also command a detachment of the Escort Fleet known as the $G Heavy $G Fleet, which will consist of ships with enough firepower to support the Roaming Fleet or conduct independent offensive operations if necessary."

7720, "As you know, a group of Federate ships led by $w Rear $w Admiral $w Victor $w Leibniz of the $G EFD $G Redemption survived the fall of Earth and helped us evacuate the Outer Rim in the final stage of the Great Exodus. For that we accepted them as friends, comrades, and allies, and they too will be part of the Exodus Fleet.  
 
 Rear Admiral Leibniz has formed the $G Federate $G Taskforce, which will assist the Escort Fleet in defending our main staging areas. Elements of the Federate Taskforce will also be deployed to support the Roaming Fleet as necessary.

Finally, all non-combat vessels have been assigned to the $G Colony $G Fleet. This will be our mobile home for the remainder of the human race. The Colony Fleet will consist of civilian vessels, supply ships, miners, mobile factories, transports, freighters, and science vessels. They might not not be equipped for combat, but their resources and personnel are essential to our survival."

7721, "I would also like to address the status of the Outer Rim Syndicate government. To this end, I have met with the ORS government officials who survived the Exodus.  
 
 The safety of the fleet requires military commanders to have final authority over civilian leadership. However, the ORS was created in opposition to authoritarian EFN rule, and unchecked military rule could easily lead us down that same path. I stand by the principles on which the ORS was founded, and I can assure you that the death of Sol will not mean the death of our civil liberties. 

Earlier today, I convened the $G Syndicate $G Magistratorium to act as the governing body for the Colony Fleet and represent its people before me and the other military commanders. One of our colony ships, the Spirit of Hope, will serve as the seat of our civilian government. 

We stand loyal to ORS virtues, and to that end, I have appointed $B Muhammad $B Al-Zardari to serve as $B High $B Magistrate, just as he did before the Exodus. He will serve out the remainder of his term, which by law will continue for the next three years and seven months, and then elections for a new government will take place."

7722, "In addition to management of the Colony Fleet's everyday business, the High Magistrate has appointed an elite team called the Navigators, which consists of our most skilled and knowledgeable scientists. They will be responsible for analyzing data on our surrounding space systems and selecting an optimal path for the Fleet. The Navigators have the best technological solutions at their disposal, including a network of quantum computers. With their help, we can consistently stay one step ahead of the Shivans.

The High Magistrate's clerks will soon be done updating our database with entries on ships, weapons, and our current situation. We recommend that everyone stay up to date on the newest information. "

7723, "That concludes the major fleet-related announcements. I would now like to address our current status and our next move.
 
The Ironclad's battlegroup has maintained a nearly impenetrable blockade, as only a few Shivan stragglers have been able to get past the blockade to attack the Colony Fleet. This has given us a five-day period in $B Cor $B Caroli to regroup our forces, replenish our supplies, and repair damage to our ships. It is now time to leave.

Our next destination is the $B Delta $B Lacertae system. Reconnaissance flights indicate that Shivan forces are present in this system, but not in significant numbers--we expect only a few skirmishers that pose no threat to the Roaming Fleet.

Our greatest concern is the Shivan armada pursuing us. That armada is on its way to $B Cor $B Caroli as I speak and has enough firepower to take out our entire fleet in a full-scale engagement. We do not plan to wait around until it arrives.
 
That is all. We will need everyone in the fleet at their very best in the days ahead."

7724, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne:
Alright, pilots, this is your lucky day. Your next objective is going to be an easy one. You will be deployed to oversee civilian convoys as they travel to $B Delta $B Lacertae. $G Escort $G Fleet frigates $G Inciona and $G Actaeon are already providing cover, but with the entire civilian fleet in transit, we are sending additional fighters to support the most vulnerable convoys. 

We do not expect much trouble. The Fleet has already eliminated the Shivan forces which got past the blockade, and the $G Ironclad is still holding the enemy near the portal to $R Naos. "

7725, "Colony Fleet"

7726, "After you launch from the $G Ironclad, stand by until we send you the coordinates of the first convoy. When you are in position, officers from the $G Escort $G Fleet will give you further orders. You will escort civilian convoys to the $B Delta $B Lacertae jump node until another wing is sent to relieve you. 

That's all. Easy enough, right? Good luck, pilots. "

7727, "Tactical Arbiter Jesper Thynne:
It's good to have you back, pilots. I sincerely apologize for the deception. I am sure some of you are concerned about what has happened and how your first two sorties as Direwolves turned out to be a political fiasco and an anti-terrorist operation instead of simple dogfights against the Shivans. 

I wish we could have told you the truth up front, but the Fleetmaster gave me strict orders to assign a fighter wing to this operation without alerting the entire fleet that a liner had been hijacked. I had no choice.

Wingmaster Gibson, I would like to personally congratulate you on your valiant actions during the mission. You remained calm and focused when eliminating the renegades, negotiating with terrorists, and ensuring the safety of the Nassau after Shivan warships turned up. Your quick thinking helped to prevent the hijackers from succeeding. You are indeed a credit to your uniform and an example for your men. 

I must, however, insist that you and your wingmen are not to discuss this mission with anyone. The truth getting out would damage morale and the stability of the fleet. If anyone asks, you had a quiet, uneventful patrol today. 

As for the hijackers, the majority of them were killed by the Roaming Fleet's marines. A few survivors were captured and are now awaiting their interrogation. Shipmaster Hartwick is determined to find out who is responsible for this attack, and if Hartwick is determined, that means it's only a matter of time until we learn the truth."

7728, "Today's outcome was disastrous. Soon after you launched, the Ironclad faced an overwhelming Shivan bomber attack and was destroyed. Except for a few people who managed to get to the escape pods, almost the entire crew was lost.

What's worse, the loss of the Ironclad means the end of our blockade. Shivan forces are pouring into Cor Caroli. We must continue moving the fleet to Delta Lacertae, but our breathing room is completely gone. The situation is dire."

7729, "The anti-terrorist operation to retrieve the Nassau ended in failure. The marine transport was destroyed before it could dock with the Nassau, compromising the entire mission. "

7730, "The anti-terrorist operation to retrieve the Nassau ended in failure. Beta wing was unable to disable the hijacked ship in time to prevent it from departing. As a result, the liner has disappeared without a trace. 
	
	We are focusing our efforts on discovering its location, but this is a devastating setback. The Nassau had hundreds of innocent civilians on board as well as precious cargo that we sought to retrieve. Finding it in an uncharted system will be a difficult task. "

7731, "The anti-terrorist effort to retrieve the Nassau was successful, but the primary objective ended in failure. After our boarding party secured the liner, the hijackers released all available escape pods and transports packed with hostages. 
	
	One transport contained precious cargo whose retrieval was critical. However, Beta wing was unable to identify and disable the transport before it departed the area.
	
	The rescue of the Nassau is a victory, but the loss of the cargo is a devastating loss. All available resources will be devoted to finding the cargo and the terrorists who escaped with it. "

7732, "Good job disabling all of the transports that were launched while our marines were retaking the Nassau. The remaining three transports were full of civilians who had been taken hostage by the terrorists. By securing those transports, you saved our rescue teams a lot of work and let them focus on locating the numerous escape pods. "

7733, "Get some rest while you can, pilots. The fleet's journey to Delta Lacertae is proceeding as planned, but we may need to call you back to duty if an emergency arises."

7771, "All enemy forces have been destroyed, Ironclad. We are awaiting the coordinates of the convoy. "

7772, "Beta wing, the coordinates have been sent to your fighters. You are already late, so please hurry. It won't be long before more Shivans track down our convoys."

7773, "Roger that, Ironclad. We are preparing to jump now."

7774, "Here we go! "

7775, "Beta wing, this entry vector will put you some distance away from your destination. That will give us time to brief you on your objective. "

7776, "What? We were briefed before launch. "

7777, " We made up a false briefing for a routine escort mission, pilot. All of the other pilots think you are going to protect civilian convoys."

7778, "...So that was a lie. Okay, Ironclad, what's our real mission?"

7779, "One of the liners from the Colony Fleet, the ORLr Nassau, has gone dark. We know its exit vector, but it's not responding to our calls or sending a distress signal. Its comm systems are down. We believe it might have been hijacked. "

7780, "Hijacked? It's not an Elysium transport, it's a Hestia-class star liner. It would take a lot more than a bunch of mercs to hijack a ship that big."

7781, "We're aware of that, Beta 1, so proceed cautiously. Four Encantona fighters are escorting the Nassau. We're guessing they're mercs. Expect them to be hostile. "

7782, "Your first objective is to eliminate these fighters. Do not respond to any of their hails. They are to be considered traitors. Once that's done, disable the Nassau. You won't have much time before the ship departs. "

7783, "When the Nassau is secured, Omega 1 will jump in to retake the liner. Cover the transport in case any more terrorists show up. Any questions?"

7784, "Destroy escort, smash engines, cover the marines. Consider it done, Ironclad."

7785, "Good to hear, Beta 1. Remember, we need the Nassau and its cargo in one piece. We are depending on you, Beta wing. Godspeed, pilots."

7786, "I don't like this at all. We're being dragged into something ugly here. "

7787, "What is it, Echo? Scared of a few mercs? If they're hijacking ships for ransom while Shivans are around, we'll be doing the fleet a favor by killing them. "

7788, "I agree with Echo. It's definitely something more than hijacking for ransom. But our orders are clear. Remember, do not hesitate. If you don't pull the trigger, they will. They may be ORS, but we've been clearly instructed to destroy them. Are we clear? "

7789, "Yes, sir. "

7790, "Good. Get ready--we're almost there. "

7791, "Ironclad, we're in position. I have a visual on the Nassau and the escort fighters."

7792, "They're breaking to attack! Definitely hostile! "

7793, "Take 'em out! Secure the area! "

7794, "These Encantona profiles are thin... I'm firing at them and keep missing! Now I see how we survived the last fight with the Shivans with almost no armor at all!"

7795, "That's all of 'em. That wasn't so tough... "

7796, "The Nassau is charging its subspace drive! Beta wing, arm your Defilers and take out the engines!"

7797, "Ironclad control, this is Beta 1. The Nassau is disabled and the escort fighters have been destroyed. You can deploy the boarding party at any time. "

7798, "Well done, Beta. Omega 1 is on its way. Protect the transport until it docks with Nassau. "

7799, "Copy that, Ironclad."

7800, "This is Omega 1. Beta, form up on us and provide escort. "

7801, "Omega 1, stand down. We have locked 5,000 people in their quarters.  If you try to dock, we will begin shutting down life support to those sections."

7802, "Well, that complicates things... "

7803, "All Syndicate units, do not approach us. We demand time to repair our jump drive. You will grant us safe passage to Delta Lacertae. When our business is done, we will return the Nassau with all hostages safe and sound. "

7804, "Do you seriously think the ORS will negotiate with terrorists? I'll give you only one chance to surrender, you worthless scum. I suggest you take it. "

7805, " You should've taken our threats seriously, Omega 1. I have already cut off life support to the first residential compartment. Sixty-nine people were inside. Their deaths are on your hands. Come any closer and more innocents will die."

7806, "Very well... Standing down. We will give you time to bring your jump drive back online and... "

7807, "The Nassau is moving! We'd better hurry! It'll get away if we don't destroy the engines soon! "

7808, "Heads up! We've got visitors!"

7809, "Shivan bombers are attacking the Nassau! We're heavily outnumbered! We won't stop them without reinforcements!"

7810, "Omega 1 is jumping out of here... Where the hell are they going?"

7811, "ORS pilots, listen to me! We know you came here to retrieve the Mastermind. If you don't help us, it will be lost for good! "

7812, "Mastermind? What the fuck are you-- "

7813, "You're right, Nassau. We're here for the Mastermind. And we both know you need our help to get your traitorous asses out of this mess. We'll cover you for now, but you'd better not do anything stupid. "

7814, "Ironclad, this is Beta 1. We're in trouble. The Nassau's been hijacked. They've got civilian hostages. Strong Shivan presence in the area. Omega 1 just crash-jumped. We need reinforcements now! "

7815, "We copy, Beta. Protect the Nassau at all costs! We are dispatching reinforcements to aid you."

7816, "Shivan cruiser with escort has just arrived! "

7817, "This is the ORFg Halifax. All cannons, target the Shivan cruiser and fire at will! Let's teach them some humility. "

7818, "Oh, it's Shipmaster Hartwick again. Aren't we lucky?  "

7819, "More Shivan bombers are inbound. Beta wing, move to intercept."

7820, "Wait, check the Nassau! They're preparing to jump! "

7821, "All fighters, ignore all other targets and disable the Nassau! Target its engines and concentrate your fire! I want that ship disabled NOW!"

7822, "What are they doing!? There are still civilians on board! They'll be executed if we attack the Nassau!"

7823, "The Nassau is disabled again. They'll have a hard time repairing their jump drives a second time. "

7824, "ORS forces, I say again, stay away from the Nassau or we will execute the remaining civilians! You have ten seconds to withdraw! "

7825, "I do not negotiate with terrorists. "

7826, "Omega 1 in position. We are proceeding to dock with Nassau. "

7827, "Beta wing, protect Omega 1 while it docks with the Nassau."

7828, "Don't be stupid, Halifax! You are sending thousands of innocent civilians to hell! Turn back the transport now! "

7829, "I guess negotiations are over. They want this Mastermind back, whatever it is, no matter how many innocent lives it costs!"

7830, "Teams Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie in position.  Secure the airlock and move out!"

7831, "I'm detecting a power spike in the Nassau's primary reactor! The entire ship will blow if they don't stop it!"

7832, "ORS forces, stand down! We cut off life support to two more compartments! That's 180 more dead civilians! Call off your marines or we WILL kill the rest!"

7833, "Team Bravo here. We're at the primary reactor. Four tangos down, one committed suicide before we could get him. We are aborting the core overload now."

7834, "Team Charlie here. Residential section secure, no resistance here. The hijackers cut off life support to seven compartments. We count at least 800 casualties."

7835, "This is Team Alpha. We secured the bridge. No sign of hostiles. No sign of the cargo either. Awaiting mission update. "

7836, "We've got multiple launches from the hangar bay! Lots of escape pods! And two... three... no, four Elysium transports!"

7837, "Eight hundred? God, these hijackers are total savages. I hope the marines take some of them alive and make them pay for this butchery. "

7838, "Multiple life signs on those escape pods! They're packed with hostages!"

7839, "Beta, ignore the pods--they're just decoys! We are transmitting to you the signature of the cargo we're seeking. Scan the transports and locate it before they depart!"

7840, "We can't scan the transports! They're jamming our sensors! And we don't have time to disable them all!"

7841, "<SECURE TRANSMISSION> This is our location. We have marked the transport on your HUD. Disable it now so that we are not captured. "

7842, "What the hell?! Who sent that transmission?! "

7843, "I don't know, but we've got our transport! Disable it now! "

7844, "Hallifax, this is Beta 1. The transport carrying the special cargo has been disabled."

7845, "Well done, Beta. Most impressive. We are assembling another boarding party now. "

7846, "Halifax, what about the civilians in the pods? They've just been sent into the middle of nowhere!"

7847, "Don't concern yourself with them, pilot. We will dispatch rescue teams to pick them up as soon as the cargo is secure."

7848, "This is Delta team. All hostiles neutralized. The package has been secured. We can now jump back to the Ironclad."

7849, "Very well, Delta. Beta, your job here is done. Jump with Omega 2 and return to the Ironclad for debriefing. We will finish mopping up here. Engineer teams are already on the way to repair the Nassau's jump drive. We'll oversee the retrieval of the civilians as well."

Welcome, pilots. We don't have much time, so I'll keep this brief. The $G Colony $G Fleet is still crossing the portal to $B Delta $B Lacertae. More than 85 percent of our ships have already made it, so we expect the entire fleet to be on the other side in a matter of hours. Shivan attempts to break through the blockade are intensifying, so we must withdraw from $B Cor $B Caroli as soon as possible. "

7870, "In the meantime, our factory ships are still mining minerals from several asteroid fields within the $B Cor $B Caroli system. These minerals will allow us to produce new fighters and repair damage to our warships even while the fleet is on the move. We don't know when we'll have another chance to replenish our stocks, so it is essential for our mining sites to remain operational as long as we have the means to protect them."

7871, "Beta wing, you will be deployed to assist the $G Ida $G Lewis. The factory ship has just finished mining minerals from an asteroid field not far from $B Cor $B Caroli $B 6, a large gas giant. However, as it was preparing to depart, it came under attack from Shivan bomber wings and its engines were damaged. We need to deploy a transport with an engineering team to carry out repairs. Your mission is to cover the transport and the Ida Lewis until the factory ship is ready to depart."

7872, "Shivan reavers"

7873, "Nice job rescuing our factory ship, Beta wing. You handled it well--better than the rookies sent here before you. They screwed up royally.

Losing the Ida Lewis would have been a devastating blow to the Fleet, especially now."

7874, "Nice job rescuing our factory ship, Beta wing. You handled it well--better than the rookies sent here before you.

You arrived just in time to save her. Losing the Ida Lewis would have been a devastating blow to the Fleet, especially now."

7875, "Thanks to your efforts, we have plenty of minerals to meet our industrial needs. These minerals will now be processed and forged into metal alloys, which in turn shall be a resource to produce new fighters, weaponry, and ammo for our ships. This is a major boost for our economic capabilities. With luck, soon you'll see the benefit yourselves in the form of newly available weapons and ships for your sorties."

7876, "Your efforts to save the Ida Lewis from Shivan attacks were not enough, and the mining ship was blown up by enemy bomber strikes. This is a devastating blow our economy.  In a matter of minutes, we've lost both our primary factory ship and a huge stash of mineral resources that we needed to maintain the Exodus Fleet."

7877, "Your efforts to save Ida Lewis from Shivan attacks were insufficient, as the transport ship carrying the engineering team and spare parts needed to restore its jump drive was destroyed by enemy reavers. We expected better, pilots. It was one thing for those rookies to screw up, but a veteran wing such as yours should have been able to get the job done. "

7924, "$B Shipmaster $B Lehrman: 
Pilots, we have an emergency. The Shivan armada is ruthlessly assaulting our blockade at the Naos jump node. The $G Ironclad and its fleet are barely holding their positions, but it won't be long before they are overrun if they do not receive reinforcements. As the $G Colony $G Fleet is still moving to $B Delta $B Lacertae, we need to maintain the blockade longer than we initially planned. Fleetmaster Tyrone has called all available fighters to rejoin the Ironclad. "

7925, "The $G ORFg $G Harmattan is now being deployed to reinforce the $G Ironclad. The Federate frigate $G Andrasta will also assist you. Your objective is to support these two frigates as they carry out a flank attack on the Shivans currently engaging Fleetmaster Tyrone's forces. After that, cover the $G Ironclad's retreat and hold the blockade until further reinforcements can be deployed. Good luck. "

7926, "Tactical Arbiter Thynne:
Good to see you safe and sound, pilots. Our operation to patch the hole in our defenses did not go as planned, but the Harmattan and Andrasta successfully cleared a path for the Ironclad to withdraw. 

Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. Until now, we had fought only auxiliary Shivan forces. Now it seems clear that our enemy has deployed a full-scale fleet to hunt us down. And the SJ Tyrant, the Shivan juggernaut that appeared in Cor Caroli, is its flagship. 

We've feared the Tyrant's reappearance ever since we left Sol, and we have no time to waste. Since most of the Colony Fleet has already made it to Delta Lacertae, the Ironclad and its battlegroup will head for the jump node immediately. We need to reach Delta Lacertae quickly before the Shivan pursuit can overwhelm us. Get ready, pilots. It'll take everything we have for us to make it out of the system. "

7927, "Our swift strike against the Shivan forces ended in disaster. The enemy ignored the Harmattan and Andrasta and focused on their primary target, the Ironclad. The Ironclad was lost with all hands, including Fleetmaster Tyrone."

7928, "Our reinforcements deployed to relieve the Ironclad on the blockade were unable to hold off the enemy long enough to buy the rest of the fleet time to withdraw. As a result, the Shivans broke through our defenses and attacked many Colony Fleet ships. Our civilian population took heavy losses today."

7990, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne:
Pilots, we're facing a difficult situation. As you know, Shivan forces have broken our blockade of the $B Naos jump node and are moving further into $B Cor $B Caroli as we speak. The $R Tyrant remains near the Naos jump node, but a large number of Shivan warships are scouring the system in search of any $G Syndicate warships. The $G Ironclad's battle group was preparing to head to $B Delta $B Lacertae, but the Shivans were one step ahead of us. A large Shivan battlegroup led by the $R SD $R Chaya, a Ravana-class destroyer, has seized control over the $B Delta $B Lacertae jump node and is blocking our only escape path. 

Until we break that blockade, we are cut off from the rest of the fleet and trapped in $B Cor $B Caroli with the Shivans."

7991, "Shivan blockade"

7992, "The Ironclad's battlegroup is not in good shape. Most of the ships, including the Ironclad itself, took heavy damage in the engagement with Shivan forces at the Naos jump node. We simply don't have the strength to attempt a full-scale assault on the $R Chaya and the other Shivan warships at the Delta Lacertae jump node. 

What's more, we have a couple of laggards from the $G Colony $G Fleet who did not reach $B Delta $B Lacertae before the Shivans secured the node. We cannot leave these civilians vulnerable."

7993, "Ironclad battlegroup"

7994, "Colony Fleet marauders"

7995, "For these reasons, before the $G Ironclad can be deployed, we need to soften the Shivan defenses with an artillery strike. The $G ORFA $G Akka and $G ORFA $G Vijayawada will attack the blockade from a distance with a simple objective: mess things up as much as possible. The long range of their main railguns will allow the Akka and the Vijayawada to inflict severe damage on enemy warships before they can close to return fire. 
 
 Once the frigates are in position, the Shivans will no doubt launch bomber strikes against them. $G Alpha and $G Beta wings will assist the frigates and do whatever it takes to repel these strikes. We cannot risk sending in the Ironclad until the Shivan forces are weakened, so we need to buy time for the $G Akka and $G Vijayawada to chip away at their defenses."

7996, "Vijayawada"

7997, "Once the Shivan defenses are softened enough, the $G Ironclad and our remaining warships, together with the civilian vessels, will enter the field of engagement and fight their way through the Shivan lines. $G Sword wing from the $G EFFg $G Andrasta will be held as backup and deployed alongside the Ironclad, or earlier if the Fleetmaster decides we need additional fighter cover. All fighter wings must protect our forces as they make their way to $B Delta $B Lacertae."

Alright, Direwolves, listen up! The $G Ironclad has just arrived in $B Delta $B Lacertae, but don't let that make you feel too comfortable - we're not staying here any longer than necessary. Fleetmaster Caliphtys has already secured the $B Terminus system and the $G Colony $G Fleet is now on its way there. The $G Ironclad is heavily damaged after a narrow escape from $B Cor $B Caroli, so it will head straight for $B Terminus where it will pay a short visit to the Big Buddha. But don't worry, you won’t be getting a vacation from the battle in Delta Lacertae. We would never do such a thing to you. We are deploying you to support the blockade of the $B Cor $B Caroli jump node."

8062, "Command over the blockade of $B Cor $B Caroli jump node was given to $w Fleetmaster $w Aasira $w Raji, the Heavy Fleet's commanding officer. Fleetmaster Raji is determined to slow down Shivan progress long enough to evacuate $G Colony $G Fleet away from the war zone. The Battle of Cor Caroli was hard on us because the majority of the Fleet was tied down defending the civilian ships and therefore our offensive capabilities were significantly limited. We will not make the same mistake again. The greater distance we can put between the Shivans and the Colony Fleet, the more warships we can spare to send on the offensive. We plan to maintain our perimeter here until all the civilians are safe in the $B Terminus system."

8063, "In your next assignment Beta wing will pilot $y ORB $y Krios light bombers. You already saw the Krios in combat. It is assembled in our factory ships using the Claymore fighter as a base. Unlike our Stalker medium bombers, the Krios cannot be produced from raw materials mined from asteroids. Nevertheless, it is still a major step forward in our effort to provide the fleet with the capability replace destroyed fighters and bombers. "

8064, "The standard missile used by the Krios is the $y ORM $y Chrabaszcz, wih its fast and accurate swarm-type warhead. Today's engagment will be is the first combat use of this weapon. As the $G Anjaneya will require bomber support to repel the upcoming Shivan assault, Command views this as a suitable moment for the first combat test for the Chrabaszcz. Its major improvement when compared to traditional warheads is that you don't need to approach the target and dive. The missile is very difficult to shoot down, so just get in range, lock, fire and forget. "

8158, "... your curiosity will remain unsatisfied. Both the inner structure of the Valkyries and Fleetmaster Raji's beliefs are none of your business. Sorry, I know your kind. You pretend to be curious and try to find a way to get involved with one of us. Not gonna happen."

8159, "Wait! No! I just wanted to know more about you. I didn't want go that far just now, but..."

8161, "Go easy on him, squadmaster. Perhaps the mistake is mine. Anyway, I know what you're getting at, Fives. The answer is no. We're not Wargods. We like men, but actually we prefer hunting the Shivans."

8162, "A real warrior knows when to rest. Perhaps I underestimated you earlier, Fives. Remind me not to piss you off. "

Alright, people, time for a brief situation report. The$R Cyaegha is in $B Delta $B Lacertae and has already reached the first rendezvous point. We've got a factory ship, two liners and many other units there, all currently recharging jump drives and unable to depart. Two Vitalius frigates - the $G Sharur and the $G Lenus - are providing cover for the convoy. However, they do not stand a chance against an undamaged Samael-class destroyer. "

8178, "You know what we have to do. We need to engage the $R Cyaegha. Spark, you and $G Beta will lead a bomber strike. Your objective is to destroy the $R Cyaegha's forward beam cannons and her engines. $G Alpha and $G Gamma from the Redemption will clear the way for you. We will attempt to lure away the Shivan fighter cover so that you can attack the destroyer untroubled. "

8179, "Gamma"

8180, "For now, no reinforcements are available. There is no backup. We will be on our own, outnumbered, overwhelmed. Many of you will find death here. But we must do it! Innocent people are being slaughtered as we speak! If we do not reach the convoy on time, they will all be lost. We will not fall back. We will hunt that bastard down and hit it with everything we've got. 

That's all. Let's do it, Direwolves! If you have ever wanted to die a hero, today is a good day. "

8181, "Welcome to Anjaneya, Direwolves. And congratulations on your outstanding performance. Squadmaster Harper, you made the difficult decision to attack the Cyaegha without logistical support. You confronted an enemy far more powerful than you. You fought wave after wave of Shivan fighters. And yet, despite these challenges, you survived and you prevailed. 

Your valiant effort today saved thousands of lives. If you had not distracted the Cyaegha and her fighters, none of the civilians would have survived to tell the tale. The shipmasters of the remaining civilian units have sent words of gratitude on behalf of themselves and their passengers. You have my gratitude, as well. I know that this victory comes at a great cost. Your squadron was hit hard during the assault. We mourn every single pilot who gave their life to protect the innocent. They will be remembered. 

Unfortunately, this is not the end of our struggle. The Anjaneya and Redemption are maintaining the blockade and will continue to do so as long as necessary. Since the Colony Fleet is still on the way to the jump node, we will soon need to cover their retreat and then follow them through the node. Prepare yourselves well, Direwolves. "

8182, "Harper: 
We failed. Despite your efforts, the Cyaegha has escaped and is now on the way to another rendezvous point.

You confronted an enemy far more powerful than you. Despite your great efforts, the enemy escaped and attacked another of the Colony Fleet's rendezvous points. We feel obliged to inform you that there are no survivors from the Cyaegha's attack. More than 20 thousand people were killed in its onslaught. 

Despite these tragic losses, we can still claim a victory, albeit a Pyrrhic one. Your aggressive strike against the Cyaegha saved lots of lives from the previous convoy it was trying to attack. If you had not distracted the Cyaegha and its fighters, none of the convoy's civilians would have survived.

Greetings, Direwolves. I hope you slept well and found your quarters comfortable. As you know you have been temporarily assigned to the $G Anjaneya while the Ironclad is undergoing repairs at the $B Big $B Buddha shipyard in $B Terminus. It was Fleetmaster Raji's wish that pilots from the Ironclad have all the comforts they need while they prepare for their next sortie.  "

8280, "After a long and... well, emotional talk with your squadmaster I agreed to grant you access to two wings of $y Heretic interceptors. These latest-gen fighters are the fastest ships in the Fleet, combining high acceleration and top speed with considerable firepower. I was reluctant to give these fighters to you because we are still unable to produce any more of them on our factory ships. Therefore we have only a limited number of Heretics assembled before the Exodus. Try not to scratch them too much, pilots. "

8281, "You have also been granted access to the $y Polyhydra, a versatile short-range assault cannon with powerful splash damage against both armor and shields. I suggest that you configure your primary weapon set with a Polyhydra on the first bank and  an anti-subsystem weapon such as the Pulsar on the second. "

8282, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Trissia $B Vandervort: 
Listen up, Direwolves, we're short on time here! Before it was destroyed, the $R Cyaegha managed to deploy multiple wings of reavers which are harassing the $B Colony $B Fleet as we speak. These fighters and bombers have no base of operations, but they are still dangerous as long as they are not out of ammo and fuel. For that reason the majority of the $B Heavy $B Fleet is engaged in protecting refugee convoys. That means we are all going to have our hands full. "

8283, "You surely remember that five days ago back in $B Cor $B Caroli you were deployed to investigate a signal sent from the $B N476 nebula. You found out that it was a Federate cruiser, the $B Minerva, that detached from the Fleet. It was fitted with an emitter of an unknown type of waves that lured nearby Shivan forces to its position. Thanks to your efforts, Syndicate forces successfully retrieved the cruiser and the emitter, despite considerable Shivan resistance and also a Federation frigate, the $R Midwinter, trying to cross our plans. 

Well, we have just received this signal again. Here, in Delta Lacertae. "

8284, "To be precise, this time there are several different signal locations. All were activated simultaneously and all come from an asteroid belt surrounding a rocky planet $B Delta $B Lacertae $B III. We have analyzed the signal's frequencies and they match those which the Ironclad received in $B Cor $B Caroli. We've got to retrieve whatever is emitting this signal without delay."

8285, "Signal sources"

8286, "Federation presence?"

8287, "Shivan presence in the asteroid belt is strong, consisting of reavers deployed by the $R Cyaegha. They are patrolling the area in a disorganized manner, but they are largely concentrated in areas matching the origins of these signals. 

It is possible that intrigues of our Federate allies did not end with the Midwinter's operation. Although $G EFN forces within the Fleet have been reorganized so that they are kept under control, we must take into account the fact that they will try to find a way to dispatch some forces without attracting our attention. 

For that reason, be careful and expect both Shivan and Federation presence. "

8288, "We are dispatching our own wings $G Theta, $G Delta and $G Epsilon, but  the Fleetmaster agreed that your experience in the previous operation will be of use here. Squadmaster Harper was reluctant to spare any forces for this operation and in the end we all agreed to dispatch $G Beta wing to one of the origin points of these signals. Each wing will operate separately, investigating a different set of coordinates corresponding to the source of a signal.

Your $B Heretic fighters have been equipped with advanced data-extracting interfaces integrated into your short-range scanners. That means we do not plan to risk sending a boarding party into the asteroid belt. You just need to scan every ship that emits the signal - your tactical computers will retrieve any readable data that may have value to us and transfer them directly to the Anjaneya. "

8292, "Tactical Arbiter Trissia Vandervort: 
This was an operation carried out by the book, Direwolves. The successful retrieval of tactical computers' data of EFN ships should allow us to finally unravel the mystery of Federate activity outside of Exodus Fleet's jurisdiction. 

Let me remind you that any intel you recovered is classified at level Epsilon. Any attempt to access the data that was transferred to the Anjaneya will be treated as a violation of the Military Secrets Act and therefore be considered treason to the Syndicate. Also, it is advisable not to discuss the unidentified EFN presence in Delta Lacertae and Cor Caroli with anyone. Believe me, the fewer secrets are being publicly discussed, the better for the Fleet's stability and safety. 

Report to the briefing room in thirty minutes. The Anjaneya is deploying all free assets to cover the Colony Fleet's evacuation to Terminus. You will soon be needed again, Direwolves. "

8370, "Anjaneya, come in. All data packets have been sent. We're awaiting further orders. "

8371, "Just in time, pilots. We just withdrew from the blockade due to heavy Shivan pressure. We need all fighters available to cover the Fleet's retreat. We are sending you our coordinates, return to the Anjaneya at once. "

8372, "Damn, these sentry guns are annoying. Why did the Shivans deploy so many of them? "

8373, "We've even got a support ship here. Poor Centaur. Let's see what we can find in it. "

8374, "Spark, I've got a partial scan of an asteroid. Definitely something inside. But I'm detecting more Shivan signatures, as well. "

8385, "For the attention of the 114th Direwolves, 

Your squadron has now access to the $y ORM $y Hurricane. It is a missile designed to harass whole wings of enemy fighters and light bombers. After launching the missile, the pilot needs to track its trajectory and detonate it when it is about 500 metres from hostile targets. Once detonated, Hurricane splits into multiple explosives which inflict heavy splash damage to shields and moderate to armor. You can use it to snipe wings of hostiles or fire it at a close distance like a shotgun. Remember, however, avoid detonating the missile when you are too close as it is easy to damage yourself when using Hurricane inappropriately.

8386, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Sheila $B Thyssea:
Direwolves, we have a new mission for you. We received a distress signal from one of our colony ships, $G ORCo $G Adrastus. An engine malfunction delayed the colony ship's escape and it found itself in one of the last convoys leaving $B Delta $B Lacertae. Unfortunately, it came under attack by Shivan warships and its primary engines, already barely operational, were damaged again. The Escort Fleet frigates $G Lexington and $G La $G Manche along with the remaining fighter wings are holding a cordon around the $G Adrastus, but they are heavily outnumbered and require immediate assistance.

You then need to clear a path for her to reach the $B Terminus jump node. Your wing will be deployed first. Your orders are to assist the $G Anjaneya in the assault and provide cover for the colony ship. "

8391, "Just in case you forget what's at stake: the $G Adrastus is home to more than 180,000 people. Most of them remain in hypersleep, locked in cryogenic chambers. If the ship goes down, almost one sixth of the Fleet's population will die with it.  It also hosts agricultural decks where synthetic food is grown for the fleet.

8475, "$B Fleetmaster $B Tyrone: 
Morning, pilots, and welcome. As you all know, we left behind Delta Lacertae and reached $B Terminus. There are two jump nodes through which the Shivans can enter the system: $B Delta $B Lacertae and $B Mi $B Arae. The Ironclad and Anjaneya are blocking these jump nodes, while Demetrius' battlegroup and part of $G Roaming $G Fleet are preparing to set off to another system - $B Messier $B 1-A, a gateway to $B Messier $B 80 star cluster. $G Colony $G Fleet is scattered throughout the system. There are no major Shivan forces left in $B Terminus, so the civilians are relatively safe for now. This moment of peace will not last long, however, so we must finish our goals here as fast as possible. "

8476, "Allow me to provide a short historical background. In the distant past $B Terminus was a binary star system. Nine planets in total orbited two massive giant stars. However, about 20,000 years ago $B Terminus $B A went supernova and destroyed six planets and everything else orbiting it. A nebula was created as a result. The remnants of $B Terminus $B A formed a black hole which soon began to absorb the rest of the system. "

8477, "$B Terminus $B B and its three planets were hit by the shockwave, but they survived. Among them there is Terminus I, an Earth-like planet closest to the star. It is unclear to us how it was possible, but it looks as if it was relatively untouched by the cataclysm. We estimate that it is a matter of four to five centuries before $B Terminus $B B and its planets are also absorbed by the black hole and subspace connections to and from the system become too unstable for travel. Nevertheless, it is the only possible route the Fleet can take so we have to make sure our ships are safe. "

8478, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne: 
Good to see most of you safe and sound, Direwolves. We missed you on the Ironclad. So, been on a small trip, huh? At least you were not bored as we were, sitting for a few days in a shipyard and doing nothing. I'm sure you look forward to getting back to the frontline, so I'll get straight to the point. 

For your next sortie you will fly with some new armaments. Courtesy of Fleetmaster Raji, the Ironclad has received $y Hurricane missiles. Pilots who accompanied the Anjaneya in Delta Lacertae have already had a chance to use this weapon, but the others are recommended to familiarize themselves with its tactical employment in the techroom. "

8479, "We have also received a gift from Big Buddha's engineers when they were patching up our armor. An advanced version of the Vortex torpedo has been recently invented and is now available for all squadrons on the Ironclad. Compared to its predecessor, the $y Vortex $y Advanced locks on more quickly, hits targets with better accuracy and has shorter reloading time. Our factory ships have already begun production and I can assure you, we'll soon have tons of these weapons to use. "

8480, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne:
The fleet is holding position in Terminus and the $G Ironclad is leading the blockade of the $R Delta $R Lacertae jump node. The system is entirely under our control, but don't get too comfortable - the Tyrant's armada is only a few steps behind us. The sooner we are ready to depart to Messier 80, the better. $G Alpha will stay with the Ironclad and protect it on the blockade, but for $G Beta we've got a different task - a calm, quiet assignment to give you some rest before the critical battle."

8481, "High Magistrate Al-Zardari wants us to examine some subspace anomalies scattered throughout the system. We need to understand the effects they have on space around them to help our navigators select a path for the fleet. The eggheads sent by Al-Zardari tell us that 'Not only $B Terminus is a unique system on the brink of collapse but also its black hole shapes subspace in ways that humankind has yet to observe. These scans will provide us with precious data for further analysis.' Well, in my humble opinion, I don't give two shits about these assholes, but we've got our orders, so let's get to work. "

8535, "Possible, but I'm not convinced. Our scientists must be conducting some kind of research here. You heard Thynne: This black hole has unique influence on subspace network. Maybe they're preparing to test a new drive... or something? No idea. "

8536, "Hey! I still have the signatures of those anomalies. Just have a look! They're all similar. The same pattern... but different sizes. If I had time, I could compare them to known signatures from ORS database. "

8540, "You know, Echo, now when you mention it... did you notice that Demetrius is still in Terminus along with our Vanguard? They have always been one system ahead from Colony Fleet, clearing the path. "

8541, "Something made the fleetmasters halt our progress. The question is what? Did we get lost? "

8542, "I don't know. I think we'll have to wait for our debriefing. But I don't like this at all."

8543, "Good job, pilots. Stand by. In a moment we will send you new coordinates. "

8545, "Fives, this is not the right time to... "

8546, "We have some research to do in Terminus while we are prepare the fleet for our move to Messier 80. There is no reason for you to worry about that, pilot. "

8547, "I think there is. You're hiding something from us. There's some trouble along the way, isn't there? "

8548, "The purpose of this data analysis is classified, pilot. I must insist that you let our scientific teams do their jobs and you focus on doing yours. "

8549, "My wingman is right. There have been... complications, right? Fleetmaster Caliphtys is still here. Our vanguard is still here. Colony Fleet has not even started moving to Messier 80. And you are sending fighters to scour the system in search of... subspace anomalies? "

8550, "How's this for the truth, Vigilant Eye control? You didn't find a jump node to Messier 80, right? Fleetmasters led us here and now we are trapped, besieged by the Tyrant's armada with no hope for escape."

8551, "I cannot confirm that, wingmaster. I just... "

8552, "What do you mean, no jump node!? We have nowhere to go? It... it can't be! "

8553, "Alright, now we know what's going on. Just send us those stupid coordinates. "

8554, "If we don't find the jump node... what will happen to us? Can we fight our way to another node? "

8555, "Silence! You are correct. We didn't find a jump node to Messier 80. To be specific, at its coordinates we found a node, but it was collapsed, completely unusable. We are searching the sector hoping that the proper node was affected by the black hole and lies elsewhere in the system. "

8556, "I know how it looks, but we need you to keep quiet about this. We must avoid a panic in the fleet. Proceed with your duties. We will find a way, I assure you. "

8557, "Or at least you hope you will. But what if the jump node is permanently collapsed? What if it was absorbed by the black hole? Do you have a backup plan in case we... "

8558, "Attention all units! You have to return to the Ironclad at once! A large Shivan battlegroup has broken our blockade and is about to attack the Colony Fleet! "

It was a difficult day for the fleet, pilots. We lost many good people. But we held the line. And we prevailed. 

We have won the battle, although this victory has cost us dearly. We could have done little to minimize our casualties.

The frigates which reinforced our warships in the turning point of the battle - Adamantium, Unobtanium and Vibranium, belong to the Black Operations Department, which is the covert strike force of the ORS. I have no idea how they found themselves in Terminus, but they are definitely on our side here. 

You should expect more information about our mysterious allies soon, but for now get some rest. This was not the last battle. And it definitely was not the most costly one. We still have a Shivan armada at the door and they are not going to let us leave without a fight. "

8580, "It was a difficult day for the fleet, pilots. We lost many good people. We also lost the Ironclad. We did not hold the line. 

There was simply too many of them. The Shivan offensive broke our defence and left the Colony Fleet defenseless against the enemy. We made thw mistake of underestimating our adversary and innocents paid a terrible price for our hubris. "

Attention, Direwolves! Here's your new mission. Fleetmaster Tyrone has chosen to send you to the nebula surrounding the Terminus black hole to locate and rescue Fleetmaster Tessandras' flagship the $G BOD-D $G Vermillion. The Vermillion, along with three frigates that reinforced us in the battle over Terminus II, are part of the $G ORS $G Black $G Operations $G Department, a covert unit created at the beginning of the second EFN war. It was presumed that the $G Vermillion and its battlegroup were destroyed in Beta Volantis trying to buy Fleetmaster Glenzmann time to shut down the jump node. It turns out they survived and escaped the Shivans just as we did. "

8719, "I can't say I know what Fleetmaster Tessandras is doing out here. Nonetheless, we have orders to find him and escort his flagship to safety. As far as we know, Vermillion was hiding in the nebula, close to the black hole's event horizon. It was attacked by the Shivans and its primary core was smashed. Fleetmaster Tyrone dispatched an engineering team that will transport a new core to the Vermillion and install it so that the destroyer can join the Exodus Fleet. "

8720, "Your first objective is to reach the Vermillion's position and contact Fleetmaster Tessandras. When you confirm the area is safe, we will send $G Lambda $G 1. You must protect it until it docks with the Vermillion and then until repairs are completed. As soon as the destroyer is ready to depart, you will assist it to the rendezvous and then follow the rest of the fleet to $B Mi $B Arae. Colony Fleet has already begun moving to $B Mi $B Arae, so do not waste time. The sooner we leave Terminus, the better. "

8721, "Remember that the nebula itself is being pulled into the black hole. You will be a safe distance from its event horizon, but this is still a dangerous mission. The nebula has very unstable weather conditions and is regularly torn apart by magnetic storms. Your sensor usage will be limited, so you have to rely on one another and stay together. 

Good luck, pilots. "

A job well done, Direwolves. This was a masterfully performed rescue operation. You located the Vermillion and protected it while repairs were being carried out. The large complement of bombers that attacked the BOD flagship could have inflicted substantial damage and made our engineers' job much more difficult. Fleetmaster Tessandras has sent his thanks to your squadron. He has expressed the opinion that you were exactly the men ORS needs in its most difficult operations. You have made a good impression, pilots. I am sure it will bear fruit in the future. 

For now, however, you're needed on the Ironclad. Take some rest, but expect another sortie soon. Fleetmaster Raji still holds a perimeter near the Mi Arae jump node and we are about to leave Terminus. "

8769, "The war is over, pilot. And both sides have lost. I believe your fleetmasters came to the same conclusion as I did: that we must work with the Federates. I needed their supplies. They needed my knowledge of the system. So we joined forces. "

8799, "These coordinates come by way of Fleetmaster Tessandras. When he first arrived in Terminus, his scouts located a large structure of alien origin. It was christened the $B Malia. It does not resemble anything we have yet encountered. Thanks to the strong Shivan presence in Terminus at that time, research teams from BOD were unable to examine the structure. They were able to conclude, however, that it is of neither Terran, Vasudan nor Shivan construction.

Good job securing the subspace portal, Direwolves. I think you will be glad to hear about Shipmaster Hartwick's success. By the time you landed on Ironclad the probe has collected all scans and confirmed that the other side of the portal is free of the Shivans. You all know what that means - if we shut down the Malia after the fleet crosses it, we will cut ourselves off from the Shivan armada. 

Following Shipmaster Hartwick's operation of securing the Malia, fleetmasters turned the fleet back and directed it straight to the subspace portal. However, the Shivans are still pressing us hard, so we must escort all ships to safety as soon as possible. Fleetmaster Tyrone has received orders to launch a series of counter strikes to keep the Shivans occupied while the Colony Fleet is on its way to Malia. 

Expect another sortie in no time, pilots. No one's gonna win this war for us. "

We regret the death of Shipmaster Hartwick, a brilliant commander and a true patriot who did not hesitate from anything to keep the Syndicate safe. We will be kept in our memory in... eh, damn it. I'm fed up with formalities. Hartwick was a fucking asshole. But still he was exactly the man we needed to get the toughest job done. Tyrone's in need of a new puppet now.

8828, "Scanning has been completed. The Chania is abandoned, but the majority of the ship has sustained only moderate damage. It should be possible for a boarding party to enter the vessel, but I advise caution, as it is not clear whether... "

8829, "Your objections have been noted, doctor. I am dispatching a boarding party now. "

8830, "Incoming jump signatures! Shivan fighters inbound! Hold the boarding party launch!"

8831, "Negative, doctor. We have no time for delay. The boarding operation will proceed. Escort fighters, protect the ORT Intruder at all costs when it arrives. We cannot afford to lose this science team. "

8832, "ORT Intruder is reporting in. We are commencing docking procedure with the Chania. "

8833, "This is the Intruder. We have reached Chania's docking point. The entrance is open. We are entering the ship now. "

8834, "The entrance is open... What a pleasant coincidence. That usually means a trap. "

8835, "I hope it's not one this time. "

8836, "Shipmaster, I have compared the scans of the Chania and Malia with records from our database. There is only one pattern among all alien structures we have ever encountered that matches their construction. It comes from the final stage of the Great War. Vasudan scientists found it at an excavation in Altair and... "

8837, "I know. Both the portal and the warship were built by the Ancients. "

8838, "Shipmaster Hartwick, I have just lost contact with my scientists on board the Chania. The last message indicated your men have forbidden them to enter the ship and confiscated all their equipment! I demand an explanation! "

8839, "Science teams from the BOD have already scanned the ship. Your scientists have done well as a cover for us. Their job is finished for now. If they don't do anything stupid, none of them will get hurt. I don't need your team's help, doctor. I know exactly what we are looking for. "

8840, "We have located the terminal, sir. It is heavily encrypted. "

8841, "Connect a transceiver to the terminal and activate it. "

8842, "Acknowledged, sir. The connection will be ready in a few minutes, but we don't have a precise ETA. We have also located an unencrypted terminal from which we can activate Chania's turrets. "

8843, "More Shivan fighters have arrived. Alpha, Beta, take them down!"

8844, "We've got some bombers with escort jumping in! Destroy them first! "

8845, "Good work. Shivan forces are no longer a threat. "

8846, "Shipmaster Hartwick, the connection is established. You may begin decryption any time. "

8847, "Something's not right here. Hartwick is acting like he already knew the ship. How are they going to access the terminal? We don't know the technology. We don't know the language. We don't know their security systems. "

8848, "We don't. But there is something in the fleet that knows. We saved that thing by accident not so long ago. "

8849, "You're right, Echo! They must be using Mastermind! "

8850, "What the fuck is Mastermind?"

8851, "Long story, squadmaster. As you said to Fleetmaster Tessandras, there are things it's better to keep secret for your own good. "

8852, "We have access to the terminal now. We are activating the Malia. "

8853, "My God! The activity of the Malia is rising exponentially! I have no idea how you did it, shipmaster, but you activated the portal! "

8854, "It is not over yet. We will send a probe through the portal to see what lies on the other side. Alpha wing, you will stay with us. Beta, you will form around the probe when it arrives and escort it to the portal. "

8855, "The probe has arrived. Beta, approach it now. "

8856, "Roger that, shipmaster, we're on it. "

8857, "Watch out, Shivan fighters are approaching the probe!"

8858, "Take them down! Don't let them get too close! "

8859, "Mission accomplished, Halifax. The probe has departed. "

8860, "Finish off the remaining hostiles and return to formation, Beta. We will await a signal from the probe. "

8861, "We have received a transmission from the probe. Space behind the portal is safe and scans detected no trace of Shivan activity nearby. "

8862, "I won't report the good news to the fleetmasters until we receive  a full scan of the system. The Halifax will remain here and guard the portal. Vigilant Eye, keep scanning the area. "

8863, "This is Gamma and Delta wings, 77th Stormborns. Alpha and Beta, you are relieved. Return to the Ironclad. "

8864, "This is the Halifax! Shivan forces are focusing their attack on us. Escort fighters, tighten your defence!"

8865, "They're hitting us hard! Beta, help us out now! "

8866, "They're attacking the transport ship! Take them down, now! "

8867, "They destroyed the Halifax! Fuck!"

8868, "We have lost the Vigilant Eye! Abort the mission!"

8869, "Damn! They've taken down the Intruder! "

8870, "That can give us an advantage. Access this terminal first. Activate all available turrets. "

8871, "Mission failed. 

The Halifax has been destroyed"

8872, "Mission failed. 

The Intruder has been destroyed"

8873, "Mission failed. 

You've lost the probe.

 What? You really think ORS has nothing else to do but spend resources on extra probes just because you're a lazy asshole? Fuck off and replay the damn mission!"

8874, "Wow! Just look! See all those seas and forests down there? This world could be a true paradise! "

8875, "True. I guess we could make this place our home. You know, stay here, build new colonies, have a fresh start... "

8876, "In case you forgot, people, there's a huge Shivan armada one step behind us. If they catch us on the planet's surface, they will fucking glass it in a blink of an eye. "

8877, "And even if the Shivans don't do the job, this huge motherfucking black hole will. So don't get delusional on me, pilots. Space is now our home. It's probably always gonna be our home. "

8878, "You might be right, sir. But what could give us strength to continue this struggle if not hope that there is a home waiting for us somewhere in this cold expanse."

8879, "Huh, I think that's what I like the most about you, Spark. When things get rusty, you become a damned cold-blooded bastard, but sometimes you're a hell of a dreamer. "

8880, "I'd never left Io before the invasion. Spent my whole life on that piece of rock, under the huge domes, traveling through its sea of greyness. I always dreamt to see a real ocean on Europa... even on Mars or Earth once we'd defeated the damned Federates. "

8881, "What a bunch of fucking beautiful worlds we lost there in Sol, guys. Man begins to appreciate what he had only once it's already gone... the old story, right? "

8882, "Hmm... This might be the last habitable planet we see in our lives. How about we land down there for a moment. Just one... moment.  "

8887, "$B Fleetmaster $B Tyrone:
Welcome. Please have a seat. 

I called this briefing in order to give you a word of explanation on recent events. A lot has happened. Some of you have already realized that we had problems to locate a jump node to Messier 80. We suffered heavy losses in the last Shivan attacks, but we were able to regroup the fleet and eventually gain the upper hand. Our victory is only temporary, however, as the Shivans are bringing in more and more reinforcements to the system all the time. "

8888, "We decided to move the Fleet to $B Mi $B Arae system and take a different route than we initially chose. Then, however, we found a jump node. Or to be more specific, a subspace portal designated $B Malia. It was created by the Ancients, an extinct species. You may recall that analysis of data found in an Ancient archaeological site enabled us to destroy the Lucifer during the Great War. The Ancients have brought us hope to escape from certain death once again. $G Colony $G Fleet is now crossing the Malia, protected by $G Escort $G Fleet. $G Roaming $G Fleet must keep the Shivans occupied in order to buy the others time to escape. "

8889, "Our recent progress would have never been made if not for the help of $B Black $B Operations $B Department. It is an elite ORS strike force which has served us well since the Martian War more than 17 years ago. Many of you saw their warships reinforcing our fleet in a decisive moment at the battle of Terminus II's moon. They helped us turn the tide and they also told us about the Malia. "

8890, "You can believe me or not, but their appearance was no less a surprise to me than to you. Under Fleetmaster Lenart Tessandras they left Sol before us and managed to survive here. They remained hidden, waiting for our arrival. Now they have joined the Exodus Fleet and with their help we are going to get through the hell that surrounds us. "

8891, "We have deployed probes to scan space beyond the Malia. The portal leads to $B Andromeda, a star cluster thousands of light years away from our position. Initial scans indicate that it lies far beyond Shivan-infested space and there is no trace of our foes in that sector. You know what that means. This portal is our salvation. Once the fleet is safe on the other side, we will remotely deactivate the Malia and prevent the Shivan armada from following us through. Additionally, we will set the Ancient ship allowing us to control the portal to self-destruct as soon as the connection is shut down. 

This is our plan. We will escape to Shivan-free space and close the door behind us. We will finally get some rest. For how long - only time will tell. "

8892, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne: 
Just a few words from me before you go play heroes again. 

Fleetmaster Tessandras left us some BOD-specific equipment before he followed the fleet to Andromeda. You have now access to the $y Incisor $y Burst $y Phase $y Cannon, primary weapon for heavy and medium fighters. The Incisor fires a burst of particles that deals tremendous damage to both shielded and unshielded targets. It is deadly effective against fighters and bombers and its only disadvantage is the cooldown time required after each burst and energy consumption - believe me, big as fuck, so have a look at your ETS when firing and remember to give it time to recharge. "

8893, "The second special asset sent us from BOD with love is the $y Locust $y FFSP. Hell, I have no idea how this thing works, I didn't read the fucking manual, but it's designated to strip the shields from Shivan bombers and leave their hull wide open so that you can smash the crap out of them. It is a versatile and reliable auxiliary weapon and a perfect complement to the Incisor. "

8894, "Last but not least, a special delivery from the Anjaneya. No, please, no need for a hug or kiss, a simple 'thank you' is enough. I had to pull a few strings, but I did it. 

A complement of $y Heretic fighters is now available for your squadron. "

8895, "$B Tactical $B Arbiter $B Thynne:
Attention, Direwolves! Here is your next assignment. As you know, $G Colony $G Fleet is now leaving $B Terminus through the Ancient subspace portal. However, the Shivans are pressing us hard, so we need a distraction to slow their progress and minimize the casualties taken by our civilian convoys. $G BOD assault squadrons are already performing swift hit-and-run strikes against Shivan targets. Fleetmaster Tyrone wants us to join them. All combat-ready forces of $G Roaming $G Fleet have been divided into small task forces and will attack Shivan rally points throughout the system. "

8896, "Exodus Fleet"

8897, "You will join $G Harmattan and $G Andrasta. Together, you will participate in several tactical strikes. Each time your mission will be to protect both frigates and destroy all enemy forces in the field of engagement. However, you have to be ready for a quick departure, as the Shivans have powerful reinforcements ready to deploy against you. We want to attract as many Shivans to your location as possible. As soon as the Shivan have dispatched the largest number of forces possible, you must leave the area immediately as we are in no position to confront them all in close combat. When you are given the order to depart, you will make a nanojump to assist our frigates at the next Shivan rally point. "

8898, "Your first target is the $B Delta $B Lacertae jump node. You must destroy all enemy forces be arriving in Terminus. We expect the Shivans to deploy additional warships quickly. Engage them at your discretion, but avoid enemy destroyers and large groups of cruisers. You must be ready to depart as soon as it gets too hot to continue fighting. 

Good luck, pilots. "

8899, "Tactical Arbiter Thynne:
You have done well on this assignment, Direwolves. Your raid on Shivan positions inflicted substantial damage to the enemy armada and allowed the civilians to take a breath. The majority of the Roaming Fleet, supported by BOD forces, were involved in similar engagements at the same time. Simultaneous strikes in multiple sectors of the system have distracted the Shivans for a while, but with the quantity of enemy reinforcements entering Terminus it won't be long before we are overrun. Fleetmaster Tyrone's forces are low on fuel and ammo and our fighter squadrons have taken heavy losses in recent engagements. 

In the meantime, the Colony Fleet has almost made it through the Malia. Heavy Fleet is now defending the last convoys. We can expect that all civilians will be safe on the other side in a matter of hours. The Ironclad is still holding position to coordinate attacks against the Shivans, but we will soon follow the rest of the fleet to the Malia. 

Get some rest, but don't get distracted. As soon as the other squadrons return from raids, Fleetmaster Tyrone will send our remaining forces to the Malia. The Shivans will deploy everything they have to stop us. Prepare yourselves for the last lap, Direwolves. We need you to be at full combat readiness to reach the portal. "

8900, "Harmattan did not survive the rally on Shivan positions. As Shipmaster Le Brunon underestimated the enemy forces and you, pilots, failed to provide him enough cover, his frigate was destroyed just before the last lap to get us out of here. It was an unnecessary loss. "

8901, "The EFFg Andrasta was destroyed with her entire crew. You were expected to provide her enough cover to withstand the Shivan attacks and secure all designated locations. Without her it will be much more difficult for the Ironclad to reach the Malia. "

8902, "The Akka artillery frigate was destroyed when assaulting the Shivan destroyer Iblis. We regret its loss, as long-range support may have been crucial in the final stage of our travel to Malia. "

8958, "Me? Screw up? I don't even understand the concept, fleetmaster! Don't worry, sir, consider this Demon dead. "

8968, "We're on it, Andrasta. Rest assured, none of them will even scratch you. "

8970, "The Iblis is blowing up! Excellent. "

8971, "Attention all units. Good work with the Iblis. Now, that you have dealt with that threat, you will re-join Ironclad. Most of the Colony Fleet is already safe in Andromeda and we have no business staying here any longer than necessary. We don't want to abuse Shivan hospitality, do we?"

8972, "Acknowledged, Fleetmaster Tyrone. I couldn't agree more. Expect us at the rendezvous. "

8982, "You could maybe catch up to our kill count a little bit if you stop talking and try shooting, Le Brunon. "

At ease. I don't usually brief pilots on a personal basis. However, I've decided otherwise this time around. We went through hell over the last few weeks. We lost our homeworlds, our friends and our families. Total annihilation at the hands of the $R Shivans seemed to be assured. Yet, here we stand$semicolon outcasts and nomads of a once proud civilization struggling to survive.

The $R Shivans now have full control over $B Terminus, which means they can deploy every single asset they have against us... And they surely will. We expect them to repeatedly throw their forces at us wave after wave, wing after wing, warship after warship. They will descend upon us with full force, seeking to break our spirit and overwhelm our battlegroup with their numbers. But no, we shall not falter. Instead, we shall hold the line and prevail. "

9008, "Remember what the plan is$semicolon As soon as our battlegroup has crossed into $B Andromeda, we will set the $B Ancient ship that maintains control over the portal to shut down its connection.

9053, "Falchion 1, give me a status report on the Tyrant's forward beam cannons! "

9054, "Three beams are still operational. Two have minor damage. We made two attack runs against it, but faced strong resistance from the Tyrant's fighter screen. Only four of our gunships remain. We are now inbound to reinforce your position. "

9055, "We will have a very short time window in which to disable those beam cannons. Alpha, Beta, form up on the gunships when they arrive. Destroying the Tyrant's beams is your top priority. We will deploy Gamma wing to handle any bomber formations. "

9056, "Fleetmaster Tyrone, this is Magistrate Al-Zardari! Listen to me! You will not win this battle without the help of the Mastermind! You can use its powers to your advantage. "

9057, "High Magistrate, that is not a risk I am willing to take. Mastermind failed us. It led us into a trap and cost us thousands of lives. Many more might've been lost if not for Fleetmaster Tessandras' help. No, I will not use it. We can handle this ourselves. "

9058, "No, you can't, Fleetmaster! Your battlegroup will be torn tio pieces. But with Mastermind, you could manipulate the portal's subspace matrix$semicolon and use it to disrupt the Tyrant's arrival vector and therefore buy yourself time to counterattack it. "

9059, "And how do you know this will work? How do you know this is not just another trick it's playing? "

9060, "I don't. But if you..."

9061, "We may have failed you once before. But now, we are your only hope. You have to trust us, Fleetmaster Tyrone. "

9062, "Holy shit! That's the voice we heard before! It was the Mastermind talking to us! He's in our communication channels! "

9063, "The one who traveled here before you, the one you call Admiral Rossendarch, knows much more about the Shivans than we anticipated. He created a fake signal within the Shivan network. That is why we saw the collapsed jump node to Messier 80 as an active one. "

9064, "This time, we are not mistaken. You will not destroy the Tyrant without our aid. Allow us to connect with the Chania or perish. The choice is yours, Terrans. "

9065, "V-v-very well... I'm opening a connection with the Chania. We're in your hands now. "

9066, "Your decision is most wise, Fleetmaster. "

9067, "Massive subspace transit detected! The Tyrant is on rapid approach toward us! "

9068, "Now is the time! Activate the transmitter, Mastermind! "

9069, "It shall be done. "

9070, "Holy crap, it actually worked! The Tyrant has been thrown off-course! We've gained a significant head start against it! "

9071, "Now the battle is yours, Terrans. Destroy the beam cannons and you will have a chance to claim victory. "

9072, "Thank you... whoever you really are. I will never forget what you have done for us and the Fleet. "

9073, "Falchion wing reporting in! Looks like our return was well timed, Ironclad control. We're targeting the Tyrant's beam cannons and preparing to commence our attack run. "

9074, "All fighters, form up on Falchion wing! Protect the gunships at all costs! It's up to us to make sure they shred those beam cannons!"

9075, "Shivan fighters closing on the gunships! Take them out!"

9076, "The first beam cannon has been eliminated!"

9077, "Two down! Only one more remains active!"

9078, "Falchion 1 to Ironclad control. Strike successful! All the Tyrant's primary beam cannons have been destroyed! "

9079, "Excellent work, pilots! Disengage and pull back to the Ironclad. With the Tyrant's primary beams offline, we should be capable of reaching the Malia. "

9080, "We've got more trouble brewing! Two Shivan destroyers, the SD Vual and SD Andromalius, are entering the field! They are trying to block our escape path! "

9081, "Those obstacles need to be cleared! Falchion wing, prepare to snipe Shivan beam cannons. We will move in closer and try to drive away their fighter escorts first. "

9082, "Additional Shivan warships arriving! We are being flanked! I never thought I'd be the one to say it... but we're not gonna make it, Fleetmaster! "

9083, "I never would've expected a moment of doubt from you, Le Brunon. Not even now. We must try! Press forward!"

9084, "Listen carefully, Terrans. The one you call Fleetmaster Caliphtys tried to shut down the Malia and entrap you. We have prevented him from doing so for now, but have also calculated your odds. With these new reinforcements, your chances of reaching the portal are minimal. "

9085, "Either reinforcements must be dispatched or you have to shut down the Malia yourselves. Otherwise, the Shivans will enter Andromeda and overrun the Exodus Fleet. All other outcomes are impossible. "

9086, "Fleetmaster Tyrone, this is Fleetmaster Caliphtys. Congratulations on your valiant effort in neutralizing the Tyrant's forward beams. However, these new Shivan reinforcements represent a major threat to both you and us. "

9087, "I am not asking for any of these, Fleetmaster Caliphtys. Just hold the line for us. We will make it out alive, I promise you. "

9088, "I admire your determination, but you must realize that you cannot win here. We must not put the entire fleet at risk again. Therefore, you have to close the portal, Fleetmaster, and do so this very instant! "

9089, "What!? They wanna leave us all behind!?"

9090, "We can still make it out, Caliphtys! I am not going to shut down that portal. Not until every last one of us makes it through! "

9091, "You are a brave man, Fleetmaster Tyrone. We are indebted to you for your actions and your memory will be honored by generations to come. But the fleet must demand this sacrifice from you if it is to have a future."

9092, "The SFg Namtar and SC Ad-Dajjal are inbound! Fleetmaster, if we have to give our lives and hold the Shivans here, so be it! But whatever you decide, sir, do it quickly! "

9093, "I hate to ask such a thing from you, Horatio. Were there another option, I would not even dare to consider it... but there isn't one, I'm afraid. "

9094, "So be it. Do not waste the time our sacrifice buys you, Fleetmaster Caliphtys. I am reopening our connection with the Chania. Initiating deactivation procedure in... t minus three and a half minutes. "

9095, "All ships, switch off secondary systems and direct all power reserves to rail cooling systems. Maximize all firepower! If this is indeed to be our last hour, then let it be a glorious one! For the Fleet! Make the bastards pay for Europa and for Earth! "

9096, "Damn it all! I didn't think it would end this way... "

9097, "I should have fucked Swifty when I had the chance. "

9098, "It's been an honor to fight side by side with you, people. But now, the time for words is over! If we're dying here today, let's see to it that we populate hell with as many of these bastards as we can!"

9099, "Here they come... The Tyrant is launching multiple bomber wings! Watch out! "

9100, "Fleetmaster Tyrone! Do NOT shut down the Malia! I repeat, do NOT shut down the Malia! The Anjaneya is coming for you! Just hold your position until we arrive!"

9101, "Fleetmaster Raji, I cannot condone such actions from you. Do not sacrifice yourself like this! The Fleet needs you more than I do! Stay in Andromeda, where it is safe!"

9102, "Fleetmaster Raji, stand down and hold your position! You were given strict orders to..."

9103, "Screw your orders, Caliphtys! Tyrone is the best of all of us. I won't let you leave him or anyone else to die. Hang in there, Horatio! We're on our way."

9104, "Aasira, I... thank you. But you can't just..."

9105, "Shut your mouth and focus on staying alive, Horatio. If you end up getting yourself killed, I am personally going to make you regret it. Raji, out. "

9106, "This is the Anjaneya. How are you holding up over there, Ironclad? "

9107, "I'm usually have better moments than this one, Anjaneya. Thank you for returning for us. I am never going to forget this... "

9108, "You can find many ways to thank me once everyone is safe in Andromeda. Now, we have a battle to finish. All units, hit that blockade with everything you've got! I want it smashed to atoms! "

9109, "All ships, move into assault formation. Lock all batteries on the Tyrant and fire at will once in range. Harmattan, Andrasta, calibrate your long range torpedoes and take out those side beams for us. "

9110, "We have eliminated the Vual. "

9111, "The Shivan blockade has been annihilated. Ironclad, we are moving to reinforce you. Only the Tyrant remains against us. "

9112, "The Tyrant has dropped below 50 percent! Keep firing! We can bring all of this to an end!"

9113, "The Tyrant's hull integrity is below 25 percent! Do not stop! The juggernaut is failing!"

9114, "It is almost over! The Tyrant's hull has fallen below 10 percent structural integrity! "

9115, "The Tyrant is coming apart! All units, stand clear of the explosion! "

9116, "Ironclad here! The Shivans are hitting us with great force! If we keep taking damage like this, we'll never make the jump to Andromeda!"

9117, "The Andrasta's hull integrity is dropping rapidly! We'll start losing essential systems soon! Fighters, we need covering fire over here!"

9118, "It's getting very unpleasant here! We wouldn't mind the Harmattan getting additional cover right about now!"

9119, "This is the Akka. Our hull is failing and we're suffering critical damage! Requesting additional fighter support! "

9120, "Nooooo! The Ironclad is going down!"

9121, "We've lost the Harmattan! Damn it!"

9122, "Damn it! The Andrasta has been shot down!"

9123, "We just lost our artillery support! The Akka is gone!"

9139, "Then don't wait for them to close in! Break and tackle them head on! We still have a job to do, Beta! "

9140, "Right behind you, Fleetmaster. A pleasure as always to be kicking Shivan asses alongside you! "

9141, "Le Brunon, it is rare moments like these where you almost convince me people might stop calling you the 'dumbass shipmaster' someday. "

9142, "The Shivans are launching a large-scale offensive into Andromeda as we speak. Our ships are heavily damaged and cannot hold the blockade for long. I cannot risk letting more of them crossover to us. Sending the fleet back to Terminus is not an option either. "

9143, "It's about to get worse. The destroyers are covering an assault on the portal! If we allow the Shivans to gain a foothold in Andromeda, we lose all hope of escaping them! "

9144, "Ironclad, the Tyrant is powering its subspace drive! It is trying to escape! "

9145, "Let him go. We are not in any condition to be chasing him down. We'll defeat the Tyrant another day... "

9146, "No. Its departure must be prevented. We have been in sync with all your fighters throughout the entire battle, probing the Tyrant for weaknesses. Beta 1, approach the Tyrant and scan its navigation systems. We shall cripple it from within. "

9147, "You've been... what!? You've been in my fighter all the time!? But I... shit, I'd best be on my way. Beta, cover my approach. That bastard is not going anywhere. "

9148, "Got it. I scanned the Tyrant's nav systems. I hope you make good use of what you find. "

9149, "Indeed, we will. Stay clear of the engines. The hour of the Tyrant's demise is at hand. "

9150, "I can hardly believe it... The Tyrant has been completely disabled! All ships, we cannot squander the opportunity before us! Target the juggernaut and let's finish the job! "

9155, "Duke, of all times... ah, to hell with it! I'm not gonna shy away from a challenge like that. Show me what you've got, you glorious bastard!"

9156, "Surely, you understand the stakes here. If the portal remains open, the Shivans will pour in and finish what they started. It's either you or what remains of the human race as we know it. "
