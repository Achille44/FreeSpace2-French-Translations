4007, "A product of joint Terran-Vasudan design, the Ulysses is a Great War-era light space superiority fighter renowned for its maneuverability and slim target profile. It saw limited action during the Second Shivan Incursion, serving on front-line units with the Neo-Terran Front and as a combat evaluation fighter with the GTVA. The Ulysses remains in very limited production, but has been completely retired from front-line GTVA formations."

4008, "The Hercules assault fighter was the crowning jewel of Allied fighter forces during the Great War, and it remained a favorite amongst pilots even after the introduction of its successor, the Hercules II. Many Hercules units were lost during the NTF rebellion. The Hercules has been pulled from front-line service, and production has been discontinued. Remaining spaceframes serve as targets or in security operations. "

4009, "The Hercules II assault fighter sacrifices some of its predecessor's cannon firepower for a boost in secondary capacity. The modernized, hybrid spaceframe offers enhanced ordnance bays and a sophisticated fire control computer. The Hercules II performed well during its OpEval period and, despite casualties during the Second Shivan Incursion, was judged a success in its assigned role attacking lightly defended targets and cruisers. However, the introduction of the Ares spaceframe, a modified Hercules II, has limited Hercules II deployment in the true heavy assault role. Hercules II fighters are used as skirmishers against lightly defended convoys, and as heavy missile pickets on escort missions."

4010, "The Ares was the result of a crash program to rebuild the Hercules Mark 2 as a heavily armored missile boat. Slower and clumsier than its base model, the Ares mounts depleted uranium armor plating over critical subsystems, molybdenum plates,and enhanced shields. It can carry sufficient Trebuchet missiles to disarm a light warship or fend off multiple bomber wings before rearming. The Ares entered service just as the Shivans stormed Capella, and what few units were available saved thousands of lives during escort missions. Despite a stormy production history, the Ares is now a front-line combatant, used in heavy assault missions, pop-up Trebuchet strikes, and critical defensive missions. Despite its usefulness as a missile platform, it cannot dogfight effectively, and must avoid interceptors at all costs."

4011, "The Erinyes had barely entered its OpEval period when the Second Shivan incursion began. It served with SOC units and, later, elite line squadrons, where it gained a reputation for massive firepower but low sustainability. Mounting the UD-8 Kayser probability weapon, the Erinyes' eight gun banks and good secondary capability give it tremendous killing power. But its reactor cannot handle the strain of sustained fire, and its maneuverability leaves something to be desired. Although it proved effective at massacring most Shivan fighters, and went into wide-scale production during the Threat Exigency Initiative, it remains an oddly paradoxical design - an excellent killer but a limited fighter. As agility became more and more critical to fighter design, the complex Erinyes proved impossible to re-engineer. Although it remains in service with elite squadrons for heavy space superiority missions, it will soon be superceded by the next-generation GTF Nyx."

4012, "The linchpin of GTI fighter forces during Rybak's Hades Rebellion was the Loki stealth fighter. Initially an invisible nightmare, the Loki lost its main tactical advantage when a weakness in its stealth systems was discovered. It was moved into the role of scout fighter during Reconstruction, but was often pressed into the dogfight and intercept role by the Neo-Terran Front, where it earned praise for its agility but struggled to compensate for its structural weakness. The Loki has not been produced since the NTF Rebellion, and most remaining spaceframes have been sold off."

4013, "The low-visibility, sensor-stealthed Pegasus fighter is a recon platform above all else. Operated primarily by Special Operations Command, Pegasus pilots work in pairs or alone, cruising for long cold hours or days without making telltale subspace jumps. The onboard sensor systems are adequate to the recon task, but limited by the need to maintain EMCON. Even when they must make subspace transits, Pegasus jump drives are difficult to detect or vector. Pegasus pilots gathered critical information that helped suppress brush wars after the Second Incursion, and allegedly performed deniable assassination missions. "

4014, "The mainstay of the Terran fleet after the Second Incursion, the Perseus is produced on nearly every world in the Alliance and assigned to every destroyer in every battle group. Reassigned from intercept to multirole combatant after its sterling performance during the Second Incursion, the Perseus is cheap, flexible, and an excellent dogfighter and interceptor. In a pinch it can perform anti-subsystem strikes on warships with Stiletto II bombs. Even with the advent of next-generation fighters, the Perseus will remain in service for years to come."

4015, "The Myrmidon fighter, designed by RNI Systems to fulfill an impossibly broad request from the Admiralty, is a space superiority fighter with problematic handling, the primary firepower of an assault craft, and three secondary banks of unusual design and limited capacity. It is gradually being phased out, but still serves as a line fighter, bomber escort, and battle group guardian across the Terran elements of the Alliance fleet. Some pilots achieve a particular affinity with this unusual craft, but in general its wide target profile has given it a reputation as a pilot-killer. Captured Neo-Terran Front pilots reported that the Myrmidon was respected for its firepower but considered too clumsy for its role."

4016, "Captured Shivan Mara space superiority fighters played a key role in Alliance covert operations during the Second Incursion, including SOC's penetration into a binary star system beyond the second known Knossos device. With the dead pilots defused from the craft, Alliance technicians were able to modify the Maras to support conventional weapons, propellant, and avionics. Simple modifications expanded their performance envelopes, inexplicably exceeding the indigenous Shivan design, although a number of major sensor and navigation systems remained nonfunctional and in fact unexplained. Pilots operated the craft inside a biosealed environment. Data on post-traumatic stress and mental outcomes in Mara pilots is classified level Phi. Alliance analysts believe the Mara represents a cost-performance optimum in the Shivan manufacturing process, but the Shivans seem to leave the fighter significantly undergunned."

The Aurora is a swift fighter and carries several advanced avionics and sensor systems to assist in the gathering of information. However, the added equipment has produced a heavy hull, limiting the combat manoeuverability of the design. Aurora fighters are currently undergoing mission trials with the 14th Battlegroup in the Sol system."

4029, "GTF Kulas"

4030, "The GTF Kulas is a light fighter in active deployment in the GTVA Navy. The Kulas existed as a paramilitary light fighter long before the conception of the Threat Exigency Initiative, but the deployment of the fighter into the front lines is officially recognised as the incipient event of the TEI's Wave One program.

In the aftermath of the Second Shivan Incursion, the GTVA fleet was exhausted and demoralised. Fighter strength was at its lowest since the Great War and several GTVA systems were at dangerous levels of unrest. High Command authorised a crash program to make replete the Terran fighter corps as part of the first steps towards rebuilding the GTVA navy. Utilising a venerable but versatile paramilitary spaceframe, RNI Systems spearheaded the modernisation of the Kulas and began bulk production of the light fighter.

The Kulas suited the post-Incursion fleet perfectly. The fighter already had a low power draw - upgrading the reactor gave an almost limitless reserve. She was still average in performance, but she now had the ability to maintain peak performance for longer than any other fighter in service. Her capacitor allowed for extended afterburner usage - though faster fighters would beat her in a sprint, none could match her ability to run marathons. Armed with the ultra-efficient Balor cannon, pilots were able to shunt more power to shields on the fly, improving the surviveability of the design. Finally, a light hull afforded a maneuverability which pilots loved, making the Kulas a superb dogfighter.

The GTF Kulas would never reach the heights of the advanced fighters that would succeed her. She would be outpaced by future interceptors, outgunned by new assault fighters and outperformed by modern huntresses. However, she would become emblematic of the first wave of strikecraft in the Threat Exigency Initiative - a versatile multi-role fighter that could perform any task asked of her with the endurance to carry on in a difficult post-Incursion environment."

4032, "GTF Atalanta"

4033, "The Atalanta is the first of the Threat Exigency Initiative's Wave 2 fighters, true next-generation strike craft with extraordinarily capabilities. Produced in record time by the Alliance's first wholly classified procurement and design process - plagued by rumors of intrigue and mysterious 'red assets' - the Atalanta is an elegant, minimalist design wholly devoted to murdering other strike craft with very nearly Shivan flight characteristics. The original specifications of the Atalanta called for a multirole interceptor and space superiority fighter. Due to the United Earth Federation's fighter corps' successes, this variant has been field-modified to enhance its capabilities in the space-superiority role. These fighters remain rare in the Terran theatre, but they are likely to become a mainstay of Alliance forces in the near future."

4036, "GTF Nyx"

4037, "A product of the second wave of Threat Exigency Initiative fighters, the advanced GTF Nyx is one of the newest GTVA heavy fighters, falling somewhere between multirole heavy assault/space superiority niche and the Vasudan concept of a space dominance fighter. The design was fast-tracked in 2385 as a response to increasing fighter losses to superior UEF fighter designs. A dedicated gunship killer, with heavy armour and firepower, this fighter has become the bane of many a UEF pilot. It marries the Erinyes' eight gun banks with the agility and versatility of the Perseus interceptor, producing a sterling design that has become a pilot favorite. Extraordinary cost, however, has slowed its planned deployment."

4038, "GTF Draco"

4039, "Triton Dynamics/Nankam Aeronautical"

4040, "Analysis of defensive actions during the Second Incursion, such as the evacuation of Third Fleet Headquarters in Capella, revealed systemic failures in defensive fighter coverage. Multi-axis attack by lightly escorted Shivan bombers demanded rapid redeployment across kilometers of space, and in terms of pure linear speed, no Terran fighter design was up to the challenge. When the Threat Exigency Initiative was launched, one of the first demands of the GTVA admiralty was for a new dedicated fighter design in the pure intercept role, a tactical niche left empty since the retirement of the GTF Valkyrie in 2361.  

The result of a rare collaboration between Triton Dynamics and its longtime competitor Nankam Aeronautical, including subcontracts to Snapka-Flegel and Boone Thrusters, the Draco was accepted for combat evaluation trials a few weeks before the outbreak of the war in Sol, conducting peacekeeping and customs operations in the Terran periphery.  Its stunning speed and fast recharge drive capacitors quickly made it a pilot favorite. 

Evaluation did not complete in time for the departure of the 14th Battlegroup, and GTVA Command further held back its deployment to the Sol theater for fear that it would be easy prey for UEF point defenses and the heavier Kentauroi.  While it remains a rare sight, these concerns were largely unfounded, and thanks to a doctrine of evasion and attack by pure speed, the Draco now enjoys one of the highest kill/casualty ratios of any Alliance strikecraft in the conflict. Although its light weapons suite - designed to engage Shivan bombers and intercept warheads - leaves it arguably undergunned when attacking heavier UEF strike craft, the Draco nonetheless exerts a powerful tactical presence, dictating terms of engagement and placing its opponents firmly on the defensive."

4053, "After a strong showing during the NTF rebellion, Artemis bombers now represent the majority of the GTVA's tactical strike ability. Maneuverable and cheap, the Artemis is able to deliver its payload rapidly. Tactical analysis suggested that bombers rarely survived prolonged engagement, so the Artemis' limited warhead capacity is considered non-problematic. Without defensive turrets, the Artemis is reliant on fighter escort, but it can dogfight if pressed. This behavior is strongly discouraged during pilot training, but because Artemis bombers are often deployed with inadequate escort, it frequently becomes necessary. The bomber's single primary bank is often fitted with a Maxim cannon for supplementary firepower."

4054, "A more maneuverable variant of the Artemis bomber, the Artemis DH has seen production alongside its white-skinned cousin. It is used in the same tactical role, targeting cruisers and corvettes."

4055, "The Medusa is an obsolete Great War-era bomber. It was used in an anti-shipping role by the Neo-Terran Front, but never met with any real success. GTVA pilots considered the Medusa an ineffective deathtrap. "

4056, "Fifty years after the Great War, the Ursa bomber still serves the GTVA as an inflexible but powerful anti-shipping platform. With limited speed, the Ursa struggles to reach its targets, and in spite of heavy armor it cannot survive engagement with even a single interceptor. Its large target profile renders it vulnerable to flak and beam fire. Tactical doctrine calls for Ursa deployment against destroyers after their antifighter defenses are disarmed and their fighter complement depleted. Designers today consider the Ursa a dead end, and strive to manufacture bombers with fighter-like maneuverability and speed."

4057, "The Zeus was a GTI tactical bomber, designed for light anti-shipping work and as a tactical missile platform. For nearly twelve years after the Second Incursion, the Zeus actually remained in production to serve as a stopgap Trebuchet delivery system, as well as in its historical role carrying light warheads like the Stiletto II. The Zeus now serves as a training target and has been largely removed from service."

4058, "A controversial new heavy bomber at the time of the Second Incursion, the Boanerges proved a logistical dream but a mixed blessing tactically. Heavily shielded and with a large payload, the Boanerges eschewed defensive turrets as 'of limited use'. Bomber pilots did not react positively to this decision, and although the Boanerges is at least capable in its role, it still divides pilots today. Good maneuverability allows the Boanerges some success in reaching its targets, but in spite of heavy armor it cannot withstand defensive fire from warships or interceptors. It is an open question whether heavy bombers will remain tactically relevant. For the moment, however, the Boanerges' easy maintenance, cheap assembly, and long lifespan make it common in the heavy anti-shipping and anti-installation role."

4059, "GTB Rhea"

4060, "The Rhea is Han-Ronald's next generation strike bomber.  Its primary role was, at least in theory, to conduct precisions strikes against targets without the need for a dedicated escort wing. This tactic has been quietly discouraged by squadron leaders, and although the Rhea is generally considered a success, it now flies with escort like other bomber designs. Its unusual asymmetrical design is unpopular with pilots, but it appears to be a statistical success even amongst the historically casualty-prone bomber force."

4080, "Flak Turret"

4081, "The Fenris was never a successful warship design. Too lightly armored to withstand assault fighter attacks, unable to meaningfully engage other warships even after upgraded with beam weapons, and bogged down by inefficient reactors and an obsolete spaceframe, the Fenris is now used solely as a target or a patrol cruiser. Cramped quarters and an inflated crew count due to obsolete automation make posting to a Fenris into a punishment detail."

4083, "AAA Beam"

4084, "The Hippocrates medical ship is built in multiple, easily isolated compartments in case of disease outbreak. These vessels are amongst the GTVA's most important, traveling from system to system to provide disaster relief and specialized medical facilities. The Hippocrates can carry thousands of patients, and as such, the Block 2 upgrade provided it with some defense: anti-fighter weapons and even a light beam cannon. However, only the most desperate of circumstances would necessitate their use."

4085, "Unlike its cousin the Fenris, with which it shares a spaceframe, the Leviathan remains in limited use in some battle groups as a destroyer defense picket. It is useless against modern warships, but its four Phalanx anti-fighter systems give it respectable deterrent ability. Painfully slow both in realspace and in terms of subspace agility, the Leviathan is a crude, inefficient, and largely obsolete warship."

4086, "The Faustus science cruiser is a tactical disaster and strategic asset of unparalleled worth. Terran-Vasudan shield systems were designed aboard a Faustus during the Great War, and when the Alliance discovered the Knossos portal 32 years later, the same class of science cruisers carried Mina Hargrove's team to their fateful work. Easily destroyed by even a single enemy fighter, the true worth of the Faustus lies in its onboard information and laboratory systems, including neural-net computers capable of agnostic response to a broad range of problems. Some see the Alliance's failure to develop a tactical science ship as a major failure. Others point to the constant race for grant money as an explanation for the longevity of the Faustus, since no one can afford a new ship. Whatever the case, an end to the current economic recession might see the design of a new lead science ship. Until then, the Faustus will continue to be upgraded and repurposed by those in search of truth."

4087, "Zephyrus gas miners harvest and transport deuterium for Alliance fusion drives. These vessels are vital strategic assets, but extensive armor or defensive systems would only slow them down. The new Anemoi-class logistics ship handles fueling in combat theaters, while the Zephyrus continues to serve as the lungs of the fleet. Wherever a secure gas giant may be found, pilots can expect Zephyrus operations. A small but outspoken faction in GTVA fleet doctrine, the Convoy Cabal, insists that the installation of a few modern point defense systems would allow the Zephyrus to contribute to convoy anti-warhead defense."

4088, "The Charybdis Advanced Warning and Control System is a fragile but extraordinarily useful piece of technology. Capable of calculating and rapidly relaying precise subspace jump coordinates, it enable GTVA fighters and bombers to approach their targets at optimal range. It can also perform blanket communications jamming, selectively block aspect lock on itself or friendly warships, or grant itself or nearby vessels limited stealth. OpEval equipment permits it to generate EMP blasts or to guide subspace missile strikes to their targets."

4089, "The magnificent Orion destroyer was the GTVA's heaviest line combatant in the Second Incursion, complementing the Hecate-class carriers. With the new Erebus class entering service, the Orion has at last found a worthy successor, and its five-decade career is nearing an end. Some Orions remain in service, including the storied GTD Carthage, now a Combat Evaluation Destroyer with modified jump drives."

4090, "Main Beam"

4091, "GTD Carthage"

4092, "The GTD Carthage is one of the oldest capital ships still in service with the Alliance fleet. Launched towards the end of the Great War, she has participated in most major campaigns fought by the GTVA, and her accumulated combat record is unparalleled. After she was nearly destroyed during the nebula campaign, she was refitted as a Combat Evaluation Unit Destroyer to field-test new armor, propulsion and ECM designs. Exact details are unavailable, but we do know that her anti-fighter armament has been substantially upgraded to allow her to survive in today's fighter-centric combat environment. We have also found indications that she has been fitted with a prototype sprint drive, essentially a second subspace drive for enhanced strategic agility. Her hull plating, in combination with her extensive redesign, have increased her combat survivability by several orders of magnitude. 

While the ship has been in active duty for the better part of 50 years, ONI estimates that destroying her or achieving a mission kill will take a lot of careful planning and a lot of firepower. The Carthage and her escort fleet have been under the command of Admiral Anita Lopez for 15 years, and while her command is primarily composed of old ship designs, all the rough edges have long since been worn away, and her Battlegroup is consistently found in the top 10 percent of the GTVA's Fleet Performance evaluations."

The Second Shivan Incursion proved the value of this strategy, but also highlighted its flaws. Whenever Hecate-class destroyers found themselves in direct combat with hostile warships, they failed to perform. The Hecate now makes up the bulk of the GTVA's destroyer fleet, and, in line with current fighter-heavy strategic doctrine, serves as a rear-area base for strike craft operations. Hecate destroyers never enter combat without their battlegroups. Superior fighter capacity and an excellent flight deck make the Hecate an extraordinarily flexible power projection system, and this ability is at the center of the GTVA's planning for future Shivan threats."

Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay. In the post-Capella era, Arcadias have assumed the role of system evacuation hubs, where civilian traffic rallies to take on refugees in case of Shivan attack."

4109, "The unsung cornerstone of Terran military might, the Ganymede ring is an integrated repair, resupply, and refit facility with onboard machine shops, electronics manufactories, and foundries. Each ring can service five warships simultaneously, including extension-of-service refits and block upgrades. The TEI upgrade to the Ganymede's adapter protocols was one of the most logistically and politically painful episodes in GTVA military history, with two flag officers falling to graft charges."

4110, "The Ancient civilization apparently constructed the Knossos portal to secure, stabilize, and expand a subspace node leading to a distant area of space. Aken Bosch rediscovered this portal in Ancient records, then incited the Neo-Terran rebellion to gain access. After the NTC Trinity powered up and transited the device, Shivan warships jumped through from the other side, initiating the Second Shivan Incursion. After extensive study by Doctor Hargrove's team, the Knossos was destroyed by meson warheads in an effort to contain the expanding Shivan threat.

Study of the Knossos technology led to breakthroughs in node engineering and the construction of the Sol Gate, which captured and stabilized a transient node to the Sol system, re-establishing Alliance contact with Earth. The economic and scientific demands of the project were colossal, but the Alliance is optimistic that renewed traffic with Earth will rapidly recoup both fiscal and strategic costs."

4111, "Developed at the Hideki Institute in Vega, the meson bomb is a strategic antimatter weapon of appalling power. Exploiting staged meson decay to unleash energies locally approaching the Big Bang environment, these weapons are temperamental, unbelievably expensive, and vital to defense doctrine. Only large clusters of meson weapons can reliably collapse subspace nodes, preventing Shivan outbreaks. The long firing sequences and relatively short range of strategic meson weapons make them unsuited for tactical applications except in the field of demolition, since enemy forces can outmaneuver or even disable the weapon. But tactical variants of this technology have now entered the GTVA arsenal."

4112, "GTI Asteria"

4113, "The GTI Asteria was originally designed as a lighter, forward-deployed sibling to the Arcadia. With nine docking points and a fighterbay, the station is well fitted to serve as a hub for local trade. After the Joint Tactical Platform was canceled in favor of the Anemoi logistics ship, military exigency pushed the Asteria forward as a supply outpost in contested areas. With 24 turrets, including modern anti-fighter beams, the Asteria's self-defense is adequate, but its primary function is as a logistical node."

4114, "Light Pulse"

4115, "Thirty thousand of the GTVA's finest, Terran and Vasudan alike, died aboard the GTVA Colossus when it was destroyed by a single Sathanas juggernaught in Capella. Twenty years of effort, along with all the pride and propaganda bound up in the massive warship, were lost in mere minutes. After this tragedy, GTVA warship design steered away from massive superships and towards more flexible advanced destroyers. In spite of frequent rumours, no plans to build a fleet of Colossus warships have ever been suggested."

4116, "The Deimos corvette is to the Terran fleet today what the Fenris was during the Great War. Built in vast quantities, the Deimos now serves as the myrmidon of the GTVA, employing its adequate beam firepower and excellent anti-fighter abilities in its role as destroyer escort, line corvette, patrol craft, and centerpiece of corvette battle teams. It is due to be augmented, but not replaced, by the new Bellerophon and Chimera corvettes. Molybdenum armor and Vasudan reactors give the Deimos excellent survivability and the ability to jump early and often. Deimos corvettes will continue to be produced for decades to come."

4117, "Although cruisers are now largely considered obsolete, the Aeolus was so successful at fending off fighters and bombers during the collapse of Capella that production lines were re-opened. New manufacturing techniques brought costs down, and today, Aeolus-class 'cruisers' serve in the role of tactical gunboat, escorting corvettes and destroyers and anchoring rapid-response Jump Five teams. They are ineffective against warships but truly nightmares to any nearby fighters."

4118, "GTC Cretheus"

4119, "The Cretheus gunboat, officially a Fast Picket, is a small, cheap, agile escort with dedicated antifighter defenses, limited anti-warship ability, and a tortured design history. The prototype was fielded during the Second Incursion, intended as a cheap, numerous escort platform armed with eight Flak Turrets. But the first prototype was lost during its OpEval period in a classified operation on the fringes of the Capella system, and the findings of the loss investigation pointed to unacceptable vulnerability to hostile beam-armed warships. RNI designers protested that the ship was never meant to operate under such conditions, but lobbying by the Akheton Corporation, which hoped to push a variant Mentu design into the light escort role, managed to block the other prototypes from deployment to Capella where, ironically, they might have saved tens of thousands of lives lost to Shivan bombers. The spaceframe was brought back into consideration during the first wave of the Threat Exigency Initiative, but Morgan Technologies asked for it to be held back until it could be packaged with first new fire control systems, then provisions for their new pulse weapons, then improved flak magazine storage. The design entered mass production two years before the Reunion in a number of variants, but the Akheton Corporation again held back its deployment, and it is only now being cycled into the Sol theater where it is intended as a gunship deterrent and point defense picket."

4120, "More than half a century old and still in production, the GTT Elysium transport is the definitive interstellar utility craft. The Elysium lineage has radiated into a dizzying number of variants, from engineering support craft to covert blockade runners. 

With only a single defensive turret and minimal armor, the Elysium should, one post-Capella swarm combatant refit notwithstanding, never be deployed in combat. But its small logistical footprint, fuel economy, and low downtime often put it in harm's way. The Elysium's single greatest asset may be its robust and flexible docking system."

4123, "GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. The Bravo variant uses twin missile lanchers drawing from an ammunition storage derived from the Hygeia support ship."

4125, "The Mjolnir beam cannon is a fantastically powerful but tactically inflexible weapons system commonly used for node defense. Mounting one of the most potent anti-warship attack systems in the GTVA arsenal, it is a threat to any warship. Critical vulnerability to fighter attack necessitates the deployment of escorts or other sentry guns. Dozens of Mjolnir weapons systems have been manufactured and are kept ready to form node blockades. Several are already deployed at the site of the collapsed Capella node in Vega."

4131, "Oldest of the next-generation GTVA warships, the Hyperion cruiser represents the Alliance's best shot at a new niche for the aging cruiser hull - a scout, skirmisher, and anti-fighter platform that can conduct reconnaissance by fire, draw off bomber wings, and engage larger ships from range with its Thorn Lance light beams.

With corvettes dominating the the main line combatant role, cruisers must be deployed - and built - more carefully. Hyperion captains train to respond to their many predators, including heavy assault wings and beam-armed warships.

After Capella, the Threat Exigency Initiative launched a push for new military technology and doctrine. At the center would be a next generation of warships, more agile, sophisticated, and survivable than their ancestors: capable of sliding around Shivan concentrations and applying force to gaps and weaknesses.

They would also be more expensive. Unfortunately, the Terran economy had just flown into a supernova.

GTVA High Command issued a requirement for a next-generation cruiser that could serve as an escort, skirmisher, and screen element. It would have the anti-fighter prowess of the Aeolus, a highly capable subspace drive, next-generation power systems, and electronic warfare capabilities. All this was true, but it was also a smokescreen.

In truth, the Hyperion-class cruiser was an attempt to shake down next-generation systems...and next-generation procurement. The Admiralty took a torch to the connections between the officer corps and Alliance contractors, then rebuilt the procurement system with brutalist efficiency. Careers flared up, burnt out, and spiraled off into nothing around the Hyperion as teams fought to get their systems on-board.

Economic sequestration placed the Hyperion in danger of cancellation, and suddenly project teams began withdrawing, trying to avoid tying their technology to a failed warship. This left the baffled hull designers with no choice but to build a ship without knowing what equipment it would carry.

The team drew on experience with the Deimos corvette to build the ship from the reactor out, selecting a simple hull form and flexible power grid. This allows the Hyperion to easily mount new systems. Even the forward beam cannons are trivial to replace if destroyed, since the emitters are isolated from the plasma cores.

The first block of Hyperions served as a testbed for meson reactors, pulse weapons, and next-generation beams. Although successful as anti-fighter pickets and reasonably affordable, they didn't hit the mark for subspace agility or anti-ship firepower. The class is still rolling through a series of block upgrades, expanding electronic warfare capabilities and installing survivability packages for the main weapons.

The Hyperion is notorious for the so-called 'bad quench' failure mode of its meson reactors, which severely limits the crew's chances of survival in the event of a hull loss."

4132, "GTCv Chimera"

4133, "The Chimera corvette is the archetypical next-generation warship, a flying beam cannon with a superb subspace drive and power grid. Designed to kill destroyers and Sathanas juggernauts, the Chimera mimics the shock jump tactics of the Second Incursion, drawing on the new ISN BACKBREAKER strategic communications and sensor fusion standard to plot jumps and find targets.

In combat, the Chimera points at the biggest ship around and fires until there's nothing left to shoot at. Three Aurora Wake main beams provide unsurpassed killing power for the hull size. Clouds of vaporized coolant gave the corvette the unflattering nickname 'the bong'. Thermal management is a major concern, and the corvette could easily destroy itself with unwise tactics, but the ship's power grid handles well.

Defensively, the Chimera counts on next-generation active armor and an array of pulse and beam weapons to screen it from bombers. Like all next-generation corvettes, the Chimera must be ready to serve as a destroyer escort.

Chimera production is ramping up, with the perhaps-ambitious goal of matching every Deimos battleteam with a single Chimera by the end of the century. With the exception of the beam reactors, the class came in well under budget.

Of all the TEI's next-generation warships, the Chimera had the smoothest development. Data from the Hyperion class allowed designers to choose simple priorities very early: light hull, huge guns, good heat sinks, good drive, all other concerns secondary. The power grid actually overshot the target, providing the class with excess capabilities that could be exploited by a Block 2 upgrade.

Unfortunately for Chimera crews, no amount of excess power has yet provided a solution for the corvette's abominable living conditions. A software error stocked the first example of the class, Pilum, with thousands of identical pre-cooked meal pouches, each one broccoli and tofu - leading to the much-beloved story of the Cooks' Mutiny. Live on a flying gun, the saying goes, and you get treated like a bullet."

4134, "GTCv Bellerophon"

4135, "The Bellerophon heavy corvette is a logical variant of the Chimera, mounting an Ice Queen destroyer-grade beam in place of one of its little sister's Aurora Wakes. The Bellerophon fills the exact same niche as the Chimera, but it brings more force to the battlespace.

Advocates of the Diomedes corvette fought hard to kill the Bellerophon, claiming it was redundant with the Chimera. But VEGADEX data suggested that marginal gains in speed-of-kill on hard targets like destroyers and juggernauts could create vital strategic opportunities. A difference in seconds could win victory. The Admiralty upheld the design requirement.

A special team directly under High Command expanded the hull into a triangular shape, hollowed out a space for a self-contained Ice Queen and thermal systems, and packed the new hull volume with command electronics and sensors so that the Bellerophon could serve as a corvette leader. When operating in a pack with other corvettes, the Bellerophon can integrate sensor data to generate fast and accurate navigational solutions. The Bellerophon actually contains more classified equipment per hull volume than any other main-line Alliance warship.

Some thermal issues plagued the first two spaceframes, leading to the installation of a hot-metal heat sink on the ventral hull.

To the dismay of Fleet crew, the Bellerophon shares a common life support space with the Chimera."

4136, "GTCv Diomedes"

4137, "Conceptualized early in the Threat Exigency Initiative warship program, the Diomedes-class strike corvette was shaped by the necessities of two worlds: the tactical realities of the post-Capella battlefield and the political turmoil of a Fleet in crisis. 

	GTVA designers conceived the Chimera and Bellerophon-class corvettes hand in hand with new doctrines of of massive force application. These designs were intentionally overspecialized to neutralize Shivan destroyers and juggernauts with beam alpha strikes. Strike craft support, aggressive subspace maneuvering, and sheer shock would, it was argued, allow the Chimera and Bellerophon to outrun their own design weaknesses.

	But more conservative factions of the GTVA military agitated for a less specialized next-generation design, a successor to and improvement upon the still-young Deimos corvette. Politically, they needed a warship that would fit the operational profile of line as well as elite units, but they also offered compelling tactical reasoning. Agile, aggressive combatants lacked the staying power for prolonged defensive operations at hardpoints, nodes, or convoys. A cheaper, more all-round design could supplement Deimos production with a powerful corvette leader or a supporting element to cover the flanks of destroyers or sister corvettes. Other camps in the Fleet added their own requirements: the addition of a fighterbay would open up possibilities as an SOC platform, or in the independent strike role through organic escorts or bombers. Missile launchers and magazines would allow for selectable munition loads.

	The notional Diomedes became a rallying point for design schools who had been pushed out of the main thrust of Threat Exigency Initiative work. The design went forward, but these competing requirements should have produced a catastrophic compromise.

	Instead, GTVA designers produced a fascinating warship, one whose weaknesses are addressed by carefully counterpointed strengths. Armed with four Bull Frost next-generation anti-warship beams in a pair of twinned lateral batteries, the Diomedes relies on its startling agility to bring its firepower to bear. Designed to engage targets abeam, the class rewards flanking tactics and circling engagements against larger hostiles and aggressive action against multiple lighter opponents. Considerable sacrifices were made to operationalize the ship's fighterbay, but the potency of an on-board interceptor or bomber unit justified the cost, particularly in the areas of point defense and counter-air. The Diomedes' weapons suite also includes light pulse cannons and a pair of missile launchers capable of anti-fighter or anti-warship fire. Unburdened by massive beam weapons, her reactors permit a modestly rapid jump cycle and excellent ESM and active armor capabilities.

	Even as the GTVA has cracked down on its own patronage system, dissolving the lines of influence that connected warship designers and commanders to particular schools, the Diomedes has acquired a reputation for scrappy flexibility and solitary pluck. Neglected by formal doctrine on the eve of the UEF-GTVA conflict except as a general 'flank escort' and 'fast response expedient', Diomedes captains drilled their own tactics and built a quiet professional community. 

	The ongoing conflict has found the Diomedes thrown into the fire, often alone, often undersupported, acting on sketchy intelligence to provide decisive force at key moments. Casualties among the Diomedes class exceed that of any other next-generation warship, but GTVA commanders have taken note of the design's successes, and of the discipline and capability of her crews. Once seen as the ugly duckling of the TEI warship line, the Diomedes now finds itself in strategic and tactical demand"

4138, "GTD Titan"

4139, "The Titan-class destroyer/strike carrier bases more fightercraft than any other Alliance vessel. Armed with a mighty triple array of 'Ice Queen' spinal beams, a battery of pulse weapons, and Supernova meson torpedoes, the Titan serves as a companion to the Erebus-class line destroyer.

In the event of a new Shivan incursion, the Titan will hold in support of its Erebus partner, deploying its fighter wings to generate and exploit openings. In this respect it resembles a larger Hecate-class. But the Titan also shares the Erebus' excellent subspace agility, and its main beams make it a capable shock attacker. Developing doctrine suggests that the Titan will serve either as a firefighter, leaping onto and erasing Shivan breakthroughs, or as a force lever to punch through vital targets.

Titan development proceeded under the codename COLD WEDGE. The first attempt drew on design principles from the Massive Mjolnir and Supercarrer design camps, but it failed when Triton Dynamics studies suggested the hull's ammunition stores would be catastrophically vulnerable. A second attempt began under a Vasudan project leader, but internal politics caused great offense, and only a hasty diplomatic intervention by Aya McCarthy retained the Vasudan team as a reactor lead.

The third iteration of the Titan design drew heavily on the Ravana destroyer, creating an eerie reputation around the team offices. The hull coalesced around a hangar module, a main beam spine, and a sophisticated engineering section for the drive and reactors. BACKBREAKER and SCORPION PROPHET combat management and network software coordinate the ship's systems, with added facilities for precise attacks out of subspace jumps. The Titan's power systems and ammunition stores are highly distributed to enhance resilience. Multiple emitter arrays give the Titan excellent long-range sensor and command capability. Because the Titan's role requires fewer sudden power transfers than the Erebus, its power grid is more conventional and less integrated, closely following the pattern established by the Hatshepsut.

Considerable dispute rages over the best use of the Titan's tactical presence. The class could serve as a supercarrier, an attrition sniper that leaps between hot spots and picks off primary targets, a floating reserve, or the hammer in a fix-and-fire team with the Erebus.

A long waiting list has developed for Titan postings, in part because of career opportunities for fighter officers, in part because of the type's excellent quarters. Conspiracy theorists often debate whether a module exists to replace the hangar bay with a long-term habitat so the Titan could serve as a deep-space ark."

4164, "The Erebus-class destroyer. Humanity's sharpest sword. Primary force concentration asset in the Threat Exigency Initiative's doctrine of effect warfare. A triumph of achievement in the face of adversity: both economic and existential.

The mission of the Erebus is to enter a tactical situation and successfully resolve it. No matter the threat, the Erebus is designed to deploy tactical intelligence, subspace agility, weapons fire, its onboard air wing, battle group command, and strategic connectivity in a unified plan to degrade and destroy the foe. Tactically, the Erebus depends on nothing.

Implicitly, the Erebus is meant to duel - and win against - small groups of Sathanas juggernauts. 

Armed with a WINTER KING long-range spinal beam cannon, an ICE QUEEN coaxial main beam, an array of anti-warship beams, a battery of massive pulse weapons, a comprehensive CIWS close-defense suite, selectable-load SARISSA-M1 torpedo launchers with subspace attack capability, and an active armor suite tougher than the Colossus, the Erebus is a killer. Her weapons layout suits her role as a door-kicker, plunging into formations of smaller warships, but she can also outrange a Sathanas juggernaut for as long as necessary to defang its weapons.

But a modern Alliance admiral asks about the weapons last. The platform's truly revolutionary capability lies with her tactical systems.

The Erebus' heart is an integrated power system fed by redundant meson reactors. Her overengineered grid can safely surge combat systems ranging from sensors to main beam weapons by orders of magnitude. Slurry heat sinks and generous thermal tolerances permit tactical overloads in emergency situations. Buttressed electronic countermeasures managed by a Vasudan SCORPION PROPHET combat net degrade the effectiveness of all incoming fire, from main warship beams through aspect-seeking warheads down to the very basic primary weapons of strike craft.

That same power system feeds a revolutionary sprint drive, a multi-core subspace engine capable of rapid subspace transits. Erebus' sensor/navigation fusion capability can retask classical and subspace arrays between tactical and navigational needs. A cutting-edge navigational system with a dedicated n-space active battery array cuts down calculation times and, some allege, permits at least tenuous plotting of multiple chained jumps.

Communications systems built to the Alliance's BACKBREAKER standard provide common operational capability in the face of most jamming, but the Erebus also boasts a command theater for battle group coordination in non-permissive comm environments. The Erebus' informational weapons systems are built to partner with a Titan-class destroyer, incorporating the Titan's air wing and battle group into force awareness. When multiple Erebus-class destroyers operate in the same theater, BACKBREAKER can designate a group leader or coordinate a flat, decentralized operational schedule which intelligently distributes tasks across the Erebus battle groups. Future upgrades may integrate AWACS capability directly into the destroyer.

The Erebus' primary design tradeoffs lie in her fusion drive, air wing, and logistics. As a line combatant, the Erebus carries few strike craft. She is as fast as a Sathanas, but no faster, relying on her subspace drive to keep the range. And while tactically independent, the Erebus requires more logistical tail than many next-generation warships.

Cataclysm gave birth to Erebus. The death throes of the GTVA Colossus killed more than thirty thousand officers and crew - and an entire philosophy of warship design. The detonation of the Capella star wiped out not only a densely populated system, but an entire concept of strategic action. No more would the GTVA depend on monumental centerpiece combatants, designed to draw the enemy into a single set piece engagement and score a knockout blow."

4187, "The Vasudans lost their homeworld to the Shivans. Nothing can heal that wound. But the Vasudans are a pragmatic people, resilient to loss, and when Operation Templar shattered the Hammer of Light, Mekhu Enterprises found something to take back - a Shivan bomber design adapted by the Hammer of Light. As if haunted by its origins, the Sekhmet maintains a ferocious reputation. Mekhu produced a spectacularly expensive juggernaut of a bomber, heavily armed and plated in molybdenum, a pocket warship stitched into a compact frame. The Sekhmet's power plant and drive actually make it capable of dogfighting at par with many fighters. Many of the design techniques used in the Sekhmet remain highly classified, and the spaceframe is still exclusively produced by Vasudan military corporations. No other bomber in the Alliance arsenal can strike in such a wide range of tactical environments.

Although once rare, the Vasudan economic boom has enabled widescale Sekhmet production, fulfilling Khonsu's requirement for organic fleetwide anti-destroyer capability. Training for a Sekhmet post is intense, ritualistic, and exclusive. Rumors of Hammer rituals plague the corps. In spite of this taint, the Sekhmet's raw power inspired the design philosophy behind modern Vasudan superfighters such as the Serekh Taa, Maa-kheru, and Abatos."

4188, "The obsolete Osiris was the primary Vasudan fleet bomber during the Great War. It performed well at the time, but as warships got tougher, the Osiris simply couldn't carry the payload required to score kills. Pulled from front-line order of battle, the Osiris remains in service with Vasudan system defense forces, armed with anti-subsystem munitions for police and customs work. Although obsolete Terran spacecraft are generally used as targets or sold off, the post-sorrow Vasudans have a tradition of private ship maintenance that keeps old designs in circulation. A spacecraft, they argue, is an obscenely expensive and intricate piece of technology, and it must be appreciated for its practical and historical worth.   

In recent months a surprising number of Osiris spaceframes have been purchased by Terran military contractors. Speculation suggests that the Terran defense establishment, frustrated with attrition in the strike bomber corps, has decided to look elsewhere for inspiration. The twin-turreted Osiris may represent performance data of interest. Interestingly, the terms of purchase neglected the usual stipulation for Terran environment and control refits."

4189, "The first modern strike bomber to enter the Alliance arsenal, the Bakha is an economic triumph. Built around two baffled Akh-12 engines, ancestors of the Ptah's stealth drive, the Bakha's elegant spaceframe won the hearts of hangar crews across the Vasudan navy. Slightly tougher than its Terran counterpart, the Artemis, the Bakha also boasts two separate primary gun banks. Defensive dogfighting is an integral part of Bakha pilot training. Perhaps most importantly, the Bakha passed through design and qualification in record time, and its production line is extremely economical. This makes the Bakha a natural partner to the hideously expensive Sekhmet.

The Bakha came to life almost wholly through nepotism and favor-trading. Fortunately, all the relatives involved were competent professionals with the best interests of the Vasudan people in mind. By the time of the NTF rebellion, shipyards over the grave of Vasuda Prime had turned out more than six thousand Bakhas. As the rebellion began to target Vasudan civilians, Bakha squadrons scrambled to protect Vasudan interests from NTF warships. One famous squadron, Atinmerit's 808th, violated standing orders and conducted pre-emptive attacks without fighter escort against NTF rallying points. This story provided the inspiration for the smash hit This Price I Pay. 

Like many products of the Pa-anmu Admiralty, the Bakha suffers when faced with layered anti-fighter defenses. Bakha squadrons developed SEAD tactics using Trebuchet and Stiletto missiles. Although the Bakha could not carry the Maxim cannon during the Second Incursion, Serapis fighters provided improvised support.

The single greatest failure the Bakha ever suffered related to the Helios warhead. The software hastily distributed for the Helios capability accidentally treated the weapon as a primary gun, not a guided warhead. Technicians aboard the Psamtik had to write their own code to get the Helios operational in time for the attack on the SJ Sathanas.

Modern marks of the Bakha fly under the designation Apis Bakha."

4190, "The Vasudans love hotrods. Nothing says it better than the Isis, a common tugboat, shuttle, repair ship, and light transport - which is also the deadliest commando ferry in the Alliance inventory. Armed with a pair of Mekhu HL-7 close defense weapons and powered by the beloved Akh-4 powerplant, the Isis can insert boarding parties or repair teams even in live combat. The Terran arm of the fleet has quietly purchased a number of Isis transports, and the Vasudans habitually up-gun them for use as tactical gunboats. The Isis remains in wide production. The design's only notable weakness is its limited payload."

4191, "The dowdy Ma'at dates back to Vasudan commerce in the 14 Year War, where it trundled massive cargo containers from system to system. The advent of shields neutered the Ma'at's defensive armament, but the real blow to the design was the Bes' propellant efficiency, which gave it a huge marginal advantage over the Ma'at on the same routes. Today, Ma'at freighters fly civilian runs, serviced by a cooperative of Vasudan artisans who produce upgrades and replacement parts at rates cheap enough to offset the Ma'at's operating costs. The famous Vasudan Ambassador Thot-hartis favored a Ma'at for hauling her extensive collection of diplomatically useful art, relics, and conversation pieces."

4192, "The beetle-backed Bes is the avatar of Vasudan Reconstruction. Commissioned twelve years after the end of the Great War, the Bes is a weapon of peace, admired both for its sleek aesthetic and its incredible propellant efficiency. The Bes hit the Vasudan shipping market like a snort of black sand. It could just keep moving and moving, slashing operating costs and commodity prices. It helped propel an economic boom that flowered into a new Vasudan golden age. Although Emperor Khonsu II is often credited for the design, he only intervened to resolve a dispute that had kept the engine snarled in production, the victim of a grudge that spiraled off the McCarthy Affair. In this respect his wisdom was surpassing. Today the Bes swarms trade lanes, cheerfully keeping up the flow of commerce. Vasudan attitudes towards objects are complex, and the Bes seems to carry an aura of awe and fear, as if it has built up too much success and must someday be rebalanced. Bes crews traditionally grow desert flowers in the condenser spaces. Pilots should note that the Bes is a frail target, with limited survivability against heavy assault craft - a tragic weakness during the NTF rebellion and post-Capella violence. However, its two turrets provide a capable addition to convoy warhead defense."

4193, "The Satis is a Great War-era freighter originally built for wartime self-defense. Armed with five plasma turrets, it could pose a serious threat to unshielded fighters, freeing up strike craft for offensive action. The rise of fighter shielding killed the Satis' original role, leaving it stranded as an economically inefficient freighter. But the Satis remains effective at warhead intercept, so it's often salted into convoy groups as a self-defense supplement. Vasudan Tactical Command has explored upgunning the Satis for light fire support."

4194, "A curious hybrid, the GVG Anuket serves the Vasudan fleet as a gas miner, fleet tender, and sophisticated science ship. As a miner it harvests deuterium from gas giants, weathering harsh electromagnetic environments to feed the fleet's thirst. As a tender, the Anuket is a single-solution refinery, converting raw materials directly into usable fuel. During Vasudan operations in the Second Incursion's nebular theater, the Anuket was refitted with a powerful sensor suite, including subspace tracking equipment. Onboard laboratories and hot rooms helped Vasudan scientists study the supernova remnant. In the years since Capella, the Anuket's mission creep has expanded, and a number of task modules fitted inside the tanker's cavernous holds now enable the hull to serve as a lab ship, listening post, medical transport, and limited electronic warfare platform. The huge sprawl of onboard mission software has created concerns about security flaws.

The Anuket has no meaningful self-defense capability beyond a single Crow Lash flak gun, but it can contribute to warhead intercept with light CIWS. The ship's snowballing mission capabilities led to Terran complaints that pilots would have no idea whether to treat an Anuket as a tactical asset or a bomb.

The new Tawaret logistics ship has similar refining capabilities to the Anuket, but it is specifically a military asset and does not serve in a commercial role."

4195, "In the post-Capella era, the Aten has been reclassified from cruiser to heavy picket. A senescent design, fragile and agonizingly undergunned, the Aten killed thousands of Vasudan officers and crew during the Second Incursion by simple inability to defend itself. Swarms of Shivan Basilisk fighters proved a particular menace, since their missiles were too small for intercept, but the Aten's lack of anti-warship beams meant it was no match for Shivan cruisers.

The Vasudan preoccupation with history and lineage is a source of real friction in fleet doctrine. The Vasudans, loathe to waste functional spacecraft, actually continue to maintain the Aten as a convoy escort. The hull has been upgraded to the Aten-Re standard, with enhanced active armor, hardened subsystems, a pair of modern KHAFRA BURN energy flak guns, a capacitor system feeding an Akheton pulse cannon, and improved TAG awareness for fire support. The pulse cannon provides interdiction and area denial capability against small groups of strike craft. Expanded automation collapses crew requirements to 250, leaving much of the hull uninhabited. These pickets serve as convoy motherships, packing components, fuel, and medical systems to manage any en-route emergencies.

The next-generation Vasudan cruiser, the GVC Akhenaten, fills the fast strike and skirmisher requirement that the Aten never met."

4196, "The Mentu should've been the Vasudan Navy's modern strike cruiser, built from the keel up to mount a pair of Mkh/Akh 121b anti-warship beams. A typically superb powerplant, including acoustic baffles engineered to rumble at pleasant frequencies, would keep the Mentu charging along at good speed even while operating the weapons. Intelligence and publicity documents from the Mentu's development make it clear that the design was meant to showcase Vasudan anti-warship beams.

But the Mentu was another ironic casualty of its ancestor's vices. The Aten cruiser was so cripplingly unsuited to front-line action that it would be reassigned as a convoy escort and rear-area picket once the Mentu joined the fleet. But leading members of the Kames Admiralty, who saw the future in direct action by modern destroyers, refused to accept the absence of an anti-fighter cruiser on the front lines. Destroyers could take out enemy warships, with fire support from the new corvettes. Someone had to shoot down all the bombers, and it certainly wouldn't be the fighter corps.

Through a series of manipulations that encompassed finance, social life, and art, the Kames Admiralty misdirected the Mentu's engineers about the heat requirements of the Mkh/Akh 121b. The result was a superb strike cruiser - without the heatsinks required to operate its own main weapons for more than a few shots. The 121b performed too well to be rebuilt. Less than six months before its OpEval period, the Mentu was redesigned as a fast escort with its main beams downgraded to Phalanx anti-fighter beams.

The officers responsible escaped prosecution, as they had simply arranged to be misunderstood. Their malfeasance may have saved lives. The Mentu served in the Second Incursion as a fast escort cruiser, swatting warheads and bombers with an excellent CIWS and interdiction arsenal. Tough, long-lasting, and well under budget, the Mentu worked well with the Sobek corvette in a sword-shield pair. Early in the war, Mentu captains developed the infamous Against Apsu maneuver, flying the GVC Somtus and GVC Mycerinus belly-to-belly to take advantage of their weapons and armor layout in an engagement against the NTF.

Ever since, Mentu captains take pride in the command to roll ship. The modern Mentu-Ra uses slurry coolant, finally granting it the heat capacity to mount anti-warship beams. It is the principle cruiser of the IVN. Older Mentu variants still serve as escorts, armed with pulse cannons and energy flak."

4197, "The Sobek is a superb ship-to-ship combatant, a brutal sword of a corvette that specializes in direct attacks against hostile warships up to destroyer size.

Military historians mark the Sobek as the beginning of the Second Incursion warship design era. After the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the SD Lucifer, the Admiralties issued a requirement for a new class of warship, a heavy destroyer escort that would be able to destroy any Shivan cruiser in single combat and make an accounting of itself against Shivan destroyers. The first Sobek design was long and slim, built around a pair of railgun-assisted flux cannon, a Vasudan torpedo weapon. The Sobek's designers also built a meticulous power grid in anticipation of future shield capabilities. Terran observers classified the ship as a corvette.

Warship-scale shielding failed to materialize, but beam technology matured, and the Sobek's reactor and hull profile proved a good match for the Mkh/Akh 182. This early beam cannon suffered range and accuracy issues. It pumped more matter than cruiser-scale beams, but lacked the huge plasma core clamps and bottle controls of destroyer-scale systems. Test fires tended to cavitate and fail into a spectacular but ineffective blowtorch.

Unlike Terran designers, however, Vasudan procurement occasionally makes concurrency work. Mekhu solved the blowtorch issue with the Mkh/Akh 183, which allowed the magnetic bottle to swivel, sacrificing accuracy for effect. Two of these beam weapons replaced the flux cannons in the Sobek's spine, operationalizing the Alliance's first corvette. Doctrine deploys the Sobek as a killer, focusing down single targets with the forward beams. In main fleet engagements, Sobeks seek out and prosecute any threat to friendly destroyers.

During the Second Incursion, the Sobek-class Dashor escorted the GTD Carthage during initial containment in Gamma Draconis. During the botched attack on the SD Ravana, the Khenmu outmaneuvered the Shivan destroyer, surviving to provide vital fire support. The Tatenen made first contact with the Sathanas, transmitting telemetry on the juggernaut's forward beam weapons even as it died to them. The Renenet and Thebes engaged Shivan forces during the campaign to destroy the Sathanas, taking out the SD Beleth and countless fighter wings. Again and again, Sobek corvettes proved their worth, even under impossible conditions.

The modern Sobek-Ra features enhanced active armor and EW capabilities, as well as a reactor refit and a total point defense upgrade to improve the Sobek's survivability against strike craft attack. The IVN deploys the Sobek-Ra as its mainstay warship alongside the Aaru-class heavy corvette."

4198, "The Typhon-class destroyer is a veteran of the Great War, an old soldier still doing the Emperor's work.

The Vasudans saw the Terran-Vasudan War primarily as a conflict of symbols and will. Very few Vasudan leaders believed that a civilized, spacefaring people could commit planetary-scale murder. However, the Vasudans saw the aggressive, paranoid Terrans as simplistic and unstable, and they sought to communicate by violence in terms the Terrans would respect. Vasudan tactics prized disorientation, violence of action, and psychological effect, up to and including suicide tactics.

The Typhon-class destroyer was built to incarnate Vasudan pride, a purposeful echo of the Terran Orion. Built in formidable secrecy, the original Typhon featured anti-fighter missiles, heavy plasma weapons, and a staggering hangar capacity. At the Vega engagement, a Typhon-class destroyer closed with and destroyed the GTD Eisenhower, while the Typhon's air wing decimated the Terran Fourth Fleet. The victory was both symbolically and strategically critical.

During late Reconstruction, the booming Vasudan economy fueled a new fleet, and Vasudan designers faced a choice. The Terrans had elected to build the new Hecate-class, a destroyer that could serve as a fleet carrier. The old Orions would be retained as line combatants. In Terran analysis, future engagements would be resolved primarily by air wings, with corvettes providing escort and artillery support. Destroyers would remain in safety.

Vasudan analysis from the Kames Admiralty placed more weight on decisive action by destroyers on the front lines. A requirement was placed for a modern destroyer to serve as a spearhead, and the Typhon, suffering power grid issues with its new beam weapons, was re-roled as a fleet carrier and second-line destroyer. The role of symbolic supership would be inherited by another design.

Modern doctrine keeps the Typhon as a garrison destroyer, watching over the buzz of Vasudan trade and intrigue. A number of Typhons also serve as arsenal ships, armored with heavy ship-to-ship torpedoes."

4199, "For fifty years running, Vasudan strategists have been trying to wean the Alliance off its addiction to deep-space supply depots. Depots were a major feature of Great War logistics, and a combination of institutional inertia and dependability keeps them in the logistical chain, despite their vulnerability. Even the Shivans exhibited depot behavior. But the post-Vasuda Imperium wants no part of anything that can't pick itself up and run.

One of the most obvious and passive-aggressive elements of this movement is the Vasudans' continued inability to build a decent sentry gun. When the Alliance requested that the Vasudan Navy upgrade the Ankh, they produced the Edjo, a substandard sentry gun by any measure. Although sentry guns are sometimes deployed by warships as close-defense options, the Vasudans seem content to use the ancient Ankh in this role.

Since Capella, the Terran military has moved towards more mobile logistics. A next-generation sentry weapon is definitely in production, but the IVN treats it as a tactical asset and refuses to share."

4200, "The Setekh Advanced Warning and Control System is a vital sensor and communications asset in Vasudan battle groups. It's also an acrimonious political flashpoint. The Terran Charybdis AWACS is cheaper, more compliant with GTVA operational standards, more secure, and better-defended. The Setekh's only real advantages lie in its compartmentalized hull design, which saves it from small fighter weapons, and its superior passive sensors. Yet the IVN insists on manufacturing and deploying the Setekh, insisting it is more suitable for Vasudan purposes.

During post-Capella political tensions, Terran admirals saw this is an intentional snub and a maneuver to deny contracts to Terran manufacturers. Accusations of economic warfare met with an angry response, and today the issue remains sore. In the meantime the Setekh has been upgraded to modern standards, providing the full range of AWACS services - precision jump navigation for friendlies, aspect lock jamming, ECCM, interception and decryption, and limited defensive stealth. Whether the Vasudans have integrated SSM spotting capability remains classified. Terran pilots refer to this vessel as the Steak."

4201, "The Hatshepsut-class destroyer is a flying fortress, one of the finest capital warships ever designed by the Alliance. With an aggressive, backswept prow, a gleaming palace superstructure, and a thunderous fusion drive array, the Hatshepsut looks as good as she fights.

The Hatshepsut was born from the Kames Admiralty's decision to focus the fleet on decisive action against hostile destroyers. The Hatshepsut would mount modern beam weapons, missile silos, and a cutting-edge CIWS grid of flak weapons and anti-fighter beams. She would carry fewer fighters than the Typhon, but still maintain a strong air wing. Her command and informational systems would help Sobek-class corvettes select and prioritize targets. The design requirement was delivered in a series of exemplary Conversations, balancing the appeal of the Hatshepsut project against the prestige and history of rehabilitating the Typhon. As a result, the Hatshepsut team performed solemnly and correctly, avoiding some of the excessive overspecialization typical of excited Vasudans.

One major stumbling block was the ship's hull form. Early designs produced a long-neck, squat-based spaceframe. Designers agreed that the lead destroyer class of the Vasudan Navy could not look like it was about to be beheaded at the altar, so a number of sensor and command systems were moved to an arrowhead bow structure, improving resolution at a slight cost in latency.

During the NTF Rebellion, Hatshepsut-class destroyers leapt into front line combat, jumping from battle to battle and engaging NTF forces with only light escort. The golden ships became icons of Vasudan hope and targets of vendetta for the NTF. The type's formidable flak screen proved an incredible deterrent to fighter attack, and aggressive maneuvering covered for some blind spots in her turret coverage. Hatshepsut captains successfully used the ship's dorsal 255a anti-destroyer beams in circling and topsiding maneuvers, but the Hatshepsut's most fearsome reputation came from tactics against cruisers. Warships such as the Psamtik would safe their main beams, divert the power to subspace drive recharge, and close to destroy NTF vessels with anti-fighter beams, flak, and salvos of fusion mortars. The tactic harmed NTF morale, since it was clear the destroyers were more concerned with getting to the next fight than anything else.

The Psamtik was lost to the second Sathanas juggernaut in a risky deployment, but overall the Hatshepsut-class performed superbly. Production continues to this today, and the latest Hatshepsut Amaru features modern pulse weapons, extended flak range, enhanced command awareness under BACKBREAKER, expanded torpedo magazines with long-range anti-warship capability and anti-fighter interdiction, and slurry heatsinks. The Hatshepsut serves as an elegant front-line combatant alongside modern heavy warships such as the iKhemu-Sek."

4202, "The Seth is a Great War-vintage Vasudan strike craft designed to both protect and destroy bombers. It meets this requirement in particularly Vasudan fashion, slow to keep pace with bombers but equipped with a superb afterburner to chase them. The Seth's incredible Mekhu-Sahr plasma power plant gives it design longevity, leading to significant Vasudan smugness about the value of putting good power systems above all other concerns. Pilots point to the Seth's slim target profile when closing or retreating as key to mastering the craft. Although the Seth's fore-mounted sensors are extremely vulnerable to beam fire, Vasudan pilots take pride in resolving engagements without aspect lock. As a decades-old favorite, the Seth has seen continued production in the maze that is Vasudan private industry. The Set Mace is a popular modern variant."

4203, "Terran pilots often advance two complaints against Vasudan fighters. Their gun placement is poor, and they often cannot survive in a non-permissive environment. Vasudan aces reply that what is most important is the ability to avoid that threat environment in the first place. The Horus light interceptor lines up with both the complaint and the rejoinder. A nimble high-speed attacker, the Horus fares poorly when being shot at but offers skilled pilots a wide range of maneuvering options. At the time of the ship's design, Vasudan tactical philosophy prized the ability to penetrate and disrupt enemy groups, since placing the enemy on the defensive was seen as the key step to victory. The Horus excels in this role, and with modifications to use modern long-range missiles, it can serve as a sniper and skirmisher. Like most Vasudan ships, the Horus remains in production in some capacity, built by Sentences with industrial capability. The Horus-Ur is an example of modern builds."

4204, "A frail little beetle of a dogfighter, the Thoth was once a dreaded sight for Terran pilots. Nimble and armed for only a single mission, the Thoth could prey on Terran fighters and bombers, setting the terms of the engagement and performing quick slashing attacks. In this light the design's widely spaced guns make sense, because repeated pinpoint hits are less important than consistency over multiple attacks. As the lethality of warship point defenses evolved, however, the Thoth's huntings grounds dwindled. The stigma of the Hammer of Light stained the design, but it remained in service as a line space superiority fighter. Terran pilots hoping to master the Thoth must understand Vasudan fighter doctrine, which leverages Vasudan advantages in energy efficiency to feed a more flexible, hit-and-fade fighting style. Prolonged engagements are death, and superb spatial awareness is a must. Vasudan fighters do not forgive error. The Thoth's production history is far more exclusive than most other Great War era designs, and only names tied to the Sahr Corporation participate in Thoth assembly today. The Asten Thoth is the solitary modern variant."

4205, "The post-Capella era has seen an explosion of Vasudan technological, cultural, and economic power. It often reassures Terran observers to know that the Vasudans are also capable of grand and systematic mistakes. After Operation Templar, Vasudan doctrine called for two lines of new fighters to be deployed. Agile, sophisticated light craft would disrupt and outmaneuver enemy formations, while heavy-hitting assault craft would provide killing power. The Pa-anmu Admiralty championed this doctrine, in part because it would satisfy a wide range of industrial concerns, helping stabilize trade and strengthening the Ambassador to Caravans. The Ambassador would use that strength against the Emperor's military advisors, opening opportunities for Pa-anmu's allies. Designed as an affordably high-tech interceptor and dogfighter to cover roles filled by the Horus and Thoth, the Serapis boasted revolutionary controls and incredible agility. The opportunities for artistic expression were intoxicating, and before anyone could outmaneuver the Pa-anmu Admiralty, the Serapis had become an icon of Vasudan progress and prowess. 

The Serapis sacrificed armor and shielding to hit these design targets, and it quickly became apparent that the rise of anti-fighter beam systems threatened the Serapis mission. The fighter was relabeled an interceptor, a feat of linguistic engineering which Pa-anmu hoped would keep pilots away from warship fire envelopes. But the Serapis lacked the linear speed for that role, and was inevitably deployed as a space superiority fighter. Pilots able to rapidly juggle multiple threats while toggling power systems can win stunning performance from the Serapis, but the craft simply needs more survivability. During the Second Incursion the Serapis produced both a number of aces and a large number of casualties. A hasty retrofit to mount the Maxim cannon allowed the Serapis to serve as an anti-warship skirmisher, giving it a new tactical niche. In some respects the Serapis became the lightest heavy assault fighter ever built. Peacetime production in both corporate and private capacity has filled Vasudan space with Serapis fighters, but many have received survivability packages. The current Imperial Vasudan Navy standard is the Isi-Serapis, but the Medjai has already replaced the Serapis with the next-generation Serekh Taa space dominance fighter, and the IVN has terminated procurement."

4206, "The Tauret is a heavy assault fighter whose wildfire success ended an Admiral's career. When the Pa-anmu doctrine called for one light and one heavy fighter to spearhead the Vasudan fleet, engineers and artisans machinated furiously to win the light fighter design. Inevitably, not everyone made it. Worse yet, the Tauret project was given an insultingly generous line of credit and an Ambassador to facilitate political needs. Since lack of constraint invites excess, and excess is death, the team set out to hobble themselves. First, they decided to build a tribute to the Apsu-Hek, a foul-tempered ambush predator from Vasuda Prime. This popular emblem would keep them humble and alert. Second, they sought out Terran funding and engineering talent to avoid drawing on their baited credit line. Successfully tapping Terran strengths while still producing a uniquely Vasudan design would display adaptability and vigor.

Serious problems with the Tauret's power grid nearly sank the project, but the team rose to the occasion, tapping RNI's experts and incorporating Terran solutions. The team settled on a wide, thin spaceframe with excellent thermal characteristics and trivial shield solutions. The problem of volume was solved, again, with humility, using artistic fold algorithms to efficiently pack systems. 

Although the Tauret does suffer power issues, its reactor feeds six gun mounts, a massive arsenal of missiles, and respectable shields and armor. Initial reactions were negative, in part because the Tauret's design made it extremely frustrating to service. But telemetry from the nebula theater established that the Serapis' whirlwind agility couldn't keep it from the scythe, while Tauret squadrons steamrolled Shivan forces with obdurate ferocity. The team paid off their debts, Admiral Pa-anmu graciously stepped aside to pursue the arts, and the Tauret quietly become the heart of Vasudan air wings.

In modern times the Tauret has been supplemented by the Maa-kheru siege fighter, but it remains a vital strength of the IVN."

4207, "Akheton's Ptah stealth reconnaissance craft sprang from the same joint product as the Pegasus stealth fighter. Although the hull configuration and stealth systems are divergent, the craft's final performance is comparable to the Pegasus, with superb agility and carefully baffled emanations. The Vasudan design team paid less attention to target profile and visibility than the Pegasus team, preferring to work with a tested configuration, and as a result the Ptah is far easier to maintain and has nearly twice the operational up-time and sortie rate. Ptah missions provided vital data in the Alliance's attack on the first Sathanas juggernaut.

Ptah postings and deployments have become politically controversial since Capella. The IVN and Medjai both maintain Ptah wings, nominally for strategic reconnaissance. Several IVN admirals have been accused of deploying stealth fighters as political instruments. Conversely, whispers suggest the honorable and heroic Medjai use Ptah sorties to eavesdrop and monitor loyalties. 'The Ptahs know' is an idiom suggesting both that a secret has been breached and that the breach may be proper - or improper, depending on the delivery."

4208, "Mekhu licensed the Triton Dynamics magnetic-stasis matter library system for the Nephthys support ship, which provides field rearmament to Vasudan craft. Loaded with ordnance and a powerful drive, the Nephthys is extraordinarily dangerous to fly. 

Next-generation Vasudan fighters can allegedly manufacture their own ordnance and regenerate damaged systems in the field. Some analysts suggest that this is a myth, as the IVN has continued to maintain and upgrade the Nephthys. The latest block is stealthy and extremely quick. It is possible that onboard sustain systems are limited, or that the IVN simply wants the support ship available as an option for its older craft."

As such, the Vasudan logistics ship lacks medical bays, and due to the fuel processing facilities, is susceptible to devastating internal explosions should it be fired upon."

4227, "NEM.NOW AESHMA

Shivan assault fighter. Performs in the same niche as the Basilisk, but with reduced effect. This emanation was not present in the Lucifer fleet that destroyed the Ancients, but its presence in the nebula does suggest lineage from the same conflict. Effective only in swarm attacks against light targets. Statistical modeling suggests this emanation is moving towards extinction.

Pilot integration is surprisingly high, given the simplicity of flight behavior. Much of the connectivity appears specialized for signals analysis and mathematical transformation. Possible relic behavior from a past role, perhaps as a Nagari amplifier?

Introns strongly favor chain."

4228, "NEM.NOW NEPHILIM

Shivan heavy bomber. Heavily shielded and armored warhead bus. Plainly an effect optimum, with limited sophistication and scale. Warship-heavy tactics with limited escort promote Nephilim emanation, as do large groups of lightly defended targets. The design appears to balance payload against chance of successful delivery.

Pilot integration is extreme. We have no hypothesis: perhaps exaptive.

Introns favor twin, scalar, scrambler, and blink. Primary weapons may approach or exceed the Kayser benchmark."

4229, "NEM.NOW TAURVI

Shivan strike bomber. An apparent compromise between the Nahema and Nephilim types, the Taurvi appears to be a scale optimum, with limited sophistication and effect. High bomber casualties appear to promote Taurvi emanation.

Pilot integration is limited.

Introns favor hot swarm, chain, banshee, scrambler, and blink."

4230, "NEM.NOW NAHEMA

Shivan fighter-bomber and cause of significant consternation. Like the Mara, the Nahema appears to be a traversal design, pushing through a phase space bottleneck into a new array of optimae. Although superficially an effect-sophistication optima, with excellent performance, the Nahema also appeared in tremendous numbers, accounting for a major fraction of Allied casualties during the Second Incursion. We must conclude that it is also promoted by sophistication.

Pilot integration is significant. Nahema pilots are unusually deficient in organs 7F202 and ivHQI.

Introns favor hot swarm, berserker, assassin, standoff, and bruiser."

4231, "NEM.NOW SERAPHIM

Shivan superheavy bomber. We believe the Seraphim is a scale-effect optimum, with limited sophistication. It employs brute force to steamroll its way to objectives, carrying massive payloads. Heavy warship tactics appear to promote Seraphim emanation, as does the destruction of Shivan capital ships.

Pilot integration is extreme, perhaps due to sensory demands. The design's superficial similarity to the Manticore appears to be confounded by ESM capabilities in the limbs.

Introns favor berserker, assassin, standoff, bruiser, and chain."

4232, "NEM.NOW AZRAEL

Shivan transport. Apparently used to ferry Shivan organisms from point to point, the Azrael is optimized for range and subspace agility, classifying it as a scale-effect optimum. Tactical capabilities favor the hypothesis that the Azrael is not designed to survive resistance. Crew behavior obeys a four-hour cycle with chaotic stalls at the end of certain configuration chains.

Promoters unknown, but we believe bottlenecks in Shivan organism movement promote Azraels. Logs recovered from the NTF Iceni record Azrael transports and their crews behaving cognitively, with highly goal-directed behavior.

Ship ecosystem displays limited diversity. System violence obeys replacement homeostasis within half a standard deviation.

Introns include scrambler, picket, scalar, and chain."

4233, "NEM.NOW DIS

Shivan heavy freighter. The Dis displays parturition marks suggesting that it may be a component of a larger device. Apparently built for reliability, the Dis represents a scale optimum, since it could trivially achieve greater speed. Not a tactical factor, but a major strategic target.

Dis appear to be promoted by successful logistics, by Shivan assets short on logistics, and by an excess of Mephisto and Asmodeus population. Crew cycle period unknown. During operations around the Knossos portal, Dis freighters displayed evasive behavior.

Ship ecosystem displays disproportionate diversity. System violence spikes from one to six standard deviations, with hangovers after five+ spikes and a three percent chance of a novel configuration. Feed-forward depends on survival rates.

Introns include scalar, armored, and chain."

4234, "NEM.NOW MEPHISTO

Extremely irritating Shivan light freighter. Displays unconventional morphology for a Shivan specimen. A scale optimum with a slight tendency towards effect, the Mephisto has enough self-defense capability to make a marginal difference in survivability. Pilots report that the craft's cargo provides accidental armor.

Mephisto crews do not obey a consistent behavioral cycle, suggesting the population may somehow be too small to achieve statistical power. Emanation is promoted by attacks on Shivan logistics. Onboard ecosystem violence follows a sine wave with a thirty-minute period. Novel configurations are observed on alternate cycles. Feed-forward has not been observed.

Introns include scrambler, judas, picket, chain, and blink."

4235, "NEM.NOW ASMODEUS

Shivan tactical freighter. Displays the most armor and defensive systems of any Shivan freighter yet encountered, and carries cargo in hardened containers. Apparently an effect optimum in response to threat environments. Significant attrition on Shivan logistics causes emanation of Asmodeus freighters, suggesting procurement is consequential, perhaps due to marginal losses in efficiency.

Asmodeus crews obey a boom-bust behavioral cycle without clear period. There are some mathematical relationships to 1/f noise in neural networks. Booms are characterized by enhanced teleology, transitioning via anaphase and bilateral conflict into a bust period of stereotypic activity along two primary configurations. Novel configurations do not arise in the bust period.

Introns include scrambler, picket, chain, and armor."

4236, "NEM.NOW LILITH

Shivan heavy cruiser and cause of significant consternation. A heavily armored Cain variant, it was a major threat during the Great War and escalated to nightmare during the Second Incursion, where it manifested with a destroyer-grade beam system operating at full power and rate of fire. Adequately defended against strike craft, the Lilith represents an effect-sophistication optimum, although some argue it must be treated as an anomaly or a bottleneck traversal. There is no statistical signal behind Lilith emanations, bolstering the suggestion that it is a form of accident or traversal.

It is possible that the Lilith includes a subspace heat sink akin to the Sathanas main weapons.

Lilith crews obey a strikingly different behavioral cycle than Cain crews, anaphasing into smaller and smaller behavioral groups until all groups but one are extinct. This behavior population repeats the cycle. Each observed vessel has its own characteristic cycle. Hull space diversity is lower than the Cain's, with prominent outgassing from a nanostrain that converts hull isomers.

Introns include berserker, sleeper, scalar, and assassin."

4237, "NEM.NOW RAKSHASA

Shivan strike cruiser. Like many Shivan designs it appears to be a high-alpha beam attacker, but it exhibits an asymmetrical aberration, suggesting either a scale optimization or a missense mutation. Armed with three cruiser-grade beam weapons, the Rakshasa is a significant threat to Allied warships, but as a scale-effect optimum it can be countered with conventional tactics. Pilots should disable the three forward beam weapons with guided missiles as soon as possible. Primary gunfire is ineffective, since the exposed beam emitters are unusually small.

No data on Rakshasa crew behavior is available. Although plenty of ESM information was collected during operations in the nebula, including hull-penetrating scans, only surface exofauna are available for study. Statistical analysis of crew behavior curdles when attempting to bootstrap models of behavioral complexity unless out-of-possibility-space axioms are assumed. Surface exofauna display no particular traits of interest, as the Rakshasa appears inhabited by a conventional Shivan ecosystem of crawlers, killers, anodes, and sparkers.

Introns include berserker, picket, sleeper, armor, scalar, twin, and chain."

4238, "NEM.NOW CAIN

Shivan light cruiser. A Great War-era cruiser that manifested during the Second Incursion with a single cruiser-grade beam weapon, the Cain represents a baseline for Shivan tactical capabilities. Missile launchers and a CIWS beam make the Cain a respectable threat to fighter attack, but it is clearly a scale optimization for environments that reward the presence of multiple light warships. Promoters include large numbers of small Allied warships or small numbers of large Allied warships.

Cain crews cycle through an erratic series of behavioral epochs that appear statistically similar to the dynamics of an eight-body system. Ecosystem violence correlates in an exact negative relationship. Most Cains host a macroorganism of indeterminate origin and considerable size which moves erratically through a space forward of the ship's stern. Feed-forward always occurs, but in almost all cases it is statistically neutral across multiple epochs. Cain crews thus violate historical contingency. 

Introns include berserker, picket, sleeper, armor, scalar, twin, assassin, and chain."

4239, "NEM.NOW DEMON

Shivan line destroyer. Between the Great War and the Second Incursion the type accreted a massive defensive advantage, making it an extremely difficult target to kill. The Demon is lightly gunned for its size, identifying it as a probable scale-effect optimum, with little concern for sophistication. The Demon has excellent hangar facilities. Promoters include Allied corvette-size warships, the destruction of Shivan warships, and a shortage of support for Shivan strike craft. The Demon appears to be suited to environments in which the enemy has numbers but limited firepower.

GTVI is concerned that the Demon is continuing to optimize. Although teleonomic analysis suggests the design is very old, it has recently undergone a transition, and the transition may continue until the destroyer develops a better-defended engine system and enhanced point defenses. The Demon may mature into an 'escort destroyer' with area control capabilities, particularly if the type's missile launchers acquire expanded capability.

Demon crew behavior is subdivided into two primary regions, although these are purely statistical, not spatial. Regions interact only during subspace jumps. After an interaction, shocks disseminate through both regions, priming a set of games that play themselves forward in loosely superConway configurations. In one case a Demon was observed post-jump with only a single observable region, but the observation crew retired due to unease before further data could be collected.

The Demon's internal ecosystem revolves around a set of exotic-atmosphere particle accelerators and cyclotrons. These devices accelerate charged particles to relativistic velocities in fields as powerful as a star's. Near the aft of the cyclotron configuration, six erratic mass objects exchange arcs of charge in a power series. The Shivan organisms termed hulks, melts, plates, and spirals exist in relationship to this environment, although spirals sometimes penetrate as far as the outer hull.

Introns include berserker, standoff, picket, sleeper, armor, and scalar."

4240, "NEM.NOW RAVANA

Shivan strike destroyer. The Ravana is a shock attacker that ambushes targets with its startling subspace agility. Once its drives are exhausted, it can be pinned down and prosecuted in real space. Heavily armed with beam weapons, the Ravana neglects anti-fighter defenses or any real staying power, classifying it as a scale-sophistication optimum, putting technique above broad effect. The Ravana's promoters include the presence of Allied light warships, or heavier warships in isolated positions. As a hit-and-run assassin, the Ravana is a critical threat to Allied morale and force cohesion.

Ravana tactics offered an enormous challenge to the Alliance during the Second Incursion, and perhaps more than any other warship except the Sathanas, it has influenced Alliance doctrine in the years since.

The most notable trait of the Ravana's ecosystem is an intermittent local subspace gate in the ship's core. This appears to be a vestigial or prototypical form of the Sathanas' subspace weapon, and it may have unusual tactical effects, as displayed by the SD Vassago in Capella. A vortex of six to eight hundred flat morphs move in proximity to the gate, forming a turbine or cycloid structure. Population collapses occur on a probabilistic basis, scaling with time since last gate activity and repopulating after a gate event. Crew behavior cycles off this seed function.

Introns include berserker, sleeper, scalar, twin, blink, scrambler, and assassin."

4241, "NEM.NOW LUCIFER

Shivan planetkiller. The Lucifer is the Great War incarnate, an invincible planet-burning nemesis that defined the Shivan threat for an entire generation. Equipped with a sheath shield, two anti-warship beams, and two dual-mode anti-ship/anti-population beams, the Lucifer posed an intractable challenge to Great War tactics and technology. The type is clearly an effect-sophistication optimum, with no concern for scale. Its promoters are unknown, but we suspect that the Lucifer is a heuristic response to a civilization with a highly developed pre-subspace infrastructure, including extensive use of kinetic kill vehicles. Alternately, the Lucifer may not be a product of Shivan response heuristics at all.

The centrality of the Lucifer to Shivan behavior in the Great War led Allied analysts down a blind path, and until the Second Incursion, Allied doctrine prized the ability to engage and destroy a single massive Shivan capital ship.

Recent encounters with a Lucifer-type combatant in unconventional circumstances have highlighted the mutability and power of the Shivan threat. This specimen displayed enhanced power generation, allowing it to operate all its main weapons simultaneously. Startling subspace agility permitted the specimen to engage and disengage with Allied forces in a series of harrying attacks. Analysts believe this Lucifer recognized that it was outmatched and intentionally deactivated its sheath shield in order to pursue a strategy of attritional engagement, exploiting its superior self-repair ability.

It is likely that these behaviors represent cognitive adaptation.

No information on crew dynamics or hull ecosystem are available. Specimen diversity is too low to explore possible introns."

4242, "NEM.NOW TRIDENT

Shivan sentry gun. The Trident is a simple, powerful stationary defense. Armed with two Shivan heavy primaries, the Trident fits a typical profile in which main guns underperform their Allied counterparts. Given its wide dispersal, the Trident appears to be a scale optimization.

During Allied operations in the nebula, scout wings tracked a Rahu gas miner that jumped from depot to depot, extracting Trident platforms from the nebula and caching them in small 'urchin' formations. The purpose of this behavior is unknown.

The Trident possesses a sophisticated onboard intelligence, but it is only vestigially connected to the actual operating mechanism. It appears to be exaptive.

Introns include chain, assassin, standoff, and glare. Limited presence of cold and hot swarm."

4243, "NEM.NOW BELIAL

Shivan heavy sentry gun. Armed with four heavy Shivan primaries, the Belial defends key Shivan installations and depots. We describe the Belial as an effect optimum. Combat pilots respect the Belial more than any other sentry gun, and tactics prescribe long-range attack with guided missiles.

If the primary weapons of Shivan craft ever begin expressing more power and accuracy, Allied pilots will face a major threat.

Belial sentry guns were the object of a minor conspiracy within GTVI during the Second Incursion. Analysis of ESM records detected a pattern in the bearing and intensity of Belial targeting sensors, as if the Shivans were using them as communication buoys. A scramble to collect and examine Belial specimens led to the loss of a combat squadron at the hands of a Dragon emanation. Later teleonomic analysis of these transmissions inferred information content, but it matches no known Shivan emission.

Introns include chain, assassin, standoff, cold swarm, and glare."

4244, "NEM.NOW RAHU

Shivan gas miner. Heavily armored for a non-combat spacecraft, the Rahu gathers and processes nebula gas for use in Shivan drive systems. Rahu types explode spectacularly when destroyed, so combat pilots should use caution. Promoters include Shivan combat operations and Shivan logistical deficits.

Our models suggest that the Rahu should be lightly armored, as a scale optimum. The design may be pre-adapted as a result of past pressure on Shivan mining operations in the nebula.

Rahu crew behavior is an example of outright physical violence among Shivan organisms. The crew selects target members, who are attacked, dismembered, and integrated with components from other dismembered targets. After a convalescence period, the resulting novel phenotypes return to default crew behavior. A small fraction of crew organisms are repeatedly targeted, creating chimeric specimens with multiple limbs and convulsive, maladaptive mass. Target selection seems to crawl along a Markov-like similarity selection from past targets.

Onboard ecosystem diversity typically includes a colony of melters and spirals arranged along field lines in the fractionation array. These organisms are hunted by small predator morphs called jointers, which induce fatal communication by linking two prey organisms.

Introns include chain and picket. Some specimens confusingly display glare introns."

4245, "NEM.NOW MOLOCH

Shivan corvette. Very lightly armed for a ship-to-ship combatant, the Moloch behaves like a pocket destroyer, launching Shivan strike craft against Allied objectives. This makes it a limited battlefield presence on its own, but a major strategic nuisance. We designate the Moloch as a scale-sophistication optimum, placing agility above simple tactical effect. Promoters include Allied force concentrations, Allied convoy and fighter operations, and the presence of light Allied warships.

The Moloch is armed with three cruiser-grade antiship beams, a strong anti-fighter suite, and compartmentalized hull design that requires major firepower to kill. It has an excellent subspace drive even by Shivan standards, operating with accuracy and alacrity even close to disruptive presences like the Knossos portal. The warship's forward gun is a conventional plasma weapon, but it possesses a bottle control apparatus like a beam weapon, suggesting either a missense mutation or the development of a novel guided plasma weapon.

Crew behavior obeys the Kaleo-Mikala law, with total feed forward and historical contingency. Stable configurations orbit a behavioral attractor which we tentatively attribute to one of two large sessile masses inhabiting spaces along the ship's spine. Generations occur at thirty-minute intervals, with crossover between configurations provided by outbursts of symbolic violence. Generation turnover is complete and instantaneous. The broad trend of behavioral configurations represents an approach-and-flee cycle. 

Introns include twin, standoff, glare, hot swarm, scalar, blink, and scrambler."

4246, "NEM.NOW SATHANAS

Shivan juggernaut and special weapon platform. The apocalyptic messenger of the Second Incursion, the Sathanas was believed to be the single command platform coordinating Shivan behavior in the nebula - until more than eighty Sathanas juggernauts converged on Allied space, where they collapsed the Capella star with a subspace weapon, triggering an artificial supernova. This punctured a number of assumptions about Shivan behavior and strategic organization, marking a significant turning point in both Allied doctrine and human-Vasudan history.

The Sathanas' primary tactical armament is a quartet of forward-mounted superheavy beams that violate local thermodynamics. These weapons can mission kill an Allied destroyer in a single salvo. We believe the Sathanas sinks heat directly into a subspace domain. The Sathanas is heavily armored and defended from fighter attack by hull defenses and an air wing.

Frighteningly, we believe the Sathanas represents a scale-sophistication optimum. A juggernaut optimized for battlefield effect would have superior weapons coverage and a more diversified armament. Instead, the Sathanas appears to be a shock platform, adapted to penetrate blockades, ambush vital targets, and deploy its main weapon.

The Sathanas' strategic capability lies in its powerful subspace weapon. Fired through the same emitters as the beam weapons, this weapon engineers the subspace domain to variable effect. Imputed capabilities include node engineering, jump capture, and, when used in concert with other Sathanas juggernauts, the forced supernova of stars.

We have no information on Sathanas promoters or introns. The craft is clearly pre-adapted, but it may represent a Shivan strategic asset, responsive not to a particular threat species but to broader life cycle requirements. Sathanas behavior during the late Second Incursion was highly goal-directed and intentional.

The craft's internal ecosystem is cause for major alarm. The Sathanas' interior volume hosts an environment nicknamed the 'nightmare turbine', which appears to be coupled both to the juggernaut's tactical capabilities and to Shivan strategic behavior. Within this environment, structures ranging from the quantum level up through macrofauna and semiotic or conceptual realms engaged in destructive competition, producing lethally optimized variants and symbols. The system was highly energetic, with input from the Sathanas' primary power. Output seemed to serve as a seed function or driver for Shivan behavior.

The ability to engage and destroy Sathanas juggernauts in large numbers is a primary goal of Allied doctrine."

The Kalki-class superjuggernaut was encountered by Allied forces in unconventional circumstances. Analysis must proceed from very limited data.

The Kalki appears to be a command and control vessel, which defies our understanding of Shivan behavior and organization.

Because the Dragon is rarely encountered, we suspect it is somehow costly or consequential to procure. We believe that Allied tactics focused on groups of effective strike craft will cause Dragon emanation.

Pilot organism integration is nearly total. Distinctions are arbitrary.

Introns suggest that groups of Dragons may develop a number of swarm behaviors, including enhanced individual capability as swarm size degrades, i.e. hot swarm, or reduced individual capability as swarm size degrades, i.e. cold swarm.

Tactics that favor point assets, without escort or disruption to break up incoming wings, will promote Basilisk emanation.

We have much better data on the Mara than most other design emanations, which makes it a point of enhanced investigation.

The Mara appears to be promoted by enemy tactical sophistication. Its flexibility allows it to perform in the space superiority, escort, and heavy assault roles. We are concerned that the design may represent a bottleneck bypass into a new set of optimae. Pilot integration is moderate.

Introns are extremely diverse, suggesting long lineage. Hot swarm, berserker, banshee, and standoff appear most probable."

Technologically sophisticated life is apparently common in the galaxy - it arises frequently, and it has done so for some time now, at least in the cosmological span. Why, then, is the galaxy empty - Why do we find no von Neumann probes propagating through the subspace network? Where is the life that must have come before us?

We should inhabit a teeming universe, a bazaar of wonders, a cosmic ecumenopolis overflowing with civilization. The stars and galaxies around us should by all rights have been restructured to the needs of unimaginably sophisticated engineers. Technology self-catalyzes, and that catalysis has had time to flourish. The civilizations of the universe should, by now, have conquered reality itself.

We find no such wonder. Our cosmos is silent.

Certainly the Shivans provide one answer to this question - a great filter that annihilates spacefaring civilizations. But what if there was a time before the Shivans? What happened to the first life in the universe, the children of the dawn?

4336, "The Sanctus class cruiser is a ship with a troubled development history.

In the 2350's the future shape of the Federation space military was proposed in BULWARK's Strategic Imperative Paper, describing a garrison force operating inside a highly developed supply and intelligence infrastructure. Federation warships would be supply-hungry, but capable of ferocious high intensity combat to contain any invasion force. The requirements for the Future Fleet Cruiser were heavily influenced by this document, and a variety of imaginative doctrines were proposed by competing defense contractors.

The Sol element of Han-Ronald Corporation eventually won the contract to build the Sanctus, drawing upon its years of cruiser design experience to conceptualise a hybrid cruiser-freighter. Deploying a wing of Sanctus cruisers alongside a Solaris destroyer would relieve the logistical strain of deploying these behemoths in combat, while providing area defense and fire support for the destroyer's air wing. Strike capability was already filled by the Purusha frigate - cruisers were anticipated to be deployed as part of a battlegroup.

The Sanctus turned out to be an unhappy compromise. The ship was substantially larger than any previous cruiser in service, yet its weapons barely outstripped that of a Fenris. Cargo space was limited by the need to host the ship's own weapons and combat systems, and though critical spaces were sufficiently protected, the cargo hold had a desultory armour scheme that left it vulnerable to a determined attack. Due to ongoing trade route raids by Gaian Effort forces, the role of the cruiser was switched from the relatively supported fleet cruiser role to that of convoy escort, to which the Sanctus was poorly suited.

In the immediate aftermath of the Gaian Effort campaign, Admiral Calder began an extensive refit program to all Sanctus cruisers to replenish Third Fleet's strength. The cargo hold was removed and armour improved around vulnerable areas. Light torpedo launchers, new point defense and burst flak weaponry were added. The result was a tactically flexible weapons platform, powerful against strikecraft - if somewhat undergunned against larger warships. Throughout the course of the war with the GTVA, Earth and Mars would began a similar process of upgrading Sanctus cruisers and deploying them as attack cruisers. It was not until the second refit of the Sanctus where deficiencies in firepower and armour were finally addressed and the design would reach its full potential as a line combatant."

They are capable of limited torpedo strikes against soft (or, when supported, hard) targets and have adequate point defenses to handle bomber attack. The Custos is notable for its highly modular design, a quality which made it economical in peacetime and flexible in wartime. The directive to prepare Custos units for front-line combat led to a crash upgrade program that enhanced the Custos' agility and electronic warfare capabilities in order to give it a fighting chance against beam attack and heavy assault wings armed with swarm missiles. Orders were also placed for Custos spaceframes modified from the keel up for expanded capabilities, but these craft were apparently never produced.

4347, "The Purusha was a frigate in service in the Federation Navy.

In 2356 the Strategic Imperative Paper was released by the military intelligence group BULWARK. This was a landmark document that had two aims: to identify areas of improvement from previous fleet doctrines and to deduce what would be required of the nascent Federation Navy. The Paper was the harbinger of a period of volatility in warship design. The defense industry had been long constrained by economic depression and military collapse - it now had the means and mandate to implement radical new doctrine. In this period several revolutionary new concepts were birthed, some more successful than others.

One such revolution was the frigate. This new line of warship was conceptualised as a strike platform to occupy a space within the yawning chasm of capability that had existed between cruisers and destroyers. Frigates would be better armed and armoured than cruisers, but cheaper to build and operate than a capital ship. These new warships would have the teeth to engage major hostile assets in battle, but not be so singularly valuable that their potential would be unrealised by skittish admirals. The incorporation of a small fighter hangar into the design was debated at great length by the Admiralty, with the decision being made not to sacrifice armour and firepower. Fighter carrying capacity would be left to the destroyer flagships as per previous doctrines.

The Purusha emerged as the first of her kind and for a time she was the pinnacle of post-GTA naval power in Sol. The first Purusha rolled out of the dockyards in 2363, and at a stroke rendered every other combat warship in Sol obsolete. She had more firepower than any cruiser that came before her, armed with mass drivers and heavy antimatter torpedoes. Utilisation of supply-hungry but energy-efficient ammunition-based armaments allowed the majority of her reactor output to be allocated to engine performance. She was twice as fast as the venerable Fenris strike cruiser despite the frigate's superior tonnage, armour and firepower.

The Purusha was extensively deployed against the Gaian Effort, suffering significant losses during Third Fleet's campaign in the system outer rim. With the introduction of the Karuna, she was reclassified as a light frigate and phased out of frontline duty. No Purushas remain in the order of battle of the Federation's three line fleets. Most hulls of the class were decommissioned and yarded in case of emergency reactivation. A few demilitarized Purushas still fly as fast couriers for private interests."

Utilising swarm tactics, Gef strike fighters would overwhelm Sanctus military freighters and Purusha light frigates with impunity. Facing mounting shipping losses, the Admiralty outlined their requirements for a next-generation frigate. The exigencies of the conflict had affirmed the criticality of a ubiquitous fighter escort. It was not enough for fleet destroyers to deploy wings to support warships in the field - frigates would need to bring their own fighters to battle. Imperatives by DARK CLOUD and BULWARK to the Federation College of War refined the design - the new frigate would need to run her own escort as well as threaten hard targets in the event of Shivan incursion. 

The Karuna frigate carrier turned out to be a veritable fortress. Up to eight fighters could be fielded in the forward hangar, and her powerful suite of flak and rapid-fire cannons proved devastating against hostile strikecraft. Three VLS silos supplementing a forward battery of gauss cannons and mass drivers gave her the teeth to engage hostile warship assets. She was swift and maneuverable, able to quickly respond to threats in a fluid battlespace. The Karuna was the right ship built at the right time - a sorely needed solution to the chronic problem of maintaining security in a fractious post-Isolation system.

Karunas are widely deployed in the current conflict with the GTVA and form the offensive backbone of all three Fleets."

With the GTVA specializing in rapid beam strikes, it has become apparent that the standard weapons loadout carried by the frigate, geared towards peacekeeping duties and attrition warfare, is insufficient to deliver sufficient counterfire in direct combat. This proposed upgrade, tentatively called the Karuna Mark 2, is intended to address these deficiencies by replacing several of the original's Flak cannons with Mass Drivers, as well as installing launch systems for the Slammer Area Denial System. Active armour belts at critical points have been improved, and crew requirements have been lowered through a greater use of automated systems than previously thought practical. However, implementing this upgrade to existing Karuna hulls currently requires a long stay in a fleet yard, a luxury the UEF cannot afford given the fleets' operational status at this time."

She was an evolution of the frigate warship line that began with the Purusha and was refined with the Karuna. The next-generation heavy warship concept was first realised with the powerful but ultimately aborted dreadnought prototype. Admiral Calder's Murugan Project aimed to address the deficit in offensive firepower by focusing on a main battery of mass drivers. This contrasted with the defense-oriented Solaris destroyers with their massive Apocalypse swarms. When the audacity of the Murugan precluded further investment in dreadnought development, the Heavy Frigate project gravitated towards economical tried-and-tested designs.

The Narayana heavy frigate eventuated from this, essentially taking design elements of the Karuna and expanding on them. The hull was lengthened to accommodate a greater fighter and shuttle hangar capacity. Mass driver and gauss cannon firepower was augmented and concentrated forward. This meant the frigate's entire offensive fire could be brought to bear at a single target, in contrast to the Murugan whose turrets divided her firepower across multiple vectors. Point defenses were weaker than the Karuna's as a result of the expanded main battery but it was anticipated the Narayana's greater fighter carrying capacity would make up for the shortfall.

The heavy frigate was built when the only hardened targets the Federation Navy had engaged were old System Rim fortresses commandeered by the Gaian Effort, with the occasional armed mining ship pushed to service as a capital ship. When the GTVA launched its invasion of Sol, Narayanas proved completely inadequate to counter the advanced beam weaponry of TEI corvettes. Many frigates were lost during the opening stages of the conflict. In what would later be memorialised as a particularly inspired act, Admiral Netreba of Mars' Second Fleet authorised a massive refit of all Narayana frigates, installing specialised artillery weapons capable of engaging hostile targets at extreme range. Federation forces have since won several key engagements where the frigate's artillery forced Alliance warships to withdraw from combat.

The refit Narayana would serve with great effectiveness throughout the conflict with the Alliance. However, the long-range guns took up space otherwise occupied by fighter hangar facilities - the artillery frigate would no longer be able to house fighters within its diminished hangar. Because of this they would prove to be vulnerable to strikecraft attacks, shock jumps and cruiser groups, which aggressive, dynamic Alliance commanders were able to exploit ruthlessly."

The Federation fleet had a powerful defensive core in the Solaris flagships but was brittle on the offensive. In 2376 Admiral Calder's Jovian Rim Fleet had routed the Gaian Effort in the decisive Battle of Eris Base, ending a protacted and costly campaign against the militant organisation. However, the conflict had exposed shortcomings of Navy assets, specifically the undergunned and underarmoured Purusha light frigate and the modern but fragile Karuna frigate carrier. A paradigm shift in warship design was called for by the Admiralty and several proposals for a next-generation warship were considered.

Admiral Calder's concept was as bulldog as the man himself. He envisioned a dreadnought suited to his aggressive, unsubtle practice of warfare. The ship's dimensions would approach destroyer-scale, but the ship would forgo a fighter hangar for increased armour. The Murugan sported a bruising main battery of frigate-scale mass drivers in four triple-barreled turrets. Long range strike capability came in the form of a pair of spinal gauss cannons. A suite of point defense turrets provided antifighter fire and warhead interception. The Murugan was a brute of a ship, all muscle, built to brawl against cruisers and prevail.

Fresh from victory over the Gefs, Calder utilised his considerable clout to push for the allocation of resources towards the Murugan. Construction of a prototype vessel was commenced at the Bradbury Fleetyards, but was halted barely two months into construction when computer simulations identified problems with the ship's combat effectiveness. The ship was essentially undergunned for her size and role, and the design was revisited and refined. The ship's primary battery was doubled, supplemented by a new secondary battery of cruiser-grade mass drivers. Four torpedo launchers were installed, each capable of firing a swarm of Apocalypse antimatter missiles. Finally, the point defense suite was enhanced with several flak turrets. The firepower of the refit design would come close to exceeding that of the Solaris-class destroyers.

At this stage the budget had blown out to five times the initial estimate and construction was considerably behind schedule. It would be years before the first Murugan would roll out of the yards and Third Fleet needed to replenish its losses from the campaign against the Gefs. The Murugan project was put on indefinite hold, and resources would instead be directed towards the Narayana heavy frigate."

They represented a massive investment of resources and manpower that, according to critics, was fundamentally unnecessary. Designed by an ad-hoc committee of the Federation's best engineering and tactical thinkers and built at Mars' Bradbury Fleet Yards, these enormous warships seemed like answers to a nonexistent problem.
There are currently 3 ships of this class in service: the Solaris under Admiral Byrne, the Eris under Admiral Netreba, and the Toutatis under Admiral Calder. They each serve as both flagships and primary strategic deterrents for their respective fleets.
The Solaris class' primary firepower is delivered via 12 Hwacha Mk 2 missile launchers, each capable of firing up to 4 missiles before a reload cycle. Secondary armament is comprised of fast-firing mass drivers designed to kill enemy turrets, supplemented by a comprehensive suite of point defense and Flak Turrets.
They also carry a sizable fighter complement, befitting their role as carriers. While the Solaris destroyers themselves have barely seen combat in the war, their impact on the strategic situation is enormous, and the actions of their fighter wings are critical in the Federation's defensive efforts. Each Solaris serves as a single-handed 'fleet in being', deterring a crushing GTVA assault."

While smaller than the old Orion class destroyers, they are faster and pack a much greater punch. Armed with several point defence turrets, Gauss Cannons and heavy missile batteries, they are a deadly threat to any ship that engages them in battle. Ideally suited to independent intrasystem duties, they have been instrumental in maintaining peace and order within Sol.

Long before the Custos was deployed for fleet duty, Fedayeen engineers were researching ways to overcome the prohibitive power requirements of a capital-class shield. Using data gathered from the Lucifer, the only shielded capital ship encountered, the first prototype capital-class shield generator was constructed and implemented into a modified Custos hull. Outfitted with a staggering array of primary cannons as well as a stripped-down Varunastra mass driver, the Custos-X's primary mission was to infiltrate and assault Kostadin assets in the vast unchartable wasteland of the Kuiper Belt."

The base model is unarmed and incapable of atmospheric operations and subspace travel, although its long service life has led to the creation of a multitude of variants, many of which have some or all of these capabilities. The Mercury is one of the most common vessels of any type in the Terran military and civilian fleets.

Built by the Gaian Effort Kostadin Cell, still faithful to the ecoterrorist agenda of its leader, the MacDuff began its life as one of the modified mining ships that ferried Fringe Alliance citizens to their new homes in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. The Gaian Effort grew out of Reverend Iain MacDuff's generosity in these days, and, in turn, the warship Morena MacDuff grew out of the gradual disintegration of MacDuff's dream.

As those who had turned to MacDuff for protection and salvation splintered into numerous cells, many diverging from his agenda, MacDuff armed the Morena and used it as an enforcer. Over the decades, Kostadin Cell has expanded the ship by accretion, adding new armor, weapons, and power systems in a cascading and almost biological growth. Confined to a few carefully plotted jump points by the subspace hazards of the Solar periphery, the MacDuff looms as a symbol of Kostadin Cell's hardline politics and MacDuff's madness.

The vessel is named after MacDuff's beloved wife, whose remains are rumoured to be enshrined deep in the bowels of the warship. With the Reverend MacDuff now nearing 150 years old, his ship - patchwork, unpredictable, barely sustained by constant attention - seems a fitting totem. Her current status is unknown, as the increasingly cultish Kostadin Cell protects her reverentially."

No, BULWARK never put me up to this. They've been silent since day one. Did I tell you I had to use my own leave time for this trip? I haven't seen my family in weeks. 

The problem you know is the budget black hole - resources go in, nothing gets out. Where is it all going? We're funding paper crews, ships that don't exist. Entire frig- and crurons disappearing from FLEETNET. I asked for tracking help but MIDWINTER hasn't got back to me. I don't even know where she's based nowadays.

So I told you I followed the paper trail of Calder's white elephant all the way to Saab. Everything was legit. Saab shipyard recieved the Murugan hull and towed her away to Elis for scrap. After that it all gets fuzzy. Anyone who gets to Elis graveyard looking for answers gets turned away at the door. I don't think the admiral even knows what happened to his pet project.

So I went digging. I can't find anything on BULWARK, so does that rule out Fleet involvement? There must be someone here who knows what the fuck is going on. Cross referenced with FEDAYEEN but nothing came up. DARK CLOUD seems superficially involved but there's nothing specific anywhere.  Maybe an offshoot Shivan project? Doesn't sound right though, they've never been interested in military resources.

And the headache is, this black hole needed a half-built battleship for some reason. It's gotta be destroyer-scale. Any smaller and they'd just dig up one of the FL hulls in storage. No one's going to miss an old frigate.

The weapon could not outperform the Subach HL-7.

Ballistic weapons fell out of favor during the 14 Year War because they underperformed compared to jacketed plasma weapons, and the rise of fighter-grade shields seemed to put the last bullet through the concept. But the rise of warship-grade beam weapons, combined with newer, more sophisticated rounds, created a requirement for long-range attacks against warship hulls and turrets. The Maxim now serves as a cornerstone of Alliance tactics, with heavy assault wings trained to mob targets and strip their turrets from beyond their range of reply. Enormous ammunition and power requirements and the need for barrel changes after every 4000 rounds fired prevent the Maxim from being deployed aboard warship turrets in most cases, and in any case, the design relies on the firing platform's ability to reposition. Maxim rounds shear apart ineffectively on shields.

Although described to pilots as a powerful, short-range particle cannon, the Kayser is in fact more like a quantum safecracker. The device fires constellations of subatomic particles entangled and suspended in a state of quantum uncertainty. When the constellation strikes a target, an unknown interior feedback mechanism collapses the constellation into a state lethally attuned to the target's structure. Damage is inflicted by sprays of virtual particles that emerge from the quantum vacuum. Shivan weapon examples used this mechanism, but ineffectively, and Alliance technicians were able to apply a set of filters which clamp the possible outputs to a narrower range.

4603, "The SCWS-3 Scalpel is the third member of the Shekar-Johnson product line purpose-built for the Federation navy. A subsystem disruptor designed for customs duty, the Scalpel is an ion pathshock weapon that delivers powerful current down a plasma stream, compromising even Faraday-caged systems. Good range allows the user to engage enemy turrets from a relatively safe distance, but the Scalpel cannot outrange Alliance anti-fighter beam weapons. Its secondary role is as a shield breaker, it can inflict a crippling charge differential across the shield surface, on par with the GTVA's Circe. As a result, some pilots use it as a dogfight weapon. At one point during the Isolation, the Scalpel was the standard-issue weapon on Federation fighters, but the outbreak of the recent conflict ended this policy."

4606, "Information on this weapon is compartmentalized, code HAWKING, dissemination NOFORN. Check clearance: cleared. The SCWS/SA1 Sidhe is a collapsed molybdenum shrapnel weapon that accelerates a canister of six submunitions until an onboard fuse triggers separation. Submunitions deploy in a conical spread to increase hit probability and overmatch reactive armor systems designed to defeat single penetrations. Each submunition carries a coil-flash EMP charge to defeat shield systems. Although the Sidhe was originally designed as a payload for warship-grade gauss cannons, pilots using the fighter-mounted variant began fusing the Sidhe canisters to detonate on launch, creating a devastating short-range weapon. The Ainsarii stealth fighter can fire four Sidhe canisters simultaneously, wreaking havoc on small targets in dogfight ranges. The Sidhe is an excellent snapshot weapon to resolve engagements against maneuverable foes."

The Cavalier is a packaged plasma weapon of remarkable derivation and effect. Technologically, it is a clear descendant of the GTW-5 Prometheus cannon, firing laser-excited high-energy plasma in a magnetic bottle. Unlike the Prometheus, its shot packaging has been optimized for performance against shields, and it deals nearly 50% more damage per shot due to improved fire control systems - similar to those used in the Rapier weapon - and superior raw power."

The heavy beam cannon is integral to Shivan shock-jump tactics, and provides a near-insurmountable advantage in line engagements. It is capable of near-continuous fire, and yet, frighteningly, its power requirements are so low that it can be mounted on modified cruisers. Ships carrying these weapons should be considered priority targets for disarming strikes."

They are capable of continuous fire without overheating. It is unclear where the heat goes, leading GTI analysts to the unsettling conclusion that these weapons are not compatible with thermodynamics as we understand it. It is possible that waste heat is somehow shunted into subspace, or that the Shivans use quantum sleight-of-hand to process the heat out of local space. No allied warship can survive engagement with one of these weapons.

4680, "During its engagement with the Sathanas juggernaught, the GTVA Colossus overloaded its 'Crypt Hammer' beam emitters, forcing additional power to the magnetic bottle and increasing plasma core feed rates. Overloading beam weapons is not standard practice on GTVA warships, but as confidence in power grid and heat sink handling has increased, trained crews have begun drilling on tactical weapon overloads. This comes at the cost of subspace engine recharge and emitter endurance."

Reliable, accurate, easy to maintain, and highly robust, the Crypt Hammer remains a favorite of Terran warship crews. It provides the main tactical power of Orion and Hecate combatants. It has one of the lowest failure rates of any GTVA weapons system, but it produces copious heat and its mountings are bulky."

Mekhu Enterprises science teams focused on maximizing beam effect rather than power, using an arcing magnetic bottle to cut a path across the target.

Firing caseless, smart-fused, electrically ignited explosive shells at barely subnuclear yields, the flak gun damages targets by fragmentation and blast. Modern flak guns can sustain area suppression barrages for minutes at a time before their ammunition is depleted.

Ten years after Capella, this investment produced the pulse cannon, a radical improvement over older weapons like the Houndtooth. With vastly enhanced range and velocity, the Hellstar Pulse Cannon fires heavy plasma pulses out to 2.4 kilometers, giving modern warships - including the Erebus-class destroyer - a third heavy weapons system to complement beam weapons and torpedoes. Potent against both shields and hull, the Type 1 Hellstar can smash fighters in a few hits and deal serious damage to warship targets. Sahr Corporation scientists are still attempting to lock down the magnetic bubble to improve the weapon's accuracy."

Mounted on most next-generation Alliance warships as a battery weapon, the 'Aurora Wake' supplements its own dedicated reactors with feeds from the ship's drives. Prone to overheating, this system is perhaps the most cantankerous of the next-generation beams. Mass issues encountered while mounting the beam on the Chimera corvette led to that vessel's relatively thin armor plating. Nonetheless, the 'Aurora Wake' was the first beam weapon that enabled the GTVA to emulate Shivan-style shock jump tactics."

4752, "'Helicon Spear' Beam System"

4753, "Anti-fighter beams have always been an afterthought in GTVA weapons development.  Big, flashy anti-ship beam projects invariably take the lion's share of engineering talent and funding, and what remains is typically taken for conventional weapon systems.  Even private defense contractors seem to see no future in the concept.  This, more than any engineering bottleneck, is why the Phalanx anti-fighter beam has remained unchanged for the last 25 years, even as the ships it is mounted on and the weapons it is mounted alongside grow ever more capable.  

While the growing deficiency has been noted by ship captains, political support for a replacement never materialized.  Instead, prospects for a replacement came from a different source: a wager between two engineering teams at the Ophion Field Dynamics Laboratory in Beta Aquilae.  While the specifics of this wager are not recorded, both teams set to work on reviving a dead field.

The obvious thing to expect was something along the lines of 'Phalanx, but better', or a version of ULTRA that addressed its reliability and targeting problems.  Instead, the design team produced a fascinating weapon.  Using grossly oversized capacitors feeding an emitter no larger than that of the Phalanx, the 'Helicon Spear' Dual-Purpose Beam System is by far the most compact anti-warship beam ever designed.  A weapon of frighteningly high power for its size, but with a dynamic beam envelope agile enough to track fast-moving strikecraft and ordnance. 

The weapon's ravenous appetite places a lot of strain on power systems, and because of the beam's high yield, it is very sensitive to changes in its comparatively lower intensity magnetic bottle.  Without a full lock (an uncertain prospect against rapidly maneuvering targets), the beam envelope tends to ablate on shield matrices, resulting in partial power discharge before impact with the hull.  This issue will remain until the installation of more powerful magnetic field stabilizers, ideally mounted on a full turret assembly. "

4754, "BABeam"

4755, "Vishnan Beam Weapons"

4756, "Vishnan beam weapons, like those of the Alliance and the Shivans, are relativistic plasma weapons. Unlike their Shivan and Alliance counterparts, Vishnan beams use a strip of gravitationally altered space-time, rather than a magnetic bottle, to guide the beam to its target. Gravity is a significantly less powerful force than electromagnetism, so the power requirements should be enormous and the efficiency reduced, but Vishnan beam weapons nonetheless outperform our own. Hasty examination of Vishnan warship debris suggests that they lack internal heatsinks. Scientists hypothesize that the Vishnans may sink heat through standing subspace gates. Although Vishnan beam weapons are powerful and frequently outperform Shivan equivalents, they do not seem capable of the extreme scalability that allows the Shivans to generate weapons like the Sathanas juggernaught's main guns.

Design was already in progress when the Lucifer detonation collapsed the node, and as the GTA in Sol lapsed into irrelevance, the program faltered. When the newborn Federation issued its first requirement for a tactical and patrol combatant, the Sanctus cruiser, the Uller was resurrected from Han-Ronald archives to provide light point defense. The Uller improves on older Djinn and Houndtooth designs primarily through improved power draw and heat generation. However, the Uller Block 0 does offer a slight damage improvement over the older Houndtooth. More impressively, Han-Ronald engineers were able to extend and improve the magnetic bottle, increasing the weapon's range and speed drastically. Unfortunately for Han-Ronald, these weapons continued to underperform against shielded fighter attack, and were rapidly rendered obsolete by new Jovian point defense weapons. They continue to serve in a limited fashion aboard Federation military and civilian shipping, primarily as antiwarhead defenses, where their three-kilometer range and pinpoint accuracy is a boon to early bomb intercept.

It was intended to serve as the primary weapon of a new generation of warships, but in spite of vast improvements over its predecessor - doubled damage, enhanced range and projectile speed - the fundamental concept of the Great War-era plasma weapon was obsolete. These heavy plasma weapons can engage targets out to nearly three kilometers, but they have largely been relegated to the secondary point defense role aboard some Federation warships and civilian spacecraft. The Sanctus cruiser, one of the Federation's oldest warship designs, still uses these weapons as part of its armament, relying on their low power draw and heat footprint to supplement its railguns and more modern point defense weapons."

The Aindraastra suppresses an area with a spread of caseless nuclear-yield flak munitions. Ineffective against warheads, but devastating against fighters and bombers, the Aindraastra makes a decisive contribution to Federation warships' reputation as fighter-killers."

4772, "CG-2a Varunastra-A Mass Driver"

4773, "The mass driver variant of the Varunastra gun is the short-range, brute-force element of the UEF's direct-fire warship weapons systems. Firing explosive-tipped ceramic rounds, the Varunastra-A can inflict punishing damage to corvettes and destroyers alike.

4775, "The long-range Gauss Cannon variant of the Varunastra gun is one of the few tactical advantages Federation warships have in the current conflict. Excellent range and precision compensate for laughably small damage from a depleted uranium penetrator, allowing Federation captains to disable enemy beam weapons, turrets, and subsystems from a safe distance before closing to attack. This tactical flexibility is a major deterrent to simple assault by the GTVA. Hecate destroyers in particular are critically vulnerable to this form of long-range salvo attack. Karuna frigates routinely use their Gauss Cannons to harass targets, forcing GTVA ships to break their formations and charge or be rendered ineffective. Stormrider Systems fabricated the electromagnetic and electronic components of the weapon, while Consolidated Material Dynamics worked on the materials science elements of the design."

When fired in large volleys, the Cyclops provides good probability of hit even against modern warships, but the threat environment has grown so hostile to bombers that it is clear the Cyclops' time is limited. The special issue Helios antimatter bomb is largely restricted to anti-Sathanas FIREBREAK units, and Cyclops procurement has run so rampant that the GTVA sometimes sells consignments of older warheads off for use as mining tools despite the security risk. The Myrmidon space superiority fighter's Block 6 upgrade enables it to serve as a fighter-bomber, carrying Cyclops torpedoes.

4991, "Like the Jackhammer and Sledgehammer, the GES-101 Apocalypse is an anti-ship torpedo empowered by the antimatter harvest of the Federation's Mercury-orbit stations. Enormous antimatter reserves have allowed the manufacture of tens of thousands of Apocalypse warheads. Unlike their fighter-borne cousins, the Apocalypse is warship-launched, and a proportionally greater component of its mass is devoted to range and speed as opposed to yield. Fired in salvoes of four, the Apocalypse gives Federation frigates and destroyers all-aspect, 360 by 360-degree engagement capability at excellent range. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the Apocalypse is the single greatest reason why the Federation fleet has not yet been shattered. GTVA warship commanders and fighter pilots have struggled to effectively screen their own ships from incoming Apocalypse flights, and although their yield is not astounding, they very effectively destroy subsystems and turrets. Larger versions of the Apocalypse torpedo with uprated engines are used by Narayana frigates as artillery weapons. They are also routinely carried on Solaris class Destroyers as main armament."

4992, "Hydra"

4993, "GES-112 Hydra"

4994, "The Hydra is a novel torpedo specially designed by Wartime Special Projects to penetrate point defenses and fighter screens. Based on the same saturation concept as the Warhammer swarm torpedo carried by bombers and the Sanctus class cruiser, the Hydra is a two-stage weapon that differs somewhat in execution. The first stage is a warhead bus missile based on the Apocalypse missile frame. The second stage is a quartet of guided submunitions. While these are less effective than the standard Apocalypse torpedo, they are also much, much harder to intercept. Hydra missiles are now in limited but expanding deployment aboard all ships that are outfitted with the Hwacha or Hwacha Mk 2 missile launchers, but are generally used only in emergencies, or when the ship has depleted its store of Apocalypse torpedoes."

4995, "Ouster"

4996, "The Ouster is a widely produced Gef imitation of the UEF's standard-issue Apocalypse torpedo. Armed with a four-stage fusion warhead instead of an antimatter tip and guided by comparatively primitive systems, the Ouster poses a limited but respectable standoff attack threat."

4997, "AL-SS/SAM"

4998, "A surface-to-surface/surface-to-air missile representative of those deployed by heavy armor."

4999, "
	Aspect-seeking missile
	Velocity 250, Range 1325, ROF 2.0
	DPS 40 Armor, 32 Shield, 28 Subsystem
	BAS 2.5
	"

5000, "GTM-55x Trebuchet"

5001, "Capital ship mounted Trebuchet."

5002, "Eos ISM"

5003, "The Eos Interim Strike Missile is a variant of the warship-launched torpedo adapted for use by bombers, including the GTVA's new OpEval drone platforms. Like its cousin, it is a high-speed, low-yield weapon."

I extend a warm welcome to all new officers, crew and pilots who have recently arrived to the Orestes. I am looking forward to sharing this voyage with all of you. I hope you will find this tour of duty challenging and rewarding.

The Orestes is the newest destroyer to be commissioned by GTVA Command. She is the flagship of the 14th Battlegroup, and has been assigned the honour of leading our first task force through the Sol subspace portal. This mission is the culmination of years of dedication and work by our species. Words cannot adequately convey how proud I am to share in this experience with all of you. The Orestes will be carrying on the legacy of her forebearers, and your service here will only extend the ship's proud history. 

Serve her well, and you will be distinguished.

Admiral Bei,
GTD Orestes"

6280, "MESSAGE 2

Greetings, pilot and welcome to the Orestes. I'm Captain Al'Faddil, your squadron leader. I'll be your liaison to quarterdeck and will be giving you your briefings and debriefings for each of your sorties.

The 222nd Nightwolves has been given the honour of accompanying the 14th Battlegroup into Sol. We have also been given the additional honour of being based aboard the Orestes, so appreciate the luck that brought you here. We at the 222nd have to maintain the superlative record that the squadron has built up over the years. Though the names of the pilots may change, the Nightwolves tradition clearly has not. I expect each one of you to fly to the best of your ability and I will tolerate no insult to the squadron's name.

I will be briefing you on your first mission as soon as the task force enters the Sol system. Until then, take some time to familiarise yourself with the schematics of the Orestes' onboard fighters and bombers. We'll be flying many of these strike craft in times to come. Versatility and adaptability: this is what makes an outfit such as ourselves.

Captain Al'Faddil

For the attention of Commander Samuel Bei,

I don't know what possessed you to transfer to the Orestes, Samuel. You've got some nerve. I still haven't forgiven you for your negligence in the Capellan massacre.

Understand that you'll get no favours from me while you're on board my ship. Also understand that our relationship here will be nothing but professional.

6420, "To the officers and crew of the 14th Battlegroup.

This is Admiral Bei, GTD Orestes. We have begun to finalise preparations to establish our forces in this system. Reconnaisance flights have returned from seeking out sources of Terran activity around Earth and Mars. The data we have gathered is a disturbing contradiction to previous intelligence gathered by surveillance probes sent before us. As yet, we are at a loss as to how to account for the discrepancies we have uncovered.

Earth as we knew her is no more. Her proud cities, forests, countless animal species and ecosystems are gone. Our stations and ships, including the 1st Fleet, are nowhere to be found. Instead, a debris field rings our planet, while nothing but scorch marks are all that is left on the ground. By all appearances, our Earth and her colonies throughout the system have suffered the same fate as Vasuda Prime."

6421, "At present we do not know who was responsible for Earth's fate. Our analysts are going over data collected from our scans of the system, as well as previous data collected from the unmanned probes. 

We have tried to contact GTVA Command regarding our findings but have received no response. We suspect that due to the nature of the subspace portal, even transmissions at maximum strength have difficulty in travelling through. We are deploying the GTC Duke through to Delta Serpentis to re-establish contact with Command. In the meantime, our primary objective is to search the system for any survivors of the attack."

6422, "I am ordering the fleet to maintain a heightened state of alertness until we have confirmed the nature of these findings. The similarity of the attack to the one at Vasuda Prime suggests a Shivan origin. Currently there is no way to tell if Shivan forces are still in the system, or whether they have left through another, uncharted jump node.

Our secondary objective in this system is to identify any alternative entry and departure points from the system. Shivan movements in the First and Second Shivan Incursions suggested that they are as dependent on subspace nodes as we are. If that is the case, there should be another subspace node somewhere in the system.

We shall grieve for our Blue Planet, but in the fullness of time. Our main objective is to secure the sector and ensure the safety of our ships in the days to come.

Admiral Bei
GTD Orestes"

6423, "All right, Nightwolves. It's time for another reconnaisance mission. As you have just heard, Earth is toast and so is every other colonised planet and moon in this system. Until Intelligence is finished analysing that shuttle we picked up we have no idea when this attack occured. Either our probes were picking up false signals, or the attack happened right between the probe deployments and our arrival here."

6424, "Assuming the attack was relatively recent, there's got to be some survivors out there. $f Orestes $f Tactical has identified several areas in the system that could serve as ideal hiding spots for survivors. We've been sent to patrol the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter orbits. The density of the field makes it a hazardous place, but it also scrambles any external sensor sweeps. Very handy for anyone who needs to hide out for a while."

6425, "Commander Bei, you'll be taking $f Alpha wing. Since you seem to be doing just fine with Taylor and Corey, they'll be joining up with you for this mission. Pilot Nehru will be coming with you as well. He has just arrived from the $f Temeraire, and he's been itching to get some action.

I'll be taking Zeta wing into another part of the asteroid field. We'll keep in communication and coordinate our searches together. Keep your eyes peeled and your sensors at maximum. If there's someone in there, we will find them."

6426, "Zeta"

6427, "The Shivan presence in the asteroid was entirely unexpected and has great implications regarding the attack on Earth. We think the fighters you encountered were remnants of the attack force responsible for the Earth devastation. They must have missed their ticket back home. Admiral Bei believes they were put into standby until a destroyer or transport arrived to pick them up. Our incursion into the field must have reactivated them.

Still, your flying out there was excellent, pilots. Outnumbered and outgunned by advanced Shivan fighters, you managed to fight them off and come away alive. Admiral Bei has decreed that all surviving pilots in your wing receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for superlative flying under difficult conditions. Wear it with pride."

6428, "You did not have authorisation to return to base, pilot. You were specifically ordered to stay in the area until reinforcements arrived. There is now a Shivan force somewhere in this system that threatens the safety of each of our ships. Taking them out would have made things a lot easier.

Lieutenant Corey, Ensign Taylor and Lieutenant Nehru perished after your desertion. You are ordered to attend their funerals tomorrow morning, 0700 hours. You will be subject to court-martial shortly after."

Our work here is finished. We came here on an intelligence-gathering mission, but are left with more questions than when we started. We travelled here to make contact with Earth, only to find there is no Earth to make contact with.

All that is left in this system is death and memories of what used to be. The Shivans were responsible for the death of our world, leaving no survivors. They arrived, destroyed our ships, and bombarded Earth, Mars and every colony in the system. The remnants of the Shivan attack force were encountered and destroyed by our reconnaisance flights.

Even after our work here, the hard questions remain. How did the Shivans enter this system? When did the attack occur? Why did our probes send back false information?"

6532, "GTVA Command has not responded to any of our transmissions. Furthermore, we have lost contact with the GTC Duke, who has not returned from Delta Serpentis. I have thus ordered the fleet to move back through the node. All future reconnaissance flights are cancelled, and all fighters are to return to dock.

Now is the time to grieve. It is now time to share news of this tragedy with the rest of the Lost Generation.

Your transfer request to the Orseis has been approved. It will take place upon successful arrival to Delta Serpentis.

I must...admit to some surprise and relief upon your return to the Orestes after the Shivan ambush. I am sure your mother would have been very proud of you. I know we both have had our differences in the past, but your mother would not have wished this rift between us.

We are sending a wing out to apprehend the Duke before she jumps through the node.

Bei, you're the most experienced pilot in this squadron. You will be taking Taylor and Corey as Alpha wing. In case the Duke jumps out before you, you are to follow the Duke through to Ross 128.

The Duke continues to lead us on a wild chase. We followed it from Delta Serpentis to Ross 128, but somehow it outmanoeuvered us and escaped into the Laramis system. From there, it continued to evade us to the N362 jump node. N362! Why the hell does it want to go there?

Our official orders were to consider the behaviour of the commanding officer as criminal, and to apprehend the ship as such. Having chased the Duke through two systems, I'm starting to believe her crew's intentions are rooted more from insanity than mere insubordination. Sensor readings from my fighter wing revealed power fluctuations within the cruiser's systems. If this is the case, then a reactor failure is indeed imminent.

Something is not right about all of this. Why is Delta Serpentis, Ross 128 and Laramis empty of any GTVA vessels, save for Great War hulks? Why haven't we had contact with Command?

The GTC Duke is a haunted ship.

No one was there to greet me at the airlock when I broke through to the Duke's corridors. The entire ship was silent. My skin crawled as soon as I left my environment suit and the hairs stood up at the back of my neck. I felt as though I was being watched as I made my way to the Duke's bridge.

The crew were at their stations, but...they were in some kind of stupor. Every one of them, including Captain Sassana. They didn't respond to my presence. They just...sat there, with their sightless eyes staring. It sent chills down my spine just to look at them. They were alive, but not. As though something had taken away their souls, their essence...their psyche.

And the ship. The ship seems possessed. I heard voices, ghostly footsteps down the hallways. The strange thing was...I recognised some of those voices. I've heard them before...in my dreams. Those voices were manning the ship in place of the crew. Ancient, ancient voices...

Something happened to the Duke and her crew in Delta Serpentis. Something that possessed the ship and drove the crew into catatonia.

There was nothing else I could do. I returned to my fighter, and awaited the arrival of the Temeraire..."

Good work in apprehending the GTC Duke. We're in the process of transferring the crew to the GTL Solace for analysis and treatment. Repair crews are fixing most of the damage in her hull, and her reactor will be repaired within the day. Say what you will about the Vasudans, at least they know how to build their reactors to last.

Don't worry, Commander, your wingmen are safe. We picked them up not too long ago at various points in the system. Apart from some minor damage to their fighter's navigation computers, they were fine.

6653, "Finding Sanctuary"

6654, "Officers, crew and personnel of the GTD Temeraire,

We have established our presence in the N362 system, and surrounding space appears to be clear of hostiles. Our navigation computer has compensated for the gravitational influence from the neutron star. The crew of the GTC Duke has been transferred to the GTL Solace, and a temporary replacement crew for the cruiser has been assigned.

Upon questioning of Captain Iwakura and Commander Tell, we have ascertained that there is a significant discrepancy between GTVA historical records and theirs. Our records show that the Lucifer was successfully destroyed in transit between Delta Serpentis and Sol, resulting in the collapse of the node. According to Iwakura and Tell, the mission to destroy the Lucifer failed, which resulted in the destruction of Earth and the annihilation of every colony in Sol. The GTA was unable to organise another assault against the Lucifer and was subsequently overwhelmed by the Shivan armada."

6655, "Captain Iwakura claimed to be from the Terran sleeper ship Sanctuary. The Sanctuary is a modified Orion-class destroyer that was under construction during the Great War. Upon losing contact with Earth and the 1st Fleet, the GTA began devising an operation to evacuate as many people as possible from contested systems. The Sanctuary was modified to support passengers in hibernation. However, her systems were mostly incomplete, and vulnerable to Shivan attack.

The remnants of GTA forces attempted a final incursion against Shivan forces as the Sanctuary made her way from Delta Serpentis to N362, where interference from the neutron star would conceal her from Shivan scouts. The distraction succeeded, and the Sanctuary was able to pass through undetected. She has remained in the system to this day, waiting for the Shivans to leave. As far as her crew is aware, they are the only Terrans left alive in the entire galaxy."

6656, "With such a discrepancy between our respective historical records, it can only be concluded that we have somehow reached an alternate universe to our own. If this is the case, then we are the first Terrans in history to have achieved interdimensional travel. While speculation on the phenomenon of alternate dimensions exists, actual travel between universes has remained unproven and unrecorded. 

The most likely timepoint of entry into this universe would be during our transit from Delta Serpentis to Sol. Engineering reported fluctuations in the both the Orestes' and the Temeraire's meson reactors when entering the portal, but as power integrity was not affected, it was deemed an isolated anomaly. Further studies will have to be undertaken to determine the nature of these fluctuations and how they relate to our current situation. We are also working on a solution regarding the return to our home universe."

6657, "Contact with the Orestes is intermittent and sparse. Although we have dropped communication buoys throughout Ross 128 and Laramis, the vast distances require significant transit times for our transmissions. We have informed the Orestes of our findings, but it will take some time before we recieve an answer.

In the meantime, we are establishing a ren-dez-vous with the sleeper ship Sanctuary. Captain Iwakura has informed us that the Sanctuary is based in the nebula surrounding the neutron star N362. The volatility of the nebula makes for an ideal hiding environment, but due to extreme gravitational forces, it is a forbidding and perilous place to navigate.

Rear Admiral Carey

6658, "Welcome to quarterdeck, Commander. Although this space is usually reserved for squadron leaders, the importance of this mission necessitates that I brief you directly on your next sortie. Captain Iwakura has specifically requested you to join her into the N362 nebula, so I have assigned you leadership over Alpha wing in this mission."

6659, "N362"

6660, "You and your wing are to follow Captain Iwakura into the nebula as part of an expeditionary force. We cannot risk sending any of our capital ships in due to the intense gravitational forces within the nebula.

Flight deck has prepared a wing of Aurora fighters. The sensor module on the fighter will give you extended sensor capabilities within the nebula, giving you an advantage should there be any hostile contact."

6663, "Choose wingmen that you trust, Commander. Your wing is going to be first contact to the Sanctuary, and I expect each one of you to act appropriately as ambassadors of the GTVA."

6664, "We are honoured by your presence, pilots of the GTVA. Welcome to the Sanctuary, the last refuge for our people, and our final hope for survival. We have already heard from Captain Iwakura about your origins and your ships. While the circumstances of our meeting are certainly strange, it is no less welcome for that.

We will establish communications with your command ship and initiate preparations for evacuating the nebula. It will not be long before the Shivans arrive in greater force, and we need to be away from the system before this happens.

Thanks to your presence, our spark of hope has grown."

6665, "Sit down, pilots.

I don't want any excuses from anyone. What I want to know is why your wing let that sleeper ship die out there. There were tens of thousands of refugees aboard that ship, and the first real clue we had to what's going on.

The Temeraire and her ships are going to rendezvous with the Orestes battlegroup in Delta Serpentis. You'll be confined to your quarters until you are transferred back to your command ship."

I think you can expect to serve more unofficial first-contact sorties in the near future if you keep this up.

Everyone on board is excited to hear about our contact with the Sanctuary. First negotiations are underway, so we should be able to get a better understanding of this universe and how things work here. In the meantime, the admiral's authorised you to either sit in at the negotiations or take a rest, whichever you feel is best. I'm sure we'll hear about the results soon enough anyway."

6733, "Doesn't the word 'tradition' mean anything to you, Taylor? This is the standard GTVA procedure for initiating diplomatic contact with a new faction. We've always been doing this."

6734, "Standard GTVA procedure? There is no GTVA! The GTVA is all the way in some parallel universe that we can't get to."

6735, "The GTVA is here too, Taylor. The GTVA exists whereever there is a ship that acts in the service of the alliance. The GTVA existed in the nebula beyond Gamma Draconis. The GTVA existed in the space beyond the second Knossos."

6737, "Sir...do you really believe that? Lost in some alternate universe, far away from home and family...Ceremonies like this are still important?"

6738, "I do, Taylor. And I believe that all the ideals we were taught while serving the GTVA are going to get us through all this."

6739, "You should feel honoured, pilots of the GTVA. Who else would be given an invitation to fly honour guard for an admiral from another universe?"

6740, "Now that, alone, would make this a special occasion."

6741, "The invitation was the very least the admiral could do. After all, you defended the Sanctuary from a Shivan attack with bravery and skill. I'm surprised she didn't award you an Order of Galatea."

6742, "You see, Taylor? This universe isn't so different after all. We share some similarities in the way Command awards its pilots."

6764, "We have made first contact with the Sanctuary, and have begun her integration into our battlegroup. She has undergone minor repairs with the assistance of the logistics ship Solace, but for the most part has successfully maintained hull and systems integrity. Inspection by the Solace's engineers has revealed the Sanctuary to be fully self-reliant and self-sufficient. Modified dust intakes collect nebula gas and there's a full fuel processing facility on board the ship. Moreover, the Sanctuary holds tens of thousands of Great War refugees in cryogenic suspension, waiting for the day that humankind could claim another planet as home."

6765, "Upon hearing of our origins, Admiral Nechyev has made her intentions clear regarding the future of the ship and her passengers. The admiral and her crew wish to follow us back to our home universe, where humanity has not been destroyed by the Shivans and where mankind still has a home among the stars.

Although we have at present no means or understanding on how to return to our universe, I have accepted the request of the Sanctuary's crew to accompany us. From a humanitarian perspective, we cannot condemn these refugees to a life in hiding, waiting for the Shivans to determine their fate. Nor can we deny ourselves the company of what is likely to be the only remaining human presence in these systems."

6766, "The destruction of the SD Kyton appears to have captured the attention of Shivan forces in Laramis. Shivan activity has intensified within N362, and reconnaisance reports a large number of Shivan warships entering the system from the Laramis jump node. A number of shivan warships are based at the node, preventing any ship from leaving the system.

This presents us with a tactical difficulty. The blockade is of sufficient strength to challenge our warships, and without the help of the Orestes battlegroup, we cannot guarantee the survival of our ships if we attempt to break through. Communication difficulties prevent us from coordinating an assault with the Orestes. There is also no way to tell if a similar blockade is being set up on the far side of the node in the Laramis system. This has significantly limited our strategic options, and time is growing short."

6767, "Fortunately, there exists an alternative exit strategy. Navigation logs were downloaded from the Duke's computer to ascertain the final destination of the possessed cruiser. Reconnaisance at those coordinates revealed a striking find: a Knossos artifact. This is the only knowledge that we have had of a Knossos portal in this system, although it has been theorised that several unstable subspace nodes must exist, due to the intense gravitational forces exerted by the N362 star. The portal appears to have been only recently activated, most likely by a communication from the Duke once it had arrived in the system. The activation of the portal might also account for the increased Shivan activity. Though we have no idea where the portal leads, it presents a more attractive target than running blockades in Shivan-contested systems.

I have ordered our ships to make for the portal. To maximise our chances of success, the Temeraire will be making a diversionary attack at the Laramis node, in an effort to draw Shivan forces away from the rest of the battlegroup. Although the Temeraire was designed for rear-line operations, she is still a formidable offensive platform, and the most powerful warship we have available. Our onboard mounted torpedo launchers should also give us a tactical advantage over Shivan capital ships, so long as we outrange their main beam cannons."

6768, "We have yet to regain contact with the GTD Orestes. We have no idea as to the status of the destroyer, and can only assume that we make this journey alone. 

Should our fortunes turn against us today, keep with you this affirmation: I have been honoured to serve with you all, and I have no doubt in my mind that the Temeraire is home to the finest crew in the GTVA. Godspeed.

Rear Admiral Carey,
GTD Temeraire"

6769, "All right 56th. We've got our backs up against the wall, with nowhere to run. We've been cut off from the $f Orestes $f battlegroup, and have been forced into making a run for the Knossos portal. The Shivans are moving into this system like flies onto a corpse, so there's precious little time to prepare."

6770, "Unknown Portal"

6771, "Rear Admiral Carey has ordered the battlegroup to split into two groups. The first group, composed of the $f Sanctuary, the $f Solace, $f Labouchere, $f Duke and $f Bretonia will make a run for the node. You've been assigned to cover their retreat alongside elements from 61st Squadron. The $f Temeraire and her fighter wings are to form the second group. They will be assaulting Shivan positions at the Laramis jump node in an attempt to draw as many Shivan forces away from the Knossos portal as possible. Be thankful you don't have to be in that firestorm, pilots."

6772, "Group A"

6773, "Scouting wings report a number of Shivan vessels near the portal. Two $r Rakshasa class cruisers are in the area, with two wings of $r Mara fighters as escorts. The Maras will be your primary targets, but do not spend too long taking them out. Our ships will be entering the system soon after you arrive, and will be making their way to the portal. We need the anti-ship firepower of the Shivan cruisers minimised if our ships are going to survive the gauntlet. Of course, don't expect the rest of the Shivans in this system to sit idly by while we steal the last vestiges of humanity from under their noses, so expect further Shivan forces to arrive."

6774, "You'll be operating without logistical support, pilots. The majority of the Temeraire's resources have been spent preparing for the assault at the Laramis node. Try to save your secondary armament, since you'll have nothing to replace it with over the course of this mission. For this reason also, choose your armament selection carefully.

You may consider arming yourselves with Trebuchet missiles and Maxim cannon in order to disarm warship beams at long range."

6775, "The Myrmidon's fighter-bomber refit makes it compatible with Cyclops torpedoes."

6776, "We've lost the GTC Duke to Shivan fire. The tragedy of this loss cannot be overstated."

6777, "Disarm or destroy the Rakshasa cruisers as quickly as possible, and make sure to engage Lakshmi wing to draw them away from the cruiser.

If you can't kill the cruisers fast enough, try this:

Arm your wingmen with Maxim cannons and Trebuchet missiles. Order them to ignore the cruisers at mission start, except Delta Wing, which should attack one cruiser. Have your wingmen 'engage enemy'. When the Maras are destroyed, have all wingmen attack one cruiser, then the other.

You should be able to kill them both in under two minutes."

6778, "We've lost the GTCv Labouchere to Shivan fire. The tragedy of this loss cannot be overstated."

6779, "The Taurvi bombers are the greatest threat to the Labouchere. Make sure she has a fighter screen while she is in the field."

6780, "We've lost the GTC Bretonia to Shivan fire. The tragedy of this loss cannot be overstated."

6781, "Lakshmi wing is the greatest threat to the Bretonia, but make sure she remains protected after the Aeshmas are destroyed."

6782, "During her run to the portal, the Sanctuary was lost with all hands. Every last Terran born in this universe is now extinct. It will not be long before we are, too."

6783, "Disable the main beam of the Naberus as quickly as possible. Do this yourself if you have to, as it's imperative that the Sanctuary has fighter cover against Shivan bombers."

6784, "The logistics ship Solace was lost to Shivan fire. Without supplies, repairs and ammunition, our time surely grows short."

6785, "Ensure the Solace has fighter cover. Shivan bombers are her greatest threat."

6786, "We lost the GTD Temeraire, home to ten thousand crew and our last chance for salvation from the Shivans."

6787, "Protect the Temeraire with everything you've got when she arrives. Shivan bombers are a threat, but the Abel takes precedence. Destroy the main heavy beams of the Abel, as well as the lighter beams on the dorsal side."

6788, "Personal Log, Commander Bei.

Well, we did it. We got everyone through safely. The Temeraire, her ships, and the Sanctuary are now in the hands of fate and fortune. No one knows what's on the other side of the Knossos portal. All that we know is that it's connected to those beings who possessed the Duke and brought her here. And it was here where we found the Sanctuary. 

Coincidence? Maybe not. Whoever designed this to happen can't be all that bad if they gave us the opportunity to save these refugees from the Shivans.

I wonder what has happened to the Orestes and the rest of the battlegroup. I hope they're ok, wherever they are. And I hope we'll be able to join up with them again before this is all over..."

To the officers and crew of the GTD Temeraire, and her accompanying ships.

We've made the trip through hell and come out of the other side. We withstood everything the Shivans threw at us to come to this place. We are now in uncharted territory, and have gone where no Terran or Vasudan has ever been in recorded history.

Since we have arrived here, no Shivan vessel has followed us through the Knossos portal. We do not yet know the reason for this, but have welcomed the respite. We've taken the opportunity to undergo minor repairs and send out reconnaissance flights to probe the immediate area. I'm keeping the battlegroup on heightened alertness, as action may come upon us at any time. Stay vigilant, and be ready to be on call should the time come.

We cheated death again. The Temeraire and her ships are safe. The Shivan madness seems to have burned itself out. There's been nothing official yet, but I'm pretty sure that there are no Shivans left in the system anymore.

Those Vishnans. That's what they call themselves, at least in our speech. They have been the piece of the puzzle which has been missing from this whole thing, ever since the Duke went crazy and brought us here. As soon as the Duke was touched by the psychic emissions of the Vishnans, the Shivans knew we were here. Since then, they've been doing their best to wipe us from existence.

As the Shivans were the Great Destroyers, so the Vishnans are the Great Preservers. Where there is imbalance, they seek to restore balance, restore the natural order of the universe.

Now the Vishnans know we're here. Because we're here, they're not going to let anything get in the way of putting things right.

How do I know all this? I ask myself the same question. It's as though I've been listening to whispers all through my life, and that now I'm at this particular moment in time, everything I've heard has come together to fit in a harmony and unity that I never before thought possible. It's as though my entire life has been building up towards this sequence of events. I'm the only one they talk to. I've been trying to get them to communicate with the others, but thus far with no success.

That feeling again. As though I were a nexus, a fulcrum for the universe. When I move, the universe moves with me. I felt it in the Second Great War, but it's nothing compared to how I feel now.

The Admiral doesn't believe me when I told her that the Orestes was in danger. She wants to bring the fleet back up to full strength before organising an expedition to head back to Delta Serpentis. I'm reluctant to inform her about my current relationship with the Vishnans. How they communicate with me, and no one else. I think I'd be more likely referred to Medlab than to be taken seriously.

The Admiral is a good person, and a fine commanding officer. This is why I undertake this next action with only the utmost reluctance."

Well, I did it. I set things in motion that can't be reversed. I went against my superior officer, deserted and put into question everything I learned about loyalty and obedience so that I could fulfill something which has not been anything more than a nagging feeling all of my life. Everything seems to have worked out so far. My guilt at leaving Corey and Taylor behind is still present, but I've consoled myself with the thought that I won't be dragging them into something which must be done alone.

What I've experienced, I can hardly describe. For the sake of future correspondence, I will attempt to do so now."

7041, "My body is still intact, along with my physical effects. These Vishnans, however, don't exist in the same way we do. Their ships aren't crewed by personnel. If it didn't sound so strange, I'd say these ships of theirs are the Vishnans themselves.

They are psychic beings, as pure in existence as anything we've come across. To call them energy beings would be to miss the point. They inhabit this universe in much the same way that we would inhabit a room. They exist in some other plane far removed from our material existence. Their ships are vessels to carry their will, nothing more. 

When I came aboard, the Vishnans put my body into suspension. I will need little in the way of nourishment or sustenance. My psyche has been transplanted into a ship of my own. I don't experience reality as they do, but in essence, I now have a ship to carry out my will."

7042, "Before this the Vishnans have had no knowledge of my father...it is strange. It's almost as though my memories have unlocked specific aspects of the universe which had escaped their notice previously. They now know about the GTVA. They know how we entered this universe. Because of this, they have a connection with everyone I have ever known and met. 

They don't see abstracts of time and space anymore...in a way, I think I have shown them what it means to live as a material being."

7043, "Samuel Bei Cheow Keng. The $g Sacred $g Keeper and her ships are yours for you to guide as you will. By accessing your thought-memories we are now aware of the position of your ships. We will move to release them from the bonds that now surround them."

7046, "You will lead our missionaries through the portal and provide the foundation by which the rest of our ships may travel through. If there are Shivan fightercraft, you will destroy them.

7047, "We owe much of our safe transit to your skill, Samuel Bei. Though the Shivans were not of sufficient numbers to threaten the Keeper, our Arbiters were under a significant enough threat to make their survival uncertain.

We have entered the Laramis system and have detected Shivan forces moving to the Ross 128 jump node. Though they would rather flee than engage our ships, it is likely they are concentrating their limited strength into Ross 128.

For now, we go unchallenged."

7180, "Demons of the Past"

7181, "In the Piscean Age, it was common belief among Christ-inspired doctrines that when one died, that person's soul essence would leave the material plane. If the person had been virtuous in life, then the soul would ascend to heaven. If the person had been sinful, then hell would await them.

Dissatisfaction with black and white concepts of sinfulness and sainthood, and the difficulty in determining where the line was drawn provoked alternative suggestions of where the consciousness departs once a person's life was over. Some have reverted to ancient Geminian religion, while others look toward eastern philosophy for alternatives."

7182, "Based on testimony of those who had experienced near-death experiences, it was hypothesised that the consciousness enters first a plane of positive energy, where the good achievements of the life past were reflected upon and lessons taken away from these events. 

After, the soul enters a dark plane of negative energy, where disappointments and frustrations were worked through, and lessons learned from these were also taken away. Having grown thus, the soul remerges with the universe, where it may be reincarnated into another life to continue the lessons it had learned in previous lives."

7183, "It was believed that one only died because that person had learned everything they needed to learn from this life. One's death always has meaning, even if it is not apparent to those who that person leaves behind. Therefore, one should not always grieve for one's lost potential, but instead gain solace from the fruitfulness of that person's life, and to reflect upon the events which had helped shape that person. Know that the person's death is not meaningless, no matter how cruel it may seem. With the gift of perspective comes solace and soothing."

7184, "Those persons who contained old souls had moved towards a balance between positive and negative karma. The oldest and wisest of these souls would eventually ascend to a state resembling divinity: they were one with the universe while at the same able to guide and teach others on the Material plane. They are known as Ascended Masters.

To see your place in the universe, to know that you yourself are not just a mote amongst many, but a union of brothers and sisters working together for common good, that is when you have ascended. You are enlightened. Though these Ascended Masters are few, given enough time their numbers will grow until we as an entire race have risen to enlightenment."

7185, "After 5000 years of recorded wars, atrocities and injustice, I believe it is soon time for our racial consciousness to rise above our petty differences, and in the spirit of Ubuntu, realise that what makes us human binds us together. 

After the Age of Spirituality came the Age of Reason. After realising that Reason nor Spirituality alone cannot guide us, we will combine Reason and Spirituality into a new way of thinking. We will exist in rational faith, and in faithful rationality in a new Age of Enlightenment.

The corpse-choked corridors of Bosch's Iceni. The half-century-old screams of a doomed pilot who could FEEL the Shivans chasing him.
 
We called it Nagari. A nonlocal quantum process that could induce neural activity via subspace. A wonder - and a terror.
 
Could the enemy weaponize cognition? Could the Hammer of Light's religious awe be the result of external stimulation of the temporal lobe? Might our oldest mental structures - superstition, spirituality, fear, even love - become fatal vulnerabilities - breaches in our heuristic armor?"

7187, "Some saw Nagari as a pathway to singularity - a computational engine as powerful as the logic of the universe itself. Could the process be the key to utopia? Could a society of compassionate pluralism emerge from the whispers of a transcendent alien mind? Could there even be truth to ancient philosophies of spiritual ascension?
 
But we saw apocalypse. Humanity chained to an ancient, unfathomable mechanism. And we knew there was only one choice."

7239, "Welcome back to the Orestes, Commander Bei.

You're lucky to be alive. We found your environment suit floating near the Ross 128 jump node. You were only minimally alive, and running out of air. We don't know how you ended up there, but you're safe now. I'm expecting a report from the ship's medical staff, but it looks like you'll be able to return to duty soon.

I'm sending you this transmission for now instead of debriefing you. That will come in its own time. For now, understand that I have never seen the Admiral in such a mood since I joined up with this ship. You should know he's been very relieved to have you back, Commander.

Please send me a communique when you're back on your feet. For now, get as much rest as you can. We're not out of danger yet.

Captain Esmar Al'Fadil
222nd Nightwolves Squadron"

7240, "Welcome back, Commander. Good to see you back on your feet again. Everyone's already suited up and launched, but I figured you needed the extra time to get briefed on what's been happening since you've been gone. As you know, we attempted to gather our battlegroup together after the $g Temeraire was sent after you to support your wing in Ross 128. The $g Orestes does not have the mobility of the Titan class destroyer, so it took us somewhat longer to recharge our engines and gather our forces."

7241, "A $r Shivan ambush in Ross 128 forced us to halt our progress, and we were split off from the $g Temeraire. We had no choice but to retreat back to Delta Serpentis. Unfortunately, soon after we arrived in the system, we encountered a $r Lucifer superdestroyer. While our weaponry was strong enough to pierce the $r Lucifer's shields, we were barely holding our own. We were very lucky your ships arrived when they did, as we were unsure how long we would have been able to hold out."

7242, "As soon as the $r Sathanas jumped in and destroyed the alien capital ship, all remaining alien ships, including your own, ceased functioning. We were forced to jump out in retreat, and as such we are unsure of their fate. We can only conclude that they were eliminated once they posed no challenge to the $r Sathanas."

7243, "At the moment we are currently in the Ross 128 system being pursued by the $r Sathanas juggernaut. Admiral Bei has split up the battlegroup in order to maximise the survivability of our ships. The plan appears to have worked: the $r Sathanas' strike craft complement has been greatly reduced in attacks against the $g GTL $g Fortune, $g GTCv $g Boreas and escorting ships. So far we appear to be the intended target of the $r Sathanas, as the juggernaut has not attempted to engage the rest of the battlegroup directly."

7244, "We have deployed hit and run attacks against the $r Sathanas in order to weaken its offensive ability, but these have been met with only limited success. Our engines will require a recharge, during which time we will be vulnerable. We need you to cover the $g Orestes during this time. The $r Sathanas will still have its forward beams functional, so your highest priority will be in taking out its main beam cannons. This is risky procedure that has only been attempted once in history, but it is the only option we have remaining."

7245, "When this is all over, Commander, I'm going to personally recommend you for a promotion, given everything that you've done for us today. "

7246, "Personal Log, Commander Bei.

Final Entry.

That's it then. Our journey is over. Like hundreds of thousands of our fellow Terrans, our end was met at the hands of Shivans. Oh, my end has not yet arrived. But I will be dead soon. As I write this, Shivan fighters are closing in on me. I can take solace in the fact that soon I go to join Eriana in whatever lies beyond this life."

7247, "For your excellent service record and your notable achievements throughout your tour of duty aboard the Orestes, it is my great honour and pleasure to promote you to the rank of Captain. As you now hold leadership rank, you will be offered command over a GTVA vessel or fighter squadron once we return to GTVA space. Congratulations, Captain Bei.

We have gathered our ships, and have made contact with the Temeraire and our newest addition to the fleet, the Sanctuary. Rear Admiral Carey has briefed us on our situation, and while the news is astounding, it goes a long way in explaining our anomalous findings in these systems. We have collated information regarding the Vishnan race, and require you to give a report at 1900 hours later tonight. Admirals Carey and Nechyev will be in attendance.

We will spend the next few days attempting to recreate the energy surge experienced by our meson reactors during transit through the Sol node. This will enable us to find a way back home by recreating the effect. With the Shivan threat eliminated, this has become our highest priority.

Once again, Captain, congratulations. I am proud to call you my protege, my heir, and my son."

We have managed to repair most of the damage sustained by the Shivan attacks. My thanks go to the engineers of the GTL Solace and Fortune for their efficient work in bringing our ships back up to combat capability. However, supplies on both ships are running low, and we need to find a solution to our isolation soon or risk running dry.

To that end, we are moving back to the Delta Serpentis system, where we plan to run tests on our power reactors whilst in transit between the Delta Serpentis and Sol systems. By replicating the process which brought us here, we will be able to return to our home universe.

7311, "***PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL***

For the attention of Captain Samuel Bei,

After meeting with Rear Admiral Carey regarding your conduct aboard the Temeraire, it is my decision not to submit you for court martial for desertion and for disobeying a superior officer, due to mitigating circumstances. There is no way to tell how much influence Vishnan psychic communication had over your judgement. Testimony from Lieutenant Commander Corey and Lieutenant J. G. Taylor provides supporting evidence that you were not of sound judgement.

This is the official reason. Unofficially, it is my opinion that it required courage and skill to lead a Vishnan assault force to Delta Serpentis. Without your intervention, destruction of the Orestes and her ships would surely have been likely. There is also one more reason why I have chosen not to put you under court martial."

7312, "Sam, I thought I'd let you know. While myself, Rear Admiral Carey and Admiral Nechyev approached your testimony on the nature of the Vishnan psychic communications with skepticism, I have rethought my position on your report after shared experiences over the past few days. Though I am keeping the reason for my change in position unofficial, it is no less relevant to our situation at hand.

I have been in communication with representatives of the Vishnan race, in a manner which I find entirely unusual. Visions and dreams, just like those which you have described..."

7313, "For the attention of Captain Samuel Bei,

Greetings Captain. This is Captain Kristae from the Temeraire. Rear Admiral Carey has briefed me on your activities during your first contact with the Vishnans and has authorised me to give you the following information.

Engineering has completed a scan of your flight logs during your first contact mission. They did not find any evidence of an energy drain such as that which you described. Moreso, your records did not log the presence of communications jamming, which you experienced upon jumping into the area.

We will provide you with more information when it becomes available.

7500, "Personal Log, Captain Samuel Bei, formerly of the GTVA 14th Battlegroup.

It has begun. On 4th April, 2285, the United Earth Federation and member nations declared war on the GTVA in retaliation for the destruction of the Renjian three days prior. Within 12 hours, half of all personnel in the Sol Expeditionary Force had either resigned from service, or actively defected to Earth. The GTVA advance was forced into retreat back into Delta Serpentis, the ships of the battlegroup already crippled by a lack of supplies and combat personnel.

Earth welcomed us with open arms, knowing that she'll need all the help she can get against the superior military might of the GTVA. The crew and passengers of the Sanctuary now have a new home, and with it, hope of a new future.

As do I. Earth is my home now. Humankind left our blue planet all those years ago in search of utopia among the stars. Had their gaze been directed inwards, rather than out, they would have seen the potential this blue planet holds, as well as the potential inside themselves. Years of isolation and forced introspection have changed the Earthborn. Whereas before their ancestors could claim to be human in name, only now are they worthy to claim the title. For it is only now that they have embraced their humanity: that which makes us human, binds us together.

But the time for work will come later. Now is the time for healing, rest and solace. I'm meeting up with a crewman from the Sanctuary whom I was fortunate enough to meet a couple of days ago. We grew close almost immediately, and I have offered to take her sight-seeing with me around Guangzhou.

Her name is Eriana..."

7542, "Admiral Bei has warped out!"

7543, "All ships. Admiral Bei and the Sanctuary are to be considered traitors to the GTVA, by order of Command, and are to be eliminated on sight. Any other ship who chooses to desert will undergo the same designation."

7544, "We were supposed to return to Earth with open arms and friendship. This was supposed to be a celebration, not a start of a new war!"

7545, "High Command has betrayed the principles on which the GTVA were formed. All our ideologies, discipline, moral guidance mean nothing now!"

7546, "What are we going to do, sir?"

7547, "I tell you what I'm not going to do, Corey. I'm not going to stand idle while the future of our race is thrown into the dust heap to satisfy the military aspirations of those few high up."

7548, "You're free to do what you want to do, Corey and Taylor. You're under no obligation to follow me in what I choose to do. Me, I choose the future of our race, and the pursuit of peace."

7549, "We like this situation no better than you do, Captain. We'll never leave your back. You can count on us, sir."

This is Admiral Byrne. Give me your ears.

I will be plain with you. The rumors you have heard are correct. 

After an eighteen-month stand, Jupiter has fallen to the $r GTVA. The Jovian Systems Republic issued an unconditional surrender at 2330. Admiral Calder's $f Third $f Fleet has been routed.

Alliance marines are now landing on Ganymede. The Jovian government, under threat of orbital bombardment, has agreed to cooperate."

7679, "The details of the Fall of Jupiter are now available for your inspection on FleetNet.

For now, know this. The GTVA has committed to total war.

At 0330 yesterday the front-line destroyers $r Atreus and $r Imperieuse, under $r Admiral $r Chiwetel $r Steele, transited the Delta Serpentis node. These ships and their battle groups carried out the attack on Jupiter at 0700. Steele himself personally captured $f Artemis $f Station, before scorched-earth protocols could be enacted.

By capturing Jupiter's gate network and civilian infrastructure intact, Steele has accomplished what $r Admiral $r Cyrus $r Severanti could not: he has given the GTVA the logistical footing for full-scale war."

7680, "I ask all of you to trust in the strategy set out by the Council of Elders. We will maintain our defensive posture until a diplomatic solution to the war can be achieved.

We have a more immediate task, however. $f Third $f Fleet's survivors need our help. At 2335, Fleet Admiral Calder issued the order for a full-scale retreat to Mars. Warships and strike craft from the $r Imperieuse and $r Atreus battle groups are pursuing these survivors, as well as any civilian convoys that have refused the no-fly order.

As $f Second $f Fleet $f Mars fends off raids from the $r Hood, $r Carthage, and $r Meridian, I will deploy our squadrons to cover the retreat of civilians and $f Third $f Fleet from Jupiter space.

Flight operations commence immediately."

7681, "Remember this. The GTVA wants our worlds and our infrastructure intact. They hope to break our fighting spirit, or to draw us into a foolish offensive.

We will remain implacable and unmoved, and so stymie them. Ubuntu gives us that strength.

7682, "$b FLEETNET $b COMMUNIQUE
$b SENDER: $b Flight $b Lieutenant $b Manuel $b Brie

Noemi, it's Brie.

You know what's happening out there. You've been trained, you've flown patrols. You're ready.

I want you to trust yourself. Yes, your psych profile makes you look like a lamb, and Kassim has his discipline issues, but the two of you have aptitude scores better than most of First Fleet. There's a reason I asked for you two in my wing.

You can fly like no one I've seen. Our Uhlans can match any fighter the Tevs have. The two of you will survive. And I've got a few tricks up my sleeve myself.

Captain Telfer is about to pass on our frag orders. Get to the ready room. If you need to throw up, do it before we launch."

7683, "Eyes up, pilots. If you're a newcomer or a reservist, welcome aboard. I'm Captain Telfer, squadron leader of the 170th Fighting Navajas. 

I've been authorized to confirm that the Jovian capital at Ganymede has fallen. The Tevs have $g Artemis $g Station, the scorched earth program failed, and the gate system and the Jovian comm net are under their control.

Admiral Byrne has ordered the $g Solaris to deploy its squadrons to cover the Jovian retreat. Deck crews are running final prep on our Uhlans right now. We'll be airborne in twenty minutes."

7684, "Scattered tactical reports are still coming in from Jupiter. Admiral Calder's flagship $g Toutatis escaped $r Ganymede and is rallying all surviving Jovian fleet assets for a retreat to Mars. Hundreds of civilian ships are also fleeing the Tev advance. 

Admiral Byrne has agreed to deploy $g Solaris fighter wings to cover this exodus, but major First and Second Fleet assets will remain at Earth and Mars. 

These are our fragment orders. Gamma wing will escort the battered $f UEFg $f Rhineland. Cosoleto, your Beta wing is on standby. Brie, your Alpha wing will deploy to the asteroid belt to cover a civilian convoy that didn't make Calder's rendezvous."

7685, "GTVA Advance"

7686, "Jovian Fleet Headquarters"

7687, "This convoy of civilian sublight transports escaped the fall of Artemis Station. The cruisers $g Ironhide and $g Suffron are providing escort. Alpha, you will provide area defense against Tev strike wings. Hostile skirmishers have already engaged the convoy, and more firepower is likely on the way.

The civilian ships have no jump drives, so they're fleeing Jupiter space via the intrasystem gate network. Last transmission puts them between $g Belt $g Gate $g 42 and $g Mars-Belt $g Gate $g 3, on the inner curve of the asteroid belt."

7688, "Ironhide"

7689, "Many of you have never seen combat. This is not practice and you are not shooting at objects. You will be tangling with ruthless, intelligent enemy pilots. The civilians in your care are husbands, wives, and children. Every ship you lose to the Tevs means more people who will never see their loved ones again.

This is a terrifying responsibility, but an honour afforded to few. Are you clear on this? Good. Bring those people home."

7691, "One minute, Noemi. Walk with me.

Before he died, your father asked me to give you his namkha to carry on your first proper sortie. He was never a spiritual person, unlike your mother, and my sister and your father came to odds enough times over it. But he believed in this article, and that was enough for him. 

No more standing on the sidelines, Noemi. You're about to be thrown into the thick of this war. I hope you're ready for it."

7692, "Welcome back, Alpha wing. You brought both your rooks home, Brie. Good work.

Latest reports from Mars indicate that the Ironhide, Suffron and the rest of the convoy arrived safe and intact. Reports show significant losses of Jovian forces during the retreat and word's going round that Admiral Calder is furious with Admiral Byrne for not providing reinforcements during the GTVA attack.

All outbound communications from Jupiter have ceased following the Tev occupation of Ganymede, and we've lost control of the regional intrasystem gate network. All scheduled civilian traffic to the area has been cancelled. All in all, it looks like we've lost the entire Jovian system to the GTVA.

Besides that, you all did well out there, pilots. Though things are looking grim for us, we all need to do our own little bit to help.

Take five to get some water and stims if you need 'em. There's a combat psych waiting to triage you. When you're done, get back to your birds. The remnants of the Jovian Rim Fleet are still trickling in, and we need to give them cover.

Expect another sortie inside the hour. We'll remember Gamma's pilots when we get the chance."

It felt...good. Like I'd been doing it my whole life. Like I'd found the place I'm meant to be. The fact that that realization came at the moment when I first took a life is slightly horrifying.

7779, "This is the Leeuwenhoek. Our power grid can't cope with the strain! We're losing patients, damn it!"

7780, "Navaja Alpha wing, be advised, the Rhineland came under GTVA attack before she could make it to Mars. We lost all contact with the frigate and Gamma wing."

7781, "Recon has vectored the strike force's approach to your area. Stay alert."

7782, "Copy that, Solaris control. Okay, Alpha wing. Looks like we're about to hit some heavy turbulence. If the Tevs can take out a frigate, they'll roll all over this convoy. Prepare to move as soon as they arrive."

7783, "Roger that, Brie. I hope you saved some Hellfires, Laporte, because I suspect we're gonna need 'em."

7784, "Incoming jump signature, here they come! Two wings of bombers, with two escorting fighter wings. Kassim, Laporte: hold for now. Wait for my call."

7785, "Helm, take us away from the convoy and move towards the fighters. I want us in the middle of their formations, try to scatter them with our bulk. Alpha, follow us out."

7786, "We're right behind you, Ironhide. Point defence weapons, pick your targets and set turrets to fire at will. Prioritise incoming torpedoes."

7791, "Take that, you Tev bastards! Try to attack civilians, will you?"

7792, "Alpha wing, our job is done here. We're warming up our jump drives and plotting a course for Mars."

7793, "Alpha wing, let's move out. Return to base."

7794, "I don't believe it. All of the civilians are dead. You left our people to die!"

7795, "There's no reason for us to stay. We're charging our jump drives and heading to Mars. Get out of our sight, Alpha wing."

7796, "Ironhide, do you read! Captain Chavez! Damn it!"

7797, "Tev fire is incessant! We're getting fractures opening up all along the hull!"

7798, "We're a little busy here Command, but we'll do what we can. Alpha wing, head on a swivel! We're about to hit some heavy turbulence!"

7799, "Federation ships. By traveling with armed escort, you have forfeited your protections under the Beta Aquilae Convention and will be presumed military targets. Cut your engines, or we will fire on you."

7800, "Close in on the bombers and use your Hellfires!"

7801, "Good work, Alpha. The civilians are all through the gate. Set a course for Mars, jump as soon as you're ready."

7802, "Kassim, Laporte. If that Tev strike force gets within firing range to the convoy, they're as good as dead."

7803, "I don't think they're trying to kill civilians...they're just after our shipping. Cripple our freight, our fuel transport, our medical ability. The rest is collateral -"

7804, "Laporte, that's very understanding, very Ubuntu, but really? I think my approach is more useful."

7805, "Sorry, mate...better you than me."

7806, "Huh...this isn't so hard."

7807, "I'm almost enjoying myself..."

7808, "They'll know better than to send more fighters our way. Look what happened last time!"

7809, "Or the next wave could be packing Trebuchets, and we won't have any way to respond. Don't get cocky, Two. I want you home alive."

7810, "We've been through counter-Treb ACM, One. I'm not afraid."

As for the $f Navajas, Cosoleto and $f Beta wing are launching as we speak to cover evac operations at the Jovian storm platforms.

Alpha, you'll be deployed to investigate a possible misjump site for two MIA warships, the frigate $f Akula and heavy frigate $f Ranvir. These are strategically critical assets. We need our artillery intact to deter a massive $r GTVA attack on Earth."

It's possible they're running under EMCON while they compute new jump coordinates, or that they were disabled by the crash jump.

I understand your mission was unsuccessful. I've reviewed your wing leader's flight records - thank you for the precis, Brie - and it is my conclusion that there was nothing you could have done to save the Ranvir and Akula. 

You faced a highly coordinated Tev attack that played to all their strengths. It would have taken a major force commitment to save those frigates, and, regrettably, those forces were unavailable. 

We will remember the eight thousand crew of the Ranvir and the Akula at tonight's Ceremony of the Fallen. 

The Jovian retreat is winding down, and the last stragglers of Third Fleet are either safe in Martian space or already dead. Given that flight operations are slowing down, I want each of you to see a combat psych before your next sortie. 

I need my Alpha wing in good shape. Don't start second-guessing yourselves - you did everything right today. I'll certainly be relying on all of you to continue your good flying over the next few days. This war has finally come home, and we need to prepare for it however we can."

Serkr is a specially fitted combat team using sprint jump drives, sophisticated active armor, and modified weapons. They report directly to Admiral Steele, the man who took Jupiter. I'm sure the Admiralty will explore options on how to pin them down and nullify that threat, but at the moment, it's not our concern."

The Tevs have been deploying a hunter-killer corvette team called Serkr - advanced warships with sprint drives, heavy beams, modified weapons and active armor. Be glad you didn't see them today.

7924, "Acknowledged. All hands, brace for SSM impact."

7925, "Excellent shooting, Ranvir. It's good to see all that gunnery drill at INDRA II paid off. We're hurting but still intact."

7926, "We repelled an attack by four Alliance warships and a light assault force. The Akula is intact, but we are damaged and operating at reduced effectiveness."

7927, "You're still a priority target for the GTVA, Ranvir. Plot an exit solution and jump clear as soon as possible."

7928, "Hey, I've got a new contact. Tev AWACS at forty-five klicks. It's not jamming...that's odd."

7929, "Ignore it. Stay with the Ranvir. It's got to be plotting precision jumps for the Tevs, so expect company any moment."

7930, "Bandits inbound. It's a Trebuchet strike. They'll jump away after launch, so just stay calm and evade the missiles."

7931, "Roger, One, pop-up missile threat acknowledged. Ready to break."

7932, "Still with us, Alpha wing? We'll be jump-ready in less than two minutes, but that AWACS is still out there. It could vector in bombers or a warship."

7933, "We've got you, Ranvir. If they bring in bombers, I'll call for an interceptor wing from the Solaris."

7934, "Stand by. We're reading an Ares wing inbound. Picking up some targeting chatter...we need some intercept cover pronto!"

7935, "It's another subspace missile strike! Alpha, hit your burners and intercept!"

7936, "What if they're trying to draw us away from the Ranvir, One?"

7937, "Follow your orders, Laporte!"

7938, "Acknowledged, Second Fleet. Ranvir clear. Helm, take us to the exit point, ahead full."

7939, "Multiple catastrophic hull failures! Reactor quench unsuccessful! Ranvir, we're going down!"

7940, "The Akula's gone...detecting no survivors."

7941, "That shouldn't have happened! Where the hell is our backup, One? Where are the reserves?"

7942, "Saving a few thousand people somewhere else, Kassim! Now focus - they could come back for the Ranvir!"

7943, "Ranvir, our listening posts have vectored a large subspace transit to your area. We are scrambling a heavy assault squadron to assist you."

7944, "It's Serkr Team. Steele's war dogs, the ones who took Artemis. Alpha wing, clear our blast zone. You've done all you can."

7945, "They just hulled the Ranvir! What the fuck do we do now? This is insane!"

7946, "They did some damage. Maybe enough to slow Serkr down...save a frigate or two. It's an ugly calculus."

7947, "That's more than we managed! Tell me again how Fleet expected us to save these ships? Three of us against subspace missiles and ten million tons of...that?"

7948, "How many crew on a Narayana? Five thousand? Three thousand on a Karuna...gods, and all that in just a few minutes..."

7949, "The Akula and Ranvir are gone. They were lost before we even arrived. The Tevs had a plan, and it would have taken more than we had to stop it. So don't let yourself be taken in by thoughts of revenge."

7951, "Oh my God!"

7952, "This is Captain Lila Zhiyan of the 12th Shuduhune, heavy strike. We are on station and engaging the Serkr corvettes."

7953, "Acknowledged, Captain. We just lost the frigate Ranvir to those bastards. Where's the rest of the strike force?"

7954, "No one else is available, Brie. Our frag orders are to tie down Serkr Team and prevent it from hitting other elements of the Jovian retreat. We're expendable, Captain."

7955, "Alpha, form on those gunships and escort them in. Tackle any Tev fighters, but do not approach the Serkr corvettes. We can't withstand that hellfire."

7956, "I'm hit, I'm hit. Lot of vibration, lot of - oh, hell!"

7957, "Command, we're being shredded by antifighter fire. Mission outcome doubtful."

7958, "Captain, let's go help them out!"

7959, "I'm not going to throw away your lives unless I get a direct order. Hold your position."

7960, "It's over. I don't think poor Captain Zhiyan's squadron slowed them down one second."

GTVA forces today drove Federation forces from Jupiter, gaining control of the system capital at Ganymede. Admiral Severanti, the military commander of the battlegroup currently stationed in Sol, described this outcome as 'an important victory for our forces, and a step towards the final liberation of Earth.' Earlier, Secretary-General Toqueville gave a speech to the General Assembly, citing this recent action as the beginning of the closing stages of the civil war:

'The illegitimate ruling power in Sol has entered its twilight. Our forces have worked hard, and at great cost, to win back Earth, but we will never falter in our struggle now that our goal is finally in sight.'"

To the officers and crew of the Home Fleet,

I thank you for your hard work and dedication over the past few days. I know that it has not been easy dealing with the current influx of refugees, wounded and traffic in the aftermath of the GTVA invasion of the Jovian System Republic. Your continued dedication to the service of humanity will be both counted upon and gratefully appreciated in the next few days. All I ask is for each of you to continue the fight on the Jovians' behalf, so that we may prevail against the enemy.

The remnants of the Jovian Rim Fleet have taken up shelter in Mars orbit, where they will be repaired and their crews rested. The Jovian Republic has fought bravely ever since this war started, and now they continue to fight alongside us against those who wish to undo all the good we have achieved over the past fifty years.

Our hearts and minds are with the people of the Jovian Republic.

Hey Laporte, are you there? Those Tev bastards bombed Luna! Switch on your feed as soon as you get this. They say that a bunch of domes have been hit hard. Casualties are running into the tens of thousands and civil emergency systems have been overwhelmed. Damn them all to hell! They say the attack was aimed at industrial plants, broadcast centers, Ubuntu headquarters...they must have known how many people they'd kill.

Look, I don't know if you knew anyone at Luna or not. It doesn't matter. They've gone too far: it was different when it was the Jovians getting their noses bled. Luna is one of the biggest colonies we've got outside Earth. This is just...wrong.

Beeper from Brie. Captain Telfer wants to give us our orders. I'll see you in the briefing room."

7981, "Early this morning the $h GTVA launched simultaneous bomber attacks against targets on $g Luna and $g Mars. Nuclear detonations have been reported at several Lunar domes as well as $g Bradbury and $g Pavonis $g Mons $g Spaceport on $g Mars. Six Belt mining operations have dropped out of contact. Attacks are still ongoing, and casualties number in the tens of thousands.

These attacks on civilians violate normal Tev rules of engagement. Intel believes that the General Terran Assembly has activated the Total War contingency of the Beta Aquilae Convention. Any civilian target involved in the war effort is now fair game.

So far there have been no attacks on Earth itself. That could change."

The 170th Navajas will take a key role in operations against this destroyer. We will strike while she is still recovering her squadrons."

7986, "Ideally we'd deploy a destroyer for a direct engagement, but sending in the $g Solaris or the $g Eris would leave Earth or Mars wide open. The $g Toutatis is still undergoing repairs at Mars.

Admiral Byrne has therefore committed a frigate strike group to take out the destroyer. The Navajas will provide primary fighter cover for the attack.

Because First Fleet's strength must be conserved, Byrne has expressed reluctance to deploy more than one frigate on this op. Admiral Netreba of $g Second $g Fleet has loaned us his prize frigate, the $g Indus, in exchange for tactical command. This is therefore a joint op with the Martians."

Captain Sorensen will be calling the shots on the frigate $g Indus, accompanied by Captain Harwood's frigate $g Churchill from $f First $f Fleet.

Admiral Byrne has tagged a number of assets to support this operation, including the cruiser $g Vilnius and a pair of $g Durga bombers. They'll be called in if the situation warrants."

7990, "The $h Meridian's battle group is not a front-line $h GTVA formation. The $h Hecate is an aging carrier design, ill-suited to direct combat against warships, and her escorts also lack the killing power of newer Tev warships. Nonetheless, their beam weapons are more than adequate to neutralize two frigates. We will have to rely on good fighter tactics to cripple their weapons.

Keep those gunships safe until they deliver their payload."

7991, "Intel is curious as to why the normally cautious Severanti has extended himself so far. Perhaps he's trying to match $r Steele's recent gains and regain some favor in the eyes of his political masters.

But Severanti is not a fool, and he will have anticipated retaliation against his ship. Hit those fighters with the force of a three-ton hammerblow and his squadrons shouldn't be able to recover from the shock, let alone return to their home ship in time to defend it. Morale here is low: we need this victory. You do this right, and you'll be the envy of all other fighter squadrons in the Home Fleet."

We had a chance to drive a Tev destroyer out of the theater for at least several weeks, and possibly even destroy it. However, the opposition was too stiff.

The loss of the Indus is a tragedy. That frigate was both an icon and a valuable asset. Captain Sorenson was one of Two Fleet's best, a seasoned veteran always ready for risky assignment. He will be missed. 

You cannot be held responsible for the failure of the strike. The Tev forces you faced were well-coordinated, well-supplied, and skilled. However, Captain Lorna Simms, formerly of the Indus, has been agitating for disciplinary action against your wing, and I'm afraid she is being listened to. You will be transferred to rear-area duty, flying depot patrols from the Solaris.

Your wingmate Kassim has been placed on psychological leave. He wished to pass on a personal message, which I have forwarded to you.

Good luck on your next assignment, pilot. Be glad you won't be on the front lines again. The war is going poorly, and with the Meridian still out there launching strikes on Luna, the Elders are considering surrender in order to save civilian lives."

Your wingmate Kassim has been placed on psychological leave. He wished to pass on a personal message, which I have forwarded to you.

Good luck on your next assignment, pilot. Be glad you won't be on the front lines again. The war is going poorly, and with the Meridian still out there launching strikes on Luna, the Elders are considering surrender in order to save civilian lives."

7996, "Our attempted strike against the Meridian turned into a massacre. The Fleet Admirals are currently in emergency session in an attempt to respond to this loss. The destruction of a significant portion of the First Fleet's frigate assets reduces not only our firepower but our ability to deploy and recover fighters from multiple locations.

The loss of the Churchill and Indus is a human tragedy. Captain Harwood and Captain Sorenson died at the helms of their ships, fighting to save their crews. They will be remembered as heroes.

You cannot be held responsible for the failure of the strike. The Tev forces you faced were well-coordinated, well-supplied, and skilled. However, Captain Lorna Simms, formerly of the Indus, has been agitating for disciplinary action against your wing, and I'm afraid she is being listened to. You will be transferred to rear-area duty, flying depot patrols from the Solaris.

Your wingmate Kassim has been placed on psychological leave. He wished to pass on a personal message, which I have forwarded to you.

7997, "Welcome back to the Solaris, pilots. I apologize for the enthusiasm of the deck crews. I'll make this briefing quick so you can wash the champagne off your flightsuits.

You should all be very proud. While we were unable to destroy the Meridian, our strike succeeded in forcing the destroyer to withdraw. Intelligence tells us that the Meridian has pulled back to Delta Serpentis. Better yet, the General Assembly is so displeased with Admiral Severanti's blunder here that they've relieved him of command and placed Steele in control of the Sol theatre.

This victory has important strategic ramifications. The GTVA is unlikely to take such bold action in the future without ensuring that additional destroyers are available for reinforcement. The more forces the GTVA holds back to reinforce endangered destroyers, the fewer ships they'll have attacking on the front line.

Incidentally, Admiral Calder of the Jovian Rim Fleet happens to disagree with this assessment. Now that Admiral Severanti is no longer in the Terran theater, Calder contends that Admiral Steele of the GTD Atreus will have free reign to use more aggressive tactics. If the Jovian's right, we should all brace for worse to come.

Of course, Murphy had his way with our battle plan. As most of you know, the UEC Vilnius mis-jumped during its attack on the GTCv Juarez and was lost with all hands. This is a war. People die. What's important is that we made those deaths worth it. But that doesn't always make it easy to cope. We will remember our lost at tonight's Ceremony of the Fallen.

Those of you on the Meridian attack should take the next few days to rest. Make sure your sleep cycles are good, and see a combat psych or an Ubuntu spiritualist if you need counseling. I expect to see all of you at the Ceremony of the Fallen tonight, where we will honor our dead and, in the spirit of Ubuntu, those GTVA pilots and crewpeople who died fighting against us."

7998, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte:

It horrifies me to admit it, but that was the most fun I've had since the last sparring tournament on the Solaris. Vilnius and all.

Everything I knew about myself was wrong. I'm a stone-cold killer. I seem to like it.

I'm trying not to dwell on this. But, on a more cheerful note, I looked up the file of one Captain Lorna Simms. She's a Martian ace, a good officer, and, uh...let's say she lives up to the quality of her voice.

I think Kassim's rubbing off on me."

7999, "Welcome back to the Solaris, pilots. I apologize for the enthusiasm of the deck crews. I'll make this briefing quick so you can wash the champagne off your flightsuits.

You should all be very proud. This is a significant victory for the Federation. The loss of the Meridian is a terrible blow to the Tevs, and we've earned at least a few weeks of peace from her raids. Millions of civilian lives have been saved.

This victory also has important strategic ramifications. The GTVA is unlikely to take such bold action in the future without ensuring that additional destroyers are available for reinforcement. The more forces the GTVA holds back to reinforce endangered destroyers, the fewer ships they'll have attacking on the front line.

8000, "Additionally, it is my sad duty to report the deaths of Flight Lieutenant Javier Cosoleto, Sublieutenant Ambiro Gapar, and Ensign Tyra 'Crash' Ymir. These pilots served the Solaris well and died protecting Earth. Their deaths are doubly bitter because, like so many of the First Fleet's pilots, they were reservists. If any of you would like to add to their remembrances during the Ceremony of the Fallen, please inform me."

8001, "There was nothing you could have done to save Beta wing."

8002, "Noemi Laporte perished during the attack on the GTD Meridian.

This is not a friendly environment for an unsupported Uhlan. To safeguard your life, stay near the Delta Wing gunships. Shoot down Aquarius Wing, allow the gunships to destroy the Meridian's beams, and then rapidly pull back to the frigates. Use the frigates as cover against Libra wing, and don't forget that Gamma wing is under your command.

Once the Maxim strike arrives, use Epsilon Wing gunships to destroy it.

If you allow yourself to be drawn into a dogfight near a cruiser or the Meridian itself, you will probably die. Focus on your mission, and don't go anywhere near GTVA capital ships.

This is the first major engagement you have participated in, so don't expect to be a hero. Survival is half the battle."

8105, "Kappa Wing, 33rd Kingmakers, standing by to engage incoming Tev elements."

8106, "Here they come! Two Tev wings and a cruiser! Fangs out, fangs out - Alpha, get on their asses or we'll be torn up!"

8107, "The Meridian has escaped, but with severe damage. Hit her escorts before they withdraw too!"

8108, "It escaped? We let that ship get away? After it nuked Luna? This is unbelievable!"

8109, "She's not going to threaten our people again any time soon. That's what matters."

8110, "Shut up, both of you! Check six, watch the flak, and wrap this up!"

8111, "Solaris, this is the Indus. Mission outcome doubtful. Requesting additional support."

8112, "The Balzac decoy has been destroyed. Tev gunnery now targeting us."

8115, "I'm okay. I'm okay. Holy fuck, I'm alive! Hah!"

8116, "Typical First Fleet. Just living through a fight is a pleasant surprise. Don't get cocky, rook."

8117, "I...Christ and Allah, I think I hit a man after he ejected... I can't tell if that's blood on my wing or carbon scoring...and I can't keep my hands steady..."

8118, "Why, Captain Simms, you sound threatened. Am I infringing on your territory? Or your kill count, maybe? "

8119, "Ease up, rook. You're on a combat high. Keep that in mind before you start mouthing off to superior officers."

8120, "'Rook'? Give me your tally, Simms, and let's compare. Or are you just going to pull rank and back down?"

8121, "Sir! I'm sorry for the breach of discipline, sir. You're absolutely correct, it's my first time in major combat. Excuse my...nerves."

8122, "For what it's worth, Ensign Laporte, you did well out here. Stay on your game and you might live to mouth off at me again. It's charmingly Martian."

8123, "It's a date, sir. If you're ever on board the Solaris, just let me know, and I'll be happy to show you around."

8124, "Hahaha! You're a bold woman, Laporte. But don't push your luck. The high will pass...it always does."

8125, "Did you see the bodies, Laporte? From the Vilnius? Maybe it was just debris..."

8126, "Be good over there, Noemi. You're punch-drunk from G-LOC and combat high. I should've busted your ass for that crack at Captain Simms...but, hell, we did win. You earned it."

8127, "All pilots, Indus Tactical. We've received the withdraw order. Intel reports a Tev strike force on its way to eliminate us. Let's get out of here!"

8128, "We've lost the Indus! This operation's a botch! Everyone, get the hell out, get out now!"

8129, "We've lost the Churchill! Everyone, pull out, this operation's over! We've got to cut our losses!"

8130, "Jumping home as ordered...Solaris locked in."

8131, "Sorry, mate...better you than me..."

8132, "You'll have to do better than that!"

8133, "Sweet Fortune, I'm almost enjoying myself..."

8134, "Solaris, this is the Indus. We're taking some heat. Keep the Yangtze on standby."

8135, "Wait, wait...hold on, Brie, look at those cruisers...we're flying into a pretty serious killzone, aren't we?"

8136, "You're an Uhlan pilot. Just keep moving. Don't let the flak or beams settle on you. If you need to recharge and rearmor, get out of the pocket and call support."

8137, "Now stop being afraid and fight! DESPERTA FERRO, CHILDREN OF UBUNTU! CUT THEM DOWN!"

8138, "This is Captain Kyrematen of the Yangtze. I heard you needed some help, Lloyd. Gunnery, hit the Meridian with everything you've got!"

8139, "Laporte, get your ship out of there! Call support! You need your armor repaired and recharged!"

8140, "Ensign Laporte! Discipline, or you'll sit the next mission out in the stockade!"

8141, "All fighters, stand clear of the Juarez. Durga strike inbound. Guns hot."

8142, "Delta wing here. Strike successful. Meridian main beams offline. Now targeting the Juarez."

8143, "Fire control confirms good hits on the Meridian. Target shows armor fatigue. Maintain fire."

8144, "Target is venting heatsink coolant. Seeing some secondaries in the port-side flak magazines."

8145, "The Meridian's armor is failing. Load hive rounds and hit her again!"

8146, "Range check confirmed. Gunnery, set gauss cannons to free fire, salvo mode."

8147, "We're in knife fight range, Churchhill. All mass drivers to continuous rapid fire."

8148, "Understood, Navajas. You'll have to disarm them yourselves. This op is riding on you."

8149, "We need to take some pressure off the Churchill, or we're going to lose her."

8150, "New contact! The Tevs have deployed a Maxim strike. We're calling in the 271st to assist your intercept."

8151, "Epsilon gunships on the line. Navajas, call targets for our long-range missiles."

8152, "Epsilon wing is dry on Grimlers. Going in for guns."

8153, "Launch, launch. Paveways away."

Random screening of combat pilots has selected you for a psychological evaluation. In order to maximize the diagnostic efficiency of the evaluation, it will occur during a live sortie. You will patrol a navigation point near Earth for enemy scout wings.

I will fly your wing, interview you during your downtime, and monitor transmissions from your flightsuit's Diagnostic Neural Interface. To avoid distractions, your weapons systems will be locked unless enemy contact occurs.

Suit up. We launch in ten."

They cleared me. I have no idea why, or how, but they cleared me. The report makes it sounds like I'm the sanest woman on this side of the Council of Elders.

What the hell is going on here?

I listened to the flight transcript. I listened to my own cockpit voice records.

The things I said were utterly normal. They are not the things I remember saying. Lieutenant Vicmouth interviewed me, we completed our patrol, and then we jumped home to the Solaris. No one ever mentioned my purpose, or my childhood...not me, and not him.

I must have been blacked out the whole time. I woke up in my cockpit on the hangar deck soaked in sweat and convinced that I had finally cracked.

Who was speaking to me? More importantly...who was speaking to Lieutenant Vicmouth while I was inside my own head, having a conversation with a phantom from my childhood?

What happened out there today makes me fear for my sanity. I'm going to write to Elder Mandho.

He'll know what to do.

In the meantime, I'm just going to do my best to put it out of my mind, write it off as combat stress, and hope it doesn't happen again."

8355, "$b Message $b Received. $b Sender: $b Elder $b Martin $b Mandho $b (authenticated $b pyr3p8tt656) 
$b View? $b y/n

Dear Noemi,

I was overjoyed to receive your letter and to hear that you are well. By an old man's count of years, it was only yesterday that you were a little girl playing in the sand as I talked politics with your parents. Those memories are dear to me, especially in days as dark as these. You are everything your mother and father would have wished you to be.

Unfortunately, I am unsure if I can be of any help with your current problem. Perhaps you truly are schizophrenic. If it is so, you should make peace with your fear and seek a doctor's advice. Ubuntu is a philosophy of reality, not of mysticism, and if science can give you your answer, then by all means, press the question."

8356, "But Ubuntu also recognizes that which we perceive but which science has yet to explain. It is true that some amongst the Elders receive visions. We are not all in agreement as to what weight to give them, or as to what they mean. But we strive to see this gift in the way that our distant ancestors saw the stars: though we cannot explain the wonder, nor touch it, nor even ascribe to it the most basic traits, we nonetheless agree that it is beautiful.

I have certainly never heard of this gift assuming the form of an 'invisible friend' with a personality. However, things we have learned recently - since this war began, in fact - tell me that your gift may not be unique. If you have, in truth, heard these voices since childhood, and if your heart tells you they can be trusted, then perhaps you should heed them? At least one other with the same gift reached peace by following his own dreams.

I have known you since childhood, and knew your mother far longer. If you are as good as she, then the things you hear must be good as well. I trust you to do what is right.

Blessings and fortune to you, Noemi.

Martin Mandho"

8357, "A moment before we start this briefing. Look at the empty chairs next to you. They are a harsh lesson, maybe the harshest, that we must not forget this is a war. In war, heroes still die. In war, you do not have to carry a weapon to be a target. Finally, in a war, it is never clear who is our enemy and who is not. Like it or not, war has arrived on our doorstep, and we either adapt or surrender.

We're not going to receive any replacements to our squadron for a few days, so until then these seats will serve as a reminder of our lost comrades and the sacrifice they made in the line of duty. Remember this lesson, so that their deaths will not be in vain. Now, listen up. Our work doesn't stop with the Meridian."

8358, "We did well yesterday in ending the civilian bombings, but the situation remains grim. Our infrastructure has been hit hard by the Tevs. We're still holding on - barely. We've had some success at decentralising our supply chain, so we're going to continue our coordinated freighter traffic with Mars. 

A short time ago, the heavy freighter $f Nauticus departed from the Mars gate farm with supplies for $f Rheza $f Station as well as some classified cargo. I don't know what the hell they were thinking - it's possible they were deceived, or paid off - but the $f Nauticus left Mars without her fighter escort. "

8359, "Nauticus"

8360, "As soon as she left the main traffic lanes she came under attack by a $h Gaian $h Effort wing looking to plunder her cargo. We lost communications with the freighter about five minutes ago. However, her automated distress beacon continues to transmit, so it's likely that the ship remains intact. 

Gaian Effort activity has been on the rise for the past few months. Without Third Fleet raids to suppress their Kuiper habitats, they've built up their strength, and in spite of the war they're still committed to their radical ecoterrorist agenda. This raid is typical nuisance behavior."

8361, "Gef Forces"

8362, "Command has shut down the local gates to prevent the Gefs from escaping with the Nauticus: they'll have to drag the ship into subspace manually, which will take time. We're sending you three to the freighter's last known position: with luck the Gefs will still be preoccupied with securing the Nauticus' cargo.

The Gefs are little more than a paramilitary force. Still, be careful out there. More than one pilot has learned the hard way not to underestimate these terrorists. Your Uhlans should be more than a match for whatever the Gefs throw at you, so I expect that freighter to make it to the station intact. The Second Fleet frigate $f Yangtze is on patrol nearby, and its gunships will track and respond to any signs of Gef jump signatures."

8363, "Send those Gefs packing back to the Kuiper Belt, and bring that freighter home."

8364, "This is a private debriefing, Ensign Laporte, because I believe you are a gifted pilot, and I think you deserve the courtesy of a personal hearing regarding your actions.

You murdered a prisoner of war. While the Gef terrorists certainly have a history of prisoner abuse and degradation, we are not Gefs. If we are to maintain the moral high ground in this war then we must not stoop to the same level as our enemies. 

Your wingman, Kassim, has testified that the prisoner verbally harassed you. While he appears to view this as justification for your action, I do not. You are expected to remain calm and clear-headed even in the face of hate and rage.

Certainly the term 'warrior of Ubuntu' is something of an oxymoron. But, nonetheless, there are standards of enlightenment and conduct that we must uphold. And you have violated these standards.

In spite of the testimony of your wingmen, I must relieve of your flight status and recommend your transfer to a rear-area posting. While I am sure you'll be called up again as the war grows more desperate, this is the end of our professional acquaintance.

I'm sorry it had to be this way, Laporte."

8365, "Congratulations on your successful recovery of the Nauticus transport, Alpha Wing. Major Prathanya's EOD team found the majority of the crew locked in a hull compartment, where they'd been anesthetized.

The success of this mission was a team effort, but I think a few elements deserve particular notice.  Major Prathanya's team will receive a commendation and possibly even a medal for their heroic defusal of the comet-cracker warhead. Without their efforts, the Gefs would have destroyed the transport and most likely all of you with it.

In addition, I'd like to single out Noemi Laporte's conduct as worthy of admiration and emulation. With her commanding officer busy and an overwhelming enemy force threatening mission-critical assets, Laporte took control of the situation and maintained fire discipline. Thanks to her courage, the Gefs were unable to chase Alpha wing away from the transport, and the situation was successfully resolved. Excellent work, Laporte.

The Nauticus' classified cargo has been transferred to the Solaris and is now being escorted under heavy guard to its final destination. The Nauticus' captain is still in recovery, but once he's fully conscious, Admiral Byrne is going to grill him about his decision to leave Mars without a proper escort. I expect that by the time Byrne is done that captain will wish he had died at the hands of the Gefs.

Lastly, the Gef prisoner you recovered has been transferred to Fleet Intelligence for debriefing. Under normal circumstances we'd allow the Hostile Combatants Advocacy Branch access to the prisoner, but the Fleet Admirals have issued an executive order mandating closed interrogation. Extraordinary times, ladies and gentlemen.

A moment, Laporte? Brie passed me some of the mission logs. I'd just like to commend your conduct, both in the tangle with the Gefs and with respect to your cooperation with the EOD team. We need leadership like that. I may give you more responsibility in the months to come."

8366, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

That was tense. I came close to firing on the Gefs more than once...I can only imagine how Kassim must've struggled. But, in the end, I guess they didn't want to risk starting a firefight around the transport.

Uncle Manuel has been beaming at me all day. I think I impressed him."

Your tangle with the Gef squadron was a tense, charged situation, and I'm not surprised you elected to open fire. In fact, I'm going to guess you lured the Gefs in range of their own bomb before engaging so they couldn't detonate it. Well done, Laporte

8368, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

That was tense. I'm not sure firing was the right decision...we were pretty seriously outnumbered. But if I hadn't shot, the Gefs would've. And in the end we survived. I guess that's what counts.

Kassim's nerves are looking more and more frayed. He's been acting strangely. I think I'd better try to find him and calm him down."

Noemi Laporte did a difficult thing out there today. We've all been trained to treat prisoners with the utmost respect. But Laporte recognized a critical situation and acted to resolve it. By threatening that hostage, you may have crossed some ethical boundaries, but you also ensured the success of your mission.

8372, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

I killed her. She begged when she died. I can't stop hearing her voice. I keep meaning to go see one of the combat shrinks but I never do. Ken's going to have a field day with this next time I manage to fall asleep. I need to see a shrink, just in case this psychosis is going to get more serious.

Kassim won't look at me."

Without their efforts, the Gefs would have destroyed the transport and most likely all of you with it.

There are pilots, and then there are warriors. Noemi Laporte proved herself a warrior today. Laporte, your decision to assault the Gef force while outnumbered and threatened by a live bomb was, arguably, insane. But it paid off, and that is a testament to your piloting skills and your judgment. I wouldn't have made the same call, but in times like this, gambles are sometimes what we need.

I can't believe we survived that firefight. Fifteen to three...it was madness. I don't know what I did. Ken's going to have a field day with this next time I manage to fall asleep. I need to see a shrink, just in case this psychosis is going to get more serious.

Kassim had something of a breakdown after we landed. I think he's...very afraid, under there. I should talk to him."

8375, "Somehow you managed to bungle this operation completely. You lost the Nauticus, its crew, and the vital cargo. I can't say too much, but from what I know, the loss of that cargo just set back a critical project by months and may have lost us our one chance at delaying Earth's fall.

I know you're good pilots, which makes it doubly difficult to understand how this mission could've gone so poorly. The Gefs are untrained rabble!

I'd like to keep you, but I'm afraid Admiral Byrne is furious. You three are being shipped Earth-side for transfer to a support ship squadron. Check over your rearm training modules and get your affairs in order -  the life expectancy for front-line support ship pilots is less than three missions."

8433, "Alpha wing, stay clear of the Nauticus! If that thing so much as jolts, everything could get blown sky-high."

8434, "Nauticus control, this is Alpha wing of the 170th Fighting Navajas, UED Solaris. Please respond."

8435, "Damn hypocrites. For all their rhetoric, these Gefs sure don't seem to have much trouble taking human lives."

8437, "I say again Nauticus control, this is Alpha wing. Please respond."

8438, "Nothing. Either their short-wave transmitters are dead or the crew is."

8439, "Kassim, are you okay? You've been in a daze ever since the briefing. "

8440, "Never better, Laporte. I'm alive, I've got all my limbs and digits...got no damn reason to complain."

8441, "Command, Alpha 1. No response from the Nauticus bridge. There is an explosive device in the cargo hold that's rigged to blow. No other enemy craft in the area."

8442, "Roger that, Alpha 1. We're deploying a boarding party with an explosives team to recapture the freighter. Stand by."

8443, "I wasn't asking you to complain, Kassim, I was asking if you were all right."

8444, "Keep it frosty, Alpha. We still have a job to do here."

8445, "You heard the man, Laporte. Let's just keep our minds on why we're here, ok?"

8446, "So why are we here, Kassim? I spend a lot of time wondering."

8447, "You're out here to kill anyone who tries to kill you. At this specific moment, you're here to kill Gefs so that they don't take our cargo ship. Isn't it that simple?"

8448, "No. It's never that simple. You can't just kill people because they're trying to kill you, you've got to understand why. You have to do what's right."

8449, "What's right...kind of a tricky proposition, isn't it? I mean, we think we're right. So do the Gefs. The Tevs too, judging by those broadcasts. Everyone's got their reasons."

8450, "I remember a young girl saying she wanted to join the Navy fighter corps to follow in the footsteps of her Uncle Manny and her father."

8451, "I guess I did...but...I don't really know what it was that gave me the idea. Might have been some crazy dream."

8452, "Whatever, Laporte. My reasons don't go beyond flying a big fighter, shooting bad guys and showing off my wings when I'm planet-side."

8453, "Pisces wing is out of the fight. Check your telltales, and call in a support ship to rearmor if you need to."

8454, "Alpha, Nairobi Wind. We've successfully completed our transit. The EOD team is on board. They're not too happy."

8455, "Why? What's wrong?"

8456, "Just the grind taking its toll, Alpha 1. Constant deployments, no food, no sleep, a lot of stims, a lot of fear. These guys don't have it easy."

8457, "Pardon me, One. Could you put the EOD leader on, Nairobi Wind?"

8458, "Major Prathanya here. What is it?"

8459, "Just wanted to ensure everything was all right before you began your mission, Major. Anything we can do?"

8460, "Aside from six days' rest and a vacation in Tahiti? No. My team just finished pulling a live Helios warhead out of the Katana's flight deck. This should be a piece of piss."

8461, "Don't worry, Major. We'll make sure you have a smooth ride. Alpha One, should we pass them our scan data?"

8462, "We can use anything you've got. Detonators, types of fissionables, mass, brisance...we need to know as much as we can before we start RSP."

8463, "Hang on, hang on, everyone be quiet...I'm getting a signal near the Nauticus."

8464, "Catching...it's a suit distress beacon. Someone must have ejected and only now switched their beacon on."

8465, "Let's go find it, Laporte. They might be injured."

8466, "Good idea, Noemi. I'd frankly forgotten this section of the manual. We're passing you our scan data via FLEETNET, Major."

8467, "Noemi! Why the hell did you do that? That was a helpless victim, not a target! Get yourself back to base and turn yourself in to the combat clinic. You're a danger to yourself and your squadmates."

8468, "I'm sorry, Uncle...I don't know what happened. I just...the combat stress, I guess. I'll go get myself examined and report what happened to Telfer."

8469, "Attention, Gef pilot. This is Alpha 2, 170th Fighting Navajas, UED Solaris. You are hereby a prisoner of war."

8470, "Rot and die, you worm!"

8471, "Friendly sort, isn't she?"

8472, "Another charming daughter of the Kuiper Belt. I'll call the SAR Corsair. Whether she wants it or not, she's going back to the Solaris."

8473, "Easy now, pilot. We're not going to hurt you. What's your name?"

8474, "What the hell is this? Who do you think you are, little woman, a fucking snake charmer? I'm a hostile pilot and you're a worthless planet-raping buntu. Stop playing flower girl, you naif."

8475, "...ow."

8476, "Watch your tongue, prisoner. That's my niece. Treat her with the respect due to your betters."

8477, "Your niece? You've got family members flying in the same wing? Hahahaha! You Terrans are a joke! At least the Jovians acted like a real military! Not that it did them much good when the Tevs decided to roll over them, did it?"

8478, "I've heard enough. She's jammed."

8479, "Heads up, heads up, jump flash! Hostiles coming in!"

8480, "Sweet fortune, it's a whole squadron of Gefs!"

8481, "They'd never risk this many ships for a single freighter. Hey, do you see that? Isn't that a GTVA tactical transport?"

8482, "Hold! Everyone hold! Wait for them to move! Major Prathanya, what's your status?"

8483, "This is Major Prathanya. We've deployed drones into the Nauticus. No sign of the crew. We're attempting to isolate the warhead's software connection to shipboard sensors. Stand by. "

8484, "Alpha 1, you need to remain calm. We're in the middle of some delicate work here. The warhead has air displacement sensors and our drones very nearly set them off."

8485, "Listen carefully, Major. A Gef force has jumped in and might attack at any moment. I need you to find any kind of remote trigger on that bomb and disable it now. I'm signaling nearby units for backup."

8486, "That's totally impractical. We're not even ready to begin preliminary RSP, let alone defuse. You need to buy us more time."

8487, "Buntu fighters. This is Sergei Gwilym of the Gaian Effort, Kostadin Cell. I have the detonation codes for that comet-cracker. Surrender the Nauticus and your own ships or I'll blow you all to hell. You have thirty seconds."

8488, "Oh, shit..."

8489, "Gef pilot, this is Alpha Wing, 170th Fighting Navajas, UED Solaris. We give nothing to Kuiper rabble. Furthermore, if you set off your bomb, you lose the Nauticus. Your pilots will have died for nothing."

8490, "Twenty-six. Twenty-five. Twenty-four."

8491, "Brie, this is Major Prathanya! We need your avionics package for some detail work, or we might trigger the bomb! Scan the coordinates I'm passing on right away!"

8492, "Damn it! Roger that, Major, on my way. Noemi, talk to them! Buy us some time!"

8493, "You're bluffing, Gef. You obviously want this transport too badly to destroy it."

8494, "I can hear how scared you are, buntu girl. You know how irrational we can be, neh? Fanatics, you say? Maybe I forget about the transport in my rage and just decide to blow you up?"

8495, "Well, in that case, I'll put a few rounds into this transport myself. Might as well get it over with, right?"

8496, "Kill yourself, your friends, and the Nauticus crew? Stupid. How 'bout you just leave, and we let the crew live? Best way out, neh?"

8497, "If you come close enough to board or dogfight, I'll take out the Nauticus and all of us with it. And you won't scare us away."

8498, "We'll see about that, buntu girl. All right, brothers and sisters! Close in and jostle 'em, but don't fire yet. Let's see if the little buntu's got the nerve she lays claim to!"

8499, "$1$ - Call His Bluff

$3$ - Just Attack"

8500, "Laporte, they're coming right at us! I'm going weapons hot!"

8501, "Weapons tight, Kassim! Brie, Nairobi Wind, don't shoot until they do! I don't think they're going to risk us firing on the Nauticus...don't let them intimidate you."

8502, "She opened fire! Blow her away!"

8503, "They're all over us! They keep pulling into my killslot! Someone's going to shoot and then I'm going home in a bag, Laporte! I'm going to die!"

8504, "Hold fast! Noemi's right! The longer we keep them dancing out here, trying to frighten us off, the closer the Major gets to disarming that bomb!"

8505, "Alpha, come in! Alpha wing, the bomb's disarmed. I thought we were done for, but we got the remote detonator disconnected."

8506, "Excellent! Now...how do we get out of this damn furball? Hadn't thought that far ahead..."

8507, "Stand by, Alpha Wing. This is Flight Lieutenant Karen Ng-Mei off the Yangtze. We tracked Gef raiders to this area, Navajas, and we're here to help. We'll draw the Gefs off."

8508, "<intercepted> Buntu gunships are after the Argo! Set the bomb for fifteen seconds and then jump out! At least we'll get some of them!"

8509, "<intercepted> The warhead's not responding! The Feds must have disarmed it!"

8510, "<intercepted> Jump home if you can, Scimitars, triple-joint pattern! We blew this one hard!"

8511, "Roger that, Lieutenant Ng-Mei. It's beautiful to see you."

8512, "Sorry we're so late, Alpha wing. Our first track of the Gef jump trajectory was significantly off. They're canny prey."

8513, "We're just glad you got here at all, Flight Lieutenant. I was afraid we'd be dancing with those Gefs forever."

8514, "Wow, Laporte, I don't know how you kept your cool. I thought...god, I thought I was going to die. I'm not ready...god, that was too much."

8515, "Laporte? Noemi Laporte? Lorna Simms off the Indus mentioned her..."

8516, "Me!? She remembered me? Wait, you know Lorna Simms? Aren't you on a different ship? Do you talk very often? Is she...uh, nice? I mean, not that I'm that curious, but she was very...uh, I mean, we met, after the Meridian attack. I...I admire her combat record."

8517, "We traded a few words on FLEETNET, since the Indus is in for repairs. She said...something about you. You did well during the strike...or was it striking? Can't remember. Strike or striking."

8518, "What the hell is wrong with you people? We almost died! How can you joke around like this after..."

8519, "Kassim, shut your mouth. The area seems secure, Lieutenant Ng-Mei, and we're all rattled. With your permission, we'll head back to the Solaris to debrief."

8520, "Go ahead, Navajas. We've got the Nauticus and the EOD team covered. Marines and an SAR Corsair will be here to tow her home. Good flying, pilots."

8521, "Thanks for the cover, Alpha. Glad we could save your pilot asses, for a change. Major Prathanya out."

8522, "Splashed a bandit. Gef scum."

8523, "Gef splashed! Someone's going to be buying me drinks..."

8524, "The freighter's about to blow! Alpha wing, jump jump jump!"

8525, "Attention Gef terrorists. I am Noemi Laporte. I know your ship sensors can read the suit beacon of the Gef prisoner we've taken."

8526, "Are you threatening a prisoner of war, little buntu girl?"

8527, "You're damn right I am. Bring your ships any closer, and I'll burn her alive with my engine exhaust. Suit radios are a lot more hardy than the human body. You'll hear her scream...at least until her lungs incinerate."

8528, "You're younger than my daughter. Raised on Earth, coddled and comfortable, neh? You could never do what you threaten! You are too soft!"

8529, "Maybe you're right, Sergei Gwilym. Maybe I couldn't bring myself to kill that woman. But if you come five hundred meters closer, then we're both going to find out...and I don't think either of us will like what we learn."

8530, "Wretched, cowardly buntu bitch! Who's playing terrorist now, eh? If you were drifting in a suit off my wing, I'd at least give you a clean death!"

8531, "Gaia save us. What do those wretched Elders do to make you so hard? So young, but so cold..."

8532, "...no. You would never be able to kill her. Her name is Ghanna. When she was young, she grew cherry blossoms in little cups to give to the pilots. She loves a man named - <CHANNEL CLOSED>"

8533, "Kassim, unjam the prisoner's radio."

8534, "What are you going to do, Laporte?"

8535, "I don't know yet..."

8536, "Laporte! They're coming in! All of them, weapons hot! You have to do something, or they're going to swarm us! "

8537, "Your pilot is dead, Gef. She went out like a helpless, screaming babe. I hope you heard it, because now I'm going to kill every one of you. I hope you scream like her."

8538, "MERCY! PLEASE! OH, GOD, PLEASE - "

8539, "...she's just a girl! At her! We - we'll rip em up, don't worry! Come on, butcher them!"

8540, "Damn, Laporte...they're all flying like they expect the wrath of God to crash down on them any moment."

8541, "I will do it. I will kill her!"

8542, "...damn it. Damn it! Break off! Get back to the Argo and hold for my orders!"

8543, "...not like this. I just don't want to go like this. Please not like this."

8544, "I won't beg! I won't! Do your worst, you buntu bitch!"

8545, "Good to see you, Flight Lieutenant. Those were a harrowing few minutes."

8546, "Man, Laporte. I...didn't know you had such a vicious streak going. I...god, I thought I was going to die."

8547, "Wait, you know Lorna Simms? Aren't you on a different ship? Do you talk very often? Look, please don't tell her about...what I did. She might not think much of it."

8548, "She's a hardass herself, Laporte. Lorna and the Indus take the worst assignments. She mentioned she'd found some pictures of you...something from your academy days?"

8549, "Can't you people stop this inane chatter after every mission? We almost died! How can you just..."

8550, "Well, I don't have any bright ideas...Kassim, should we just kill them all?"

8551, "What? We're outnumbered fifteen to three...we'll never make it!"

8552, "I think I can pull it off. Where's your legendary recklessness, Kassim?"

8553, "Aw, hell. Why not? Also, Laporte, there's one more thing..."

8554, "...aw, never mind. Let's waste these chlorophiles!"

8555, "What is it, Kassim?"

8556, "We're attacking? Are you mad? ...well, then, let's give it a shot!"

8571, "$h Red $h Alert! All officers and crew of the UED Solaris, this is Admiral Byrne declaring an emergency.

A Galactic Terran attack is in progress on our Earth and Lunar space-based assets. Repeat, a massive enemy assault on major installations in Earth and Lunar orbit is in progress. Galactic Terran forces of the $r GTD $r Imperieuse battlegroup have overwhelmed our defences at several key positions. Our garrison at Luna has fallen, and we've lost contact with our battle line at $f Kansas $f Station. Our forces have rallied around $f Home $f Fleet $f HQ, and reinforcements from the $f Second $f Fleet are incoming.

All squadrons are to prepare for launch, effective immediately. All pilots, report to your squadron leaders for briefing and await further orders. Solaris crew, report to battle stations. Deck personnel, refer to launch rotation schedules which will be posted at all info terminals. 

I want reports of battle-readiness from all stations in five minutes. It's time for everyone to give their all for our homes, and our planet. Earth's darkest hour has finally arrived."

8572, "Ok pilots, listen up! Admiral Byrne has called for a full-strength deployment. Everyone fights today.

You're being deployed to $g Rheza $g Station, a critical regional hub and dockyard for the $g Home $g Fleet. She's come under attack by Tev forces and her garrison just made the call for reinforcements. Latest reports from the station indicate the Deimos corvette $h Redoubtable bombarding the station with beam fire under cover from a squadron of fighters. However, be advised that the situation is highly fluid. If the Tevs start taking losses, expect the $h Imperieuse to deploy additional fighters and bombers. They'll put as many craft into the attack as they can without depleting their own reserves and leaving their destroyers vulnerable."

8573, "Rheza Station"

8574, "Redoubtable"

8575, "Athens Station"

8576, "Malta Station"

8577, "Because there is no Tev $h AWACS in the area to relay coordinates, expect bombers to jump in at a safe distance of at least 4000 meters. 

What we know of the Tev OrBat suggests that you will be facing the $h 908th $h Trailblazers in an assault role, the $h 909th in space superiority, and the $h 11th $h Strategic $h Assault squadron as the heavy hitters.

$f Athens and $f Malta $f Stations share an orbital slot with $f Rheza. These installations handle active armor and munitions logistics for nearby dockyards. These are important assets, but compared to $f Rheza, they're expendable. Ignore them, pilots. There's nothing you can do for them."

8578, "908th Trailblazers"

8579, "11th Strategic Assault"

8580, "Admiral Byrne plans to launch everything we've got that can fly, and we're shoving trainees into fighters as fast as we can find flightsuits. This is it, people. This is the fight for our Federation. We lose this one, then it's game over.

Our replacement pilots arrived only yesterday and I imagine you haven't had a chance to meet them. Too late now. They'll be filling out your wings. Brie, you'll be leading $g Alpha wing and handling coordination with the Solaris. Laporte, you have command of $g Beta wing and any other wings that arrive. Sorry to put you in tactical command, Ensign, but there's no one else to do the job. Try to keep our new pilots alive.

Your launch window is in seven minutes. Get to your ships and get to them now!"

8581, "Laporte. Listen up.

Those rooks you're taking out have just barely finished their ACM training. I need you to keep them together and keep them safe. Instead of letting them engage on their own, or giving them a target to defend, tell them to attack one enemy at a time, engaging as a group.

Think of them as another weapon, one you aim with your orders.

If Rheza launches any of its own rookie wings later in the battle, feel free to give them orders as well. Your command software should autoconfigure."

8582, "Beta Wing"

8583, "Welcome back to the Solaris, Navajas...those of you who survived.

Today was a massacre. The GTD Imperieuse's squadrons blitzed the entire Sol Sector in a single, massive coordinated strike. We lost five warships, including a frigate, and nearly sixty orbital installations. Our shipyards, munitions depots, orbital foundries, rally points, workup stations, fuel and reactor booms, and navigational infrastructure have been decimated. Analysts suggest it'll take five years to fully repair the damage.

Twenty minutes into the assault, the Martian Second Fleet responded en masse, striking against the Imperieuse's deployed forces as well as Tev rear areas around Jupiter. Thanks to Admiral Netreba's swift intervention, we were able to preserve our truly critical installations and retain our basic warfighting abilities. We will fight on.

Your defense of Rheza was a key element of that resistance. The Tevs never sent a truly crushing force, but thanks to your skill and careful deployment of the Third Fleet's two surviving artillery ships, you held Rheza. It will keep our ships armed, fueled, and repaired for months to come. 

The loss of the Vatican is a tragedy, but we can rest easy knowing that her crew gave their lives to preserve our Federation and way of life.

The Imperieuse has withdrawn to Delta Serpentis to restock its squadrons. We have earned ourselves some breathing room...but at a price.

As you can see from the empty seats, the Navajas took 70% casualties today. The squadron is being disbanded, and our surviving pilots transferred. It has truly been an honor to serve as your commander.

We will fly our final sortie tomorrow."

8584, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

We died by the tens of thousands today. At least we killed some of them back.

There's a layer of soot on my ship, vaporized effluvia from the death of the Valerie. Some significant fraction of it is made of dead GTVA crewmen. When I climbed out of the cockpit I got it on my hands and my face and all over my flightsuit.

I haven't washed."

8585, "Welcome back to the Solaris, Navajas.

Today was a massacre. The GTD Imperieuse's squadrons blitzed the entire Sol Sector in a single, massive coordinated strike. We lost nine warships, including three frigates, and nearly sixty orbital installations. Our shipyards, munitions depots, orbital foundries, rally points, workup stations, fuel and reactor booms, and navigational infrastructure have been decimated. Analysts suggest it'll take five years to fully repair the damage.

Twenty minutes into the blitz, the Martian Second Fleet responded en masse, striking against the Imperieuse's deployed forces as well as Tev rear areas around Jupiter. In spite of our losses it seemed we might hold the truly critical installations and preserve our fleet and basic warfighting abilities.

But the loss of Rheza Station pushed us past our combat loss grouping as a military. We've lost a key subspace trajectory tracer, retrograde repair point, and dockyard for the First Fleet. Even as we speak, Tev bombers from Steele's own squadrons are jumping in through the blind spot and entering Earth's atmosphere. We could've lost Rheza and fought on, but combined with our other losses...

The Elders made the decision to surrender ten minutes after Rheza fell. Don't blame yourselves. There was nothing you could've done. We lost this war before it ever started.

For the last time, Navajas...dismissed."

8586, "Use your wingmen as a weapon. Use C-3-1 to order them all to gang up on a single target, and take enemies out one by one. Scorpio Wing should be your first target.

Keep the Vatican alive. Disarm the Redoubtable's main beams.

When the final attack comes, take out the bomber escort fighters first, then the bombers, and finally the AWACS. With their escorts gone, the bombers are easy pickings. 

Once the Valerie arrives, be sure to shoot down its three bombers. The Indus and its fighters can handle themselves against the Valerie."

8680, "Omega gunships now on station. Targeting the Redoubtable."

8681, "Nice shooting. They won't keep throwing bombers at us with losses like that."

8682, "Looks like they agree. We have three AWACS jumping in. I'm reading an SSM strike link on the air - take them out NOW!"

8683, "Pilots, nullify those AWACS as fast as possible. They're vectoring in subspace missiles from the GTD Atreus."

8690, "This mission just gets better and better. She's deploying wings from her fighterbay."

8691, "This corvette can and will kill Rheza. What are your orders, boss?"

8692, "I'm going to call for backup. Stand clear of the Valerie."

8693, "Solaris Flight, Navaja Alpha. We have a Diomedes combatant at the Rheza perimeter. Request gunship strike!"

8694, "Sorry, Rheza. The Tevs are pressing hard all across the sector. We have nothing. We'll pass your request to Second Fleet."

8695, "Looks like this is the coup de grace. We appreciate your efforts, Navajas."

8696, "Oh, screw this! Where's the 'strategic reserve' now?"

8697, "Incoming jump signature! It's one of ours!"

8698, "This is the UEFg Indus, Second Fleet. Mars is responding to the Tev blitz. We've been deployed to take some pressure off you Earthers."

8699, "Sorry we're late, Rheza. We were initially scrambled to attack the Atreus, but Admiral Steele keeps jumping away."

8700, "Apology accepted, Indus. You're the most welcome thing in the world right now."

8701, "Hit that corvette before it guts the Indus! We're the gods of war, people! Show them a Martian welcome!"

8703, "<intercepted> We've got trouble, Command. Our jump drives are still cold and we've got a Karuna on the scene. Opening up our broadside."

8704, "Our hull has sustained moderate damage and we're losing pressure in our active armor. We're preparing to evacuate all civilian and non-essential personnel. Buy us time, pilots!"

8705, "Sigma wing is away. The rest of us are staying."

8706, "<intercepted> Command, Valerie. Penetration to inner compartments is imminent. If we don't make it, raise a glass for us on Earth."

8707, "Status check, pilots! Who made it through?"

8708, "Don't get comfortable, Earthers! They could sortie a Chimera or a Bellerophon at any minute, and we'll only have seconds to take the beams out."

8709, "We gave them a bloody nose, Simms. They're not used to that. Maybe they're reprioritizing assets to other targets."

8710, "Yeah, don't count on that. Admiral Steele doesn't play by the old rules."

8711, "The Valerie is a threat no more. That's another chevron for the prow."

8715, "So it's true, what they say. He's insane."

8716, "Not insane. Reckless, relentless, and lucky. He's a gentleman psychopath."

8717, "The situation is impossible, pilots. Her pulse weapons will suppress you and the spinal beam will gut us. Get your people out, Indus. We'll try to evacuate as many people as we can before we go down."

8718, "As much as that would benefit us, Rheza Station, we're not going anywhere. We'll hold off the Atreus and buy you time."

8719, "This isn't Artemis Station, Indus! Your suicide isn't going to help anyone!"

8720, "You're right, Rheza. This isn't Jupiter. This is Earth. Birthplace of humanity. And Admiral Steele will take this station only when it's stained Mars-red with our blood."

8721, "Gunnery control! Prepare missile tubes for salvo fire! Helm, approach at full speed. I want us as close to that destroyer as possible. Forward railguns, load sabot and fire as you bear!"

8723, "This is the UEFg Vikrant to the GTD Atreus. Fleet Admiral Calder of Jupiter sent us to hunt you down, Steele. Surrender your ship, or be destroyed."

8724, "Vikrant, this is Admiral Steele. My compliments to Admiral Calder, and my respect to your crews. If you want my surrender you'll have to earn it."

8725, "Admiral Calder thought you'd play the romantic. We have no intention of walking into your abattoire, Steele. Tactical, crack the capacitors, load sabot, and open fire!"

8726, "Tell your Admiral that some day we'll dance our little dance to the end - but not today, Vikrant. Not today. My compliments on a match well played. Helm, take us back to Jupiter."

8727, "The Atreus has jumped! It's flat-out impossible, but I'll be damned if I'm going to protest! We made it!"

8728, "We made it? ...we made it. We're tallying our survivors now. Indus, Vikrant, Toreador: our heartfelt thanks. We would all be dead now if not for your timely arrival."

8729, "Are you still in one piece, Laporte?"

8730, "It was our duty and deserves no thanks, Rheza. But Steele still evades us. We will have our revenge for Jupiter."

8731, "Shit. My hands are shaking. I can never tell if I'm afraid or exhilarated...especially not afterwards."

8732, "Is that Laporte? From the Meridian mission? You're still alive? I'm impressed."

8733, "I muddle by despite myself, sir. Do you always make such a stunning entrance?"

8734, "Only for you, Laporte. It seems you're quite a pilot. You're well on your way to a spot on the all-Fleet leaderboard, if reports are to be believed."

8735, "So your friend Ng'Mei mentioned me. Guess I haven't been the only one checking out Fleetnet profiles, have I, sir?"

8736, "It's strictly professional interest, Laporte. I'm Second Fleet Mars, you're Terran. Besides, you've still got that rookie timer on your shoulder...tick tick dead."

8737, "Laporte, it amazes me how much your personality regresses after combat."

8738, "Combat high, Uncle Manuel. I'm just ecstatic that we won today. If we keep pulling off victories like this..."

8739, "- can anyone confirm that the Saab shipyards are gone? Does someone have a visual? There must be surviving fighters -"

8743, "...my God."

8744, "Navajas, you've been recalled to the Solaris. Vikrant, Toreador, you're needed at Luna to handle a hunter-killer group. Indus, you'll remain on station here in case of Tev follow-up raids."

8745, "Understood, Rheza. Farewell, Laporte. I'm sure we'll run into each other again in the future...it's an increasingly small fleet, after all."

8746, "Victory? Laporte, check the Fleet general tactical net..."

8747, "We lost the Indus! This defensive position is no longer tenable! Rheza, evacuate immediately, and all survivors pull out now!"

8748, "Captain Sorensen! Indus! God damn it, no!"

8749, "Roger that...jumping out now. Damn it. Damn!"

8750, "Jump flash! The Tevs just sortied a half squadron of strike bombers. No escort...maybe they're getting cocky."

How the hell did this happen?

I have been warning you since before the fall of Europa that Steele is the most dangerous commander the Tevs have. He is not going to dick around conserving resources and fighting an 'inexorable attritive war' like Severanti. He wants this war over. He hates the waste of life almost as much as he loves the chance to fight.

I told you he'd go for the throat. Now we're looking at logistical collapse within the year unless we cut our fleet in half - if that doesn't happen on its own. On top of that Byrne continues to insist on diverting critical supplies to his damn 'priority operation'.

You should've given me your ships when I needed them, Byrne. Not squandered the Home Fleet defending the Elders' mysterious 'project'.

If we do not break out of our defensive rut, within three months we are all going to answer for it at the gallows.

-Admiral Calder, Commander
Jovian Rim Fleet (In Exile)"

8771, "To the Officers and Crew of the UED Solaris,

InSec has recently become aware that a document was posted publicly on FleetNet labeled as a compartmentalized Admiralty communique.

Although the source claims to be a disgruntled Jovian comms officer, I am sure none of you are naive enough to believe this obvious fabrication. GTVI continues its PsyOps in an effort to wear down our morale and cohesion.

If you hear scuttlebutt about this message, defeat it as you would any other enemy.

This is Paula Hunter, Alliance Embedded News, reporting in the field on board Artemis Station in the Sol system. Several days ago GTVA forces launched a truly enormous coordinated attack against UEF naval infrastructure in the space around Earth itself. This is a huge, a really huge - am I getting through, Chen? - all right, sorry, yes, this is an enormous change in strategy from what we saw under Admiral Severanti.

In an interview yesterday Admiral Steele told us that he wants this war over by the end of the year and he's willing to take risks to do it.

$quoteI want one thing to be clear: we will suffer losses. I'm not going to grind away five hundred thousand lives on both sides when we could spend a few thousand now and achieve victory. We need to show the UEF the rules of the game: there are no rules. These people are fragile. They haven't seen what we've seen, or fought our battles. Push them and they will break.$quote

Now, a lot of pundits have criticized this change in strategy as an unnecessary risk, and I know there's been a lot of footage of damaged ships coming home, or news about lost squadrons. But let me tell you, the damage inflicted by Steele's attacks is just so much more -

8774, "$b Message $b Received - $b Sender: $b Manuel $b Brie

For the attention of Sub-Lieutenant Laporte,

Hello Noemi. I ran into Kassim last night. He was in his civies at the Rec room. I asked him where he had been the past couple of days. He said he was heading back to Earth, and wasn't going to take any more part in this war. It turns out he missed the squadron briefing when the Tevs attacked Earth. Captain Telfer eventually found him in his bunk, up to his ears in rocket fuel. He got an immediate court-martial, and was determined psychologically unfit to continue in the Navy. He leaves for Earth tomorrow, and they're setting him up in a Government centre for some spiritual therapy.

It's sad that the Navajas are being broken up, but to lose Kassim as well makes it all that much more difficult. He had the manners of a hog in heat and half the charm, but he was a good pilot, a reliable friend. Like Captain Telfer said though: this is war. War doesn't stop for anyone. It is a machine that carries on without us, and we either continue on with it or we die."

8775, "Let me tell you something that I always told your parents: No matter what life throws at us, we always have a choice in how we receive it. Most of us aren't born great. It's a conscious decision that we make at some point in our lives that propels us to do great things. You're still at the beginning of your adult life, but the choices you've made in this war have shown me that you are quite capable of determining your own destiny. It is therefore with no fear that I let you go into the unknown by yourself without me to guide you.

I'm going to Rheza Station to help out with the training of new pilots. I've been flying Navy birds for more than twenty years, and this is probably the most useful thing I can do in this war. My reactions aren't what they were fifteen, twenty years ago and the front is no place for a person like me. Who would have thought, Laporte, that out of the three of us you'd be the only one of us moving forward, not back.

I'll send you a message when I get a spare moment.

With love, your Uncle Manuel."

8776, "Morning, Fighting Navajas. This will be your last sortie before everyone goes to their new postings, so let's make this a good one, all right?

Here's the situation. About fifteen minutes ago, we received an automated distress call from one of our cruisers, the $g Dea $g Icaunis. She was transferring some non-essential materials from Mars to Earth and serving as a base and rally point for local patrols. We can't establish communications with the cruiser, so we've assumed that she must have fallen under some distress. Admiral Byrne has ordered us to send a wing to investigate the fate of the $g Icaunis."

8777, "Dea Icaunis"

8778, "This is not a recon mission. We suspect enemy action to be the cause of the cruiser's distress. $h GTVA forces have withdrawn from regional space after the $g Second $g Fleet's maneuvers, but we've detected some remnants that haven't joined up with the Tev fleet at Europa. This could be a retaliatory action. We need you to proceed with caution, and be ready for a fight as soon as you enter the area.

Beta wing will serve as backup. Because of Brie's departure, you'll be taking Alpha wing, Laporte. Your recent action at Rheza Station has proven that you've got the capability for field leadership. I've already made a statement in your FleetNet record for your next squadron leader. Do us proud, Sub-Lieutenant."

8779, "Hostile Action"

8780, "Alpha Wing"

8781, "Hey! Hey, Laporte! It's Vineto. Camerone's checking something with the deck crew.

When we get back, let's take a few minutes to remember the Navajas, all right? Captain Telfer could use a little cheering up.

Congratulations on your promotion, too. You deserve it. You're handling all this better than most of us."

8782, "Camerone, Laporte, welcome back to the Solaris. We don't have a briefing room any more so we're going to do this over coffee. Cream, Sublieutenant?

I'm sorry about Vineto. He went down fighting the best. His parents are gonna be real torn up, but real proud.

Okay. I have no more idea than you do why the Tevs were so eager to board the Dea Icaunis. Their strike was under-supported and desperate. The ships you engaged were from the 41st Bengals, off the GTD Imperieuse - they should've been in Delta Serpentis with their base ship.

Our best theory at the moment concerns one of the prisoners the Dea Icaunis was transporting. Captain Esmar Al'Fadil of the 41st Bengals surrendered himself to UEF custody during a failed attack on the Jakarta Station dockyards. So far as we can tell, members of his squadron went rogue in order to rescue him from what they perceived as a fate worse than death.

It's...hard for me to think about, I'll admit. Ubuntu taught us all to never treat a human being as a thing. But if we're going to go out there and kill them, we...can't know things like this. Things like how much these pilots loved their commander. I know I couldn't pull the trigger if I had to think about that.

Ah, never mind. Laporte, you look shaky as hell. You should get some rack time."

8783, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

Xinny. Zero. Rabbit. Dishes. Camel. Bonk. Eyes. Chavel.

Who were they? How long had they known each other?

Why did they have to go after their Captain? Why did they have to make me kill them?

Usually I can handle it. But this time...somehow it just doesn't feel fair."

8784, "It's good to have you back, Noemi.

I know it's odd to be debriefed in a sickbay bunk. Beta Wing found you in your cockpit with a shrapnel wound and a paucity of blood. It looks like you passed out after taking a pretty serious hit.

We're not completely certain what happened out there. Neither Vineto nor Camerone made it home to report, and the Dea Icaunis was boarded by GTVA marines. According to your flight data recorders, you engaged a wing of elite GTVA pilots. However, these ships were from the Imperieuse battle group and should have been in Delta Serpentis...not engaging in an unsupported boarding operation within our space.

Our best theory at the moment concerns one of the prisoners the Dea Icaunis was transporting. Captain Esmar Al'Fadil of the 41st Bengals surrendered himself to UEF custody during a failed attack on the Jakarta Station dockyards. So far as we can tell, members of his squadron went rogue in order to rescue him from what they perceived as a fate worse than death.

According to forensics, the fighting aboard the UEC Dea Icaunis grew fierce, and the Tev marines deployed a thermobaric weapon after freeing their prisoners. There were no survivors. But don't blame yourself, Laporte...those Tev pilots were ruthless and experienced in a way even I can't understand. And you were outnumbered, at that.

Heal up. You're being shipped out in a week.

I'll miss you, Sub-Lieutenant."

8785, "I can barely remember getting hit. I don't know if I was afraid. Getting that close to death doesn't seem real. I wonder...why did they spare me?

(You may replay this mission to achieve a different ending. If you want to defeat the SOC wings, try the following strategy: swap your Vulcans for Mauls, hang back near your starting point to draw them out, and pick off one ship at a time using wingman commands.)"

8786, "Laporte, Vineto, Camerone, welcome back to the Solaris. We don't have a briefing room any more so we're going to do this over coffee. Cream, Sublieutenant?

I'm glad you all came home intact. The Tevs you ran into today were genuine badasses, some of them former SOC.

8839, "Good to see you, pilot. We were jumped by GTVA fighters during a navigational adjustment. They targeted both our weapons and engines. We're guessing they were planning to bring in marines and board us."

8840, "Are you carrying anything important, Icaunis? Information? N-space oscillators, maybe? The freighter Nauticus was hit by Gefs recently in a similar situation."

8841, "Nothing like that. Marines, some prisoners who surrendered during the Earth Sector blitz, a transfer crew, water and ammunition."

8842, "Well, they must have a transport nearby, waiting for their fighters to finish off your weapons...we need to get reinforcements here pronto. Let me signal the Solaris."

8843, "Solaris, this is Laporte. The Dea Icaunis is secured. She's been disabled and we suspect the Tevs have a marine team nearby standing by to board. Requesting reinforcements and a repair crew."

8845, "Captain Cull here. I don't like this, pilot. There's something off about this operation...too few fighters for a Tev strike."

8846, "Yeah, I'm getting the same feeling. The fighters attacking you weren't using normal Tev tactical comms...as if they wanted to stay off their own net..."

8847, "Looks like the marine transport you were expecting, pilot. Watch the escort. Fire Team Alpha, scramble to the ventral airlock and deploy claymores."

8848, "This is Commander Kai Chavel. We do not intend to engage your ships. Stand down and allow us to board peacefully. No one has to die here."

8849, "...that's a negative. This is a combat zone, and ROE holds. I cannot allow your ships near my charge."

8850, "You've got a choice here, pilot. You can stand aside and save a lot of lives, including your own. Or you can make things difficult. Think hard about your decision."

8851, "No."

8852, "If you have a diplomatic request, then go through diplomatic channels. But you don't get to make demands at gunpoint. And I cannot permit an unknown hostile with a dubious story to board this ship."

8853, "All right. So be it. If you're the one who killed Xinny and Zero, then I'm not going to have any regrets."

8854, "Beta wing is in! Hang on a little longer, Laporte! Pick your targets, open racks, and engage!"

8855, "Good to see you, Beta."

8856, "All right! Not an awful sendoff...we showed them, didn't we? Shot down their very best!"

8857, "Yeah, I guess..."

8858, "You sound cracked out of your mind, Laporte. Is this one of those famous combat highs of yours?"

8859, "Our marines are standing down. We still have no idea why those Tevs wanted to board us so badly. Mosaic, your engineers may begin repairs as soon as they're comfortably aboard."

8860, "Pilots, can you take escort on the Dea Icaunis? I'm going to head back to the Solaris. Clear my head, get some rest."

8861, "Sure, Laporte...what, getting tired of killing Tevs? We heard you were a real butcher out at Rheza."

8862, "I'm fine. Just...dangerously close to thinking about what I just did."

8863, "Captain! We did our best - we did our damn best -"

8864, "We're here for our Captain! Nothing more! We know what your Elders do to prisoners!"

Raids against Earth Sector continue, but for the most part, $f Second $f Fleet is under only limited strategic pressure. $f Fleet $f Admiral $f Netreba is in conference with $f Fleet $f Admiral $f Calder of the $f Jovian $f Rim $f Fleet survivors, and by all indications it looks like some major operation is about to commence.

I'll leave you under the care of your squadron leader. I believe you two have met.

8885, "For the attention of Sublieutenant Laporte,

Simms here. We've been introduced before. Welcome to the Indus.  I'm sorry I wasn't on deck to see you in. I read over your jacket. You're clearly a skilled pilot, if still a little green. I need that talent to rebuild this squadron.

I want to make it clear that things operate differently here in Two Fleet. The Martian military has a reputation for rowdiness and 'vivacious behavior'. This reputation is well-earned, but it doesn't mean you can be insubordinate without consequence. It's esprit de corps, not poor discipline, that keeps Two Fleet running.

There are only a few veteran pilots left on the Indus, so don't worry if we don't go crazy over the arrival of you and your fellow replacements. We're at the front lines. We've seen a lot of faces come and go. Don't expect a shiny badge or a badass squadron name$semicolon we're out here to do our jobs, not to fly air shows.

Welcome aboard.

Lorna Simms"

8886, "$b FLEETNET $b Personal - $b Flight $b Lieutenant $b Karen $b Ng'Mei

Hey Laporte. I just got word of your transfer to the Indus. You may remember me from the Nauticus incident. I'm de facto squadron leader aboard the Yangtze, since our CAG is a psychological casualty. Lorna Simms and I go way back.

Admiral Netreba is about to select forces for a big joint operation against the GTVA. Two months ago the Indus was the best frigate in Two Fleet, and Lorna Simms was a rising star. She got that job because five officers before her couldn't hack it.

But the last few weeks have really wrecked her. The Indus air wing has been running a 400% casualty rate. Simms and Flight Lieutenant Levi are about the only two left from the original squadron. Replacements show up and die almost daily.

Word has it that Lorna doesn't give her pilots callsigns any more, just numbers. The crew chief says that she's banned the flight deck from painting names on their ships. I think all the new pilots have turned into one long red blur for her. Worse, I think she prefers it that way. And all those rooks can tell. It's killing morale."

8887, "I want the Indus flying alongside the Yangtze if we do go for a big strike, and I want her pilots eager to follow their Captain. But Admiral Netreba will never choose a sick ship for his new task force.

Do me a favor. See if you can shake Simms up. I've attached a personality profile that might help you out - I hope you get a chance to review it.

Cordially yours,
Karen Ng'Mei"

8888, "$b Federation $b Pilot's $b Reference
$b Kentauroi $b Interceptor

Ultra-high performance interceptor and precision strike craft. Massively variable hull geometry. High afterburner velocity with good sustainability. Capable of reverse thrust.

Mounts Rapier cannon for anti-fighter attack and precision Paveway bombs on external racks for strikes against heavily defended targets at long range.

Survivability inside beam and flak envelopes is low.

Pilots transitioning to the Kentauroi from the Uhlan space superiority fighter are advised to practise with simulator modules and attain hands-on experience before combat.

Be advised that simulator modules have a known discrepancy with control layout in the latest Block 2 Kentaurois."

8889, "Yo. Laporte. Out of the bunk, into the hall, let's go, let's go!

I hear you and the other new transfers have been bitching about the lack of training sorties. I get that. I mean, if I didn't know this ship flew a couple dozen sorties a day off a slot deck, overworking a deck crew that gets four-hour sleep shifts and hasn't had a leave day in almost nine weeks, I'd be bitching for more flight time too. And I just assume you don't know all that.

Anyway, today's your lucky day, Laporte. I'm taking you out for some hands-on time with your Kentauroi. Get used to the cockpit, the new avionics, all that. Sound good?"

8890, "I already had the deck fit out your Kentauroi with weapons packages. We'll jump out, putter around, and come back. It'll give you a chance to get a feel for the interceptor and its weapons. The $g Yangtze is on Jump Five alert for this sector, so if anything goes wrong, expect $g Flight $g Lieutenant $g Ng'Mei and her wingman to come charging to the rescue, as usual.

I know you've had a couple discipline problems in the past. Your record says your last wing leader was your uncle, of all people. Consider this a chance to impress me with those Earthborn manners of yours, all right?

Let's go."

8893, "$b Retrieving $b Personal $b Communique
$b Sender: $b Karen $b Ng'Mei

Your goal is to jolt Captain Simms out of her guilt-fueled death spiral.

In my experience, Simms responds well to confidence and plain talk, but if you're too by-the-book she'll just ignore you. If you can demonstrate intelligence or experience, she'll listen. But failing that, she does some of her best thinking when angry. 

Just don't patronize or disrespect her or her abilities. And while she responds to honest emotion, don't get too empathic. She hates that. If you criticize her, criticize her professionally, not personally.

The worst thing you can do is convince her you're an idiot. She'll tolerate a surprising amount of insurbordination as long as it's going somewhere.

Once you've raised the topic, don't back down. "

8894, "Laporte! Get your skinny ass out of that cockpit, I'm debriefing in the locker room!

Yeah, okay. I'm not gonna close down our briefing closet for a two-pilot debrief. Lieutenant Levi's in there showing off his ACM footage anyway.

Get that zipper for me? ...thanks. Okay, we did good out there. Didn't lose anyone. Burnt some fuel, rattled some Tev raiders, good for morale. You can fly. I like that. Need good fliers for our next big op.

Look, uh. I appreciate the pointers about my command attitude. You're getting the hang of the Martian style, and what's more, you're probably right. I'm sick of making new friends and then losing them, but these new guys need a leader.

But keep in mind - rank matters, even in Two Fleet. One more outburst like that, whether Karen's behind it or not, and you'll be in the brig for insubordination. Granted, it'll only last ten minutes because I'll need you to fill out the roster, but...yeah, okay, you get it.

You like the Kentauroi? Hahah, yeah, thought so. That afterburner - wham! Beautiful kick.

Beta wing chased off an Aurora shadowing us. He must've traced our jump out and passed it to those Nyx. Steele puts the pressure on every damn inch of the Fleet, and we're not even his primary goal.

Right. Look. One more thing. I'm, uh, I'm pretty flattered by your attentions, but we've got to sort something out. Don't get me wrong, I'll tumble a pilot off another ship fast as the next woman, but in the same squadron, that's a no-go. So I'm afraid you're getting shot down at least once today, Laporte. No more schoolgirl flirt after missions.

Towel? Nice. Okay, Laporte, you keep all that shit straight, I'll get in real tight with the new pilots, we got ourselves a squadron and a ship. Nice doin' business."

8895, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

Sometimes, in the course of one's duty, a pilot receives orders that are hard to follow. But we execute them swiftly and efficiently, don't we? So I gave Captain Simms her towel."

8896, "Listen up, Laporte.

You pissed me off out there. You were insubordinate, presumptuous and downright stupid. I have no patience for this kind of behavior in a front-line combat unit.

Your shuttle back to First Fleet leaves at 0300 tomorrow. Pack your gear. Your transfer was a mistake."

8897, "Any of the four approaches can lead to success. If you can convince her you're worth listening (by discussing either her experience or yours), you simply need to identify the problem. If you make her angry, you're still in good shape - stand your ground when pressed and remind her of your own experience.

Don't resort to personal attacks and mockery or claims that you understand how she feels."

8898, "Good work out there, Laporte. You kept your cool and followed orders. That's better than most manage under fire.

I understand Flight Lieutenant Ng'Mei put you up to some kind of...psychological intervention. I appreciate that you didn't push it on me, because if you had, I would have you in the brig for insubordination in a heartbeat.

This ship and its pilots are both in dire need of rest and regeneration. The last thing we want is to get sucked into some kind of hare-brained strategic gamble...no matter how much Karen wants us along.

I'll see you around, Laporte."

8899, "Noemi Laporte was killed in combat with elements of the 60th Bloodletters, GTD Atreus.

The wolfpack pilots are talented, and they outnumber you two to one. Focus on evading their fire rather than maneuvering to attack them. If necessary, you can outrun the Nyxes until backup arrives.

Calling Simms for help will give you a temporary reprieve if you are in serious danger."

8900, "Lorna Simms was killed in combat with elements of the 60th Bloodletters, GTD Atreus.

Don't abandon your wing leader. Stay in the fight, and keep at least one of the Nyxes focused on you so Simms isn't overwhelmed. As long as you stay near a Nyx, she'll survive."

8918, "Understood, sir. With flight operations going at twelve thousand per minute, it'd be a pricey first date.  "

8920, "Sir!"

8921, "Sorry, sir. No sense building any rapport with a subordinate if she's not likely to live out the month, right?"

8923, "From what I've heard, Captain Simms, you're the one on the edge."

8924, "Don't even think you can untangle this for me, rook. The Indus takes hard assignments. We expect casualties."

8929, "What the hell do they do for discipline in First Fleet?  That's the most self-satisfied, smug psychobull I've heard since -"

8930, "Whoa, whoa, knock it off! Jump flash, tally bandits two by two, twelve klicks!"

8931, "Nyx. Gunship killers. An Aurora must have tracked our jump and vectored them in. We're in trouble."

8933, "Stay frosty, Two. It's going to take too long to recharge and get a nav fix, so I'm gonna call for backup. You've handled worse. "

8934, "One, last time I did this I was flying with wingmates I knew in a ship that fit like a glove!"

8968, "Lorna, I cannot quite tell if you're kidding or not, but I'm sure Laporte here appreciates the effort. That's two you owe me, Earther - one here, one for the Nauticus!"

8969, "I tried to pass your suggestion on, Flight Lieutenant Ng'Mei. Apparently Two Fleet isn't as informal as suggested."

8970, "Your suggestion...? Why don't you come to me directly next time you've got a problem with my command style, Flight Lieutenant Ng'Mei, instead of throwing sock puppets my way?"

8971, "The Indus needs to solve her own problems if she's going to be picked for this Big Op. I want you flying with us, Lorna. Besides...the Yangtze's got trouble enough of its own for me to handle."

8972, "...yeah. Well, I'll keep it in mind. Maybe show the newcomers a little love. With luck this batch will stick around longer than the last."

8973, "Great. Always happy to play go-between for the Second Fleet's alpha females. Captain Simms, if this WAS a first date, you've got poor choice of venue."

8974, "That better not turn into some kind of running joke, Laporte. Netreba cracks down on chain-of-command romances like a guerilla's hammer, and I'm on thin ice as it is with the casualty rate."

8975, "Romances? D'you hear this, Karen? Forbidden love is in the air!"

8976, "Great. My job security is in the hands of a First Fleet transfer, a notorious gossip, and the Federation's only spacefaring pig. Laporte, let's get back to the Indus before he builds up any more steam."

8987, "Word on the deck is that you're keeping the rooks at arm's length because you expect most of us to be dead inside the month."

8988, "Probably. The Indus takes the tough jobs. Do you want a hug?"

8989, "I don't need a thing from you, sir. But the other rooks are worried that you've already given up on them."

8990, "That's cute. And you? What do you think?"

8991, "I think that I transferred here to fly alongside the woman who saved my ass at Rheza. The one who called her people 'gods of war' and had more fighting spirit in her left nut than I found in all of First Fleet."

8992, "So far I'm disappointed. There's only one war god on the Indus, and she's as broken as the rest of us."

8993, "They weren't kidding about your discipline issues. Go on, Sublieutenant, tell me how you REALLY feel."

8994, "I outlived my whole squadron. I watched my gung-ho wingman drink himself into a sobbing ruin. Hell, I watched myself turn into a recreational killer."

8995, "I respect the chain of command if the chain of command respects me. I could be the best damn pilot you have...if you cut this 'sole survivor' bullshit and build a real squadron instead of a fodder factory."

8996, "Or, I could ship you back to First Fleet to guard depots. I need a good wingman, not a prima donna. So if you can't learn to keep your smug, self-satisfied psychobull -"

8997, "She's beautiful...not invincible, though. It's hard to believe how many pilots have died in these birds."

8998, "Trust me, Sublieutenant, it's best to keep your mind off the dead. Learn your ship, follow my orders, and get the job done. That's all that matters."

8999, "Sir, can I tell you something?"

9000, "Permission denied. Maintain brevity, let's wrap this sortie up."

9001, "I want to discuss the welfare of the squadron. I believe it directly impacts our mission performance."

9002, "...speak freely, Sublieutenant."

9003, "Sir, most of my squadron died during the Blitz. My friend Kassim went home a sobbing, drunken wreck. I've seen a lot of bad things happen to good people...not all of them on our side, either."

9004, "It's a messy war. But in case you hadn't been informed, Laporte, Two Fleet isn't quite as touchy-feely as Home Fleet."

9005, "My point is, SIR, that I transferred to the Indus because I admired you. I wanted to fight under someone who hadn't given up...someone who wasn't a fatalist."

9006, "So are you resigned to losing these rooks too? Or are you going to try giving a damn?"

9007, "What the hell kind of question is that? Does everyone in First Fleet act out like a spoiled society girl?"

9008, "Does every Captain in Second Fleet run her squadron like...like an assembly line for faceless cannon fodder? You don't even learn most of the new pilots' names!"

9009, "At Rheza you charged in with that 'gods of war' battle cry and I wanted to cheer right along with you. But now that I'm here, I find out that you're the only god left, and a pretty damn distant one at that."

9010, "Oh, give me a break. This isn't a dating service or a soap opera, Laporte, it's a military operation. So cut the smug, self-satisfied psychobabble -"

9012, "I like the ship. Marks a nice symbolic break from First Fleet, don't you think, sir?"

9013, "Heh, quite. Your transfer request made it quite specific that you had some problems with First Fleet. "

9014, "They were fighting to lose the war. They spent a lot of time and energy on remembering the fallen, and not nearly enough on killing Tevs."

9015, "You like killing Tevs? I'm impressed. Most Earthers are too deep in Ubuntu to get the job done right."

9016, "For better or worse, sir, I'm a killer. I transferred to the Indus because I wanted to serve a Captain who could use that. Someone I respected."

9017, "But now that I'm here, I'm concerned this squadron has its own special kind of bullshit to deal with. "

9018, "Your jacket was also quite specific about your discipline issues. Watch yourself, Sublieutenant. You're on thin ice."

9019, "You can hear me out, or you can ship me back to First Fleet. Your call."

9020, "I saw my last squadron bleed to death. Yours is worse - it's already dead. You don't have a squadron, sir, you have a factory for dead pilots."

9021, "It takes some balls to talk like this to your CO. I respect that. But if you don't get yourself under control, pilot, you'll be facing insubordination charges."

9022, "I'll deal. But you need to know, sir, that your attitude towards new pilots is impacting performance. If you expect them to die, then they expect to die, and then they die."

9023, "I remember your war cry from Rheza. You're not living up to it. You haven't convinced this squadron that they're gods of war, you've convinced them that they're doomed. Because you act like they're already dead."

9024, "I'm not sure that's much better than First Fleet. Sir. So why don't you cut the 'sole survivor' bullshit and build some rapport?"

9025, "Are you finished? Because that was the most high-handed, smug, self-satisfied piece of undermining I have ever heard, and -"

9026, "Thanks for taking me out, sir. Hands-on time is a rare privilege around here...am I doing something right?"

9027, "It's my job to make sure that new pilots don't go down to the first Tev schmuck that lines them up. This is not a personal favor.
"

9028, "So every rookie gets the CAG's undivided attention for an hour? Your professional standards don't leave much time for sleep."

9029, "If you don't button up, mess duty is going to have your undivided attention. Is discipline really this bad in First Fleet?"

9030, "I thought Second Fleet was the Federation's circus, sir. Did everyone sober up in time to ruin my fun?"

9031, "Great. I can tell when I'm wasting my time. You are a fucking disgrace, Laporte, and a disappointment at that. I -"

9032, "Sorry, sir. I was misled about Two Fleet discipline. It won't happen again."

9033, "It damn well better not. This is not a First Fleet massage parlor, Laporte, this is a combat unit."

9034, "Oh, First Fleet discipline is fine. There just wasn't anybody like you back there."

9035, "That's your problem, Sublieutenant, not mine. I don't want to hear about it again."

9036, "Understood, sir. I apologize for the presumption. I just thought my recommendation might have drawn your attention."

9037, "I'll grant you that. Captain Telfer of the Navajas had a great deal to say in your favor. I hope you can live up to his assessment."

9038, "Did he mention my command roles at the Nauticus incident and the Rheza perimeter? I think I'd make a good wing leader."

9039, "I appreciate confidence. I'll consider you. I may need a replacement for Levi in the near future...one way or another."

9040, "Captain Telfer is too favorable. My wing lost the Akula and the Ranvir and allowed the Meridian to slip away, and I botched a standoff at the Dea Icaunis."

9041, "I see. I appreciate your honesty, and I'll return it. There's no room for error in my squadron. This may not be the right place for you."

9042, "Given a strong commander and a lively squadron, I won't disappoint you, sir. I'm a killer. I transferred here so I could use that skill."

9043, "I...wish I could guarantee that, Laporte, but to be honest, things have been rough aboard the Indus of late."

9044, "Sir, you don't have to treat me like another disposable rookie. I know you expect bad casualties. I won't be one of them."

9045, "None of my rookies are disposable, Sublieutenant Laporte. Don't bother requesting special treatment, because all you'll do is piss me off."

9046, "Can you really keep your mind off the dead, sir? The way you treat the rooks...you act like they're already gone."

9047, "I don't recall giving you permission to speak freely, Laporte. Maintain brevity."

9048, "Sir, this issue is relevant to the performance of the squadron. We're all trusting you with our lives. We need to know you haven't already given up on us."

9049, "Maybe you missed the briefing, Laporte, but Two Fleet isn't quite as touchy-feely as your old home. So stow that shit."

9050, "Copy that."

9051, "I'm asking for advice, sir. How do I handle losing a squadmate? If I were you, I imagine I'd be a wreck."

9052, "Then you shouldn't be a combat pilot. If you can't handle death, I don't know how you made it this far."

9053, "I concur, sir. As far as I can tell, this squadron handles its losses the right way. I have no complaints. "

9054, "I'm terribly grateful to have your approval, Laporte. Watch your spacing."

9055, "You sound like you've been at this a long time, Captain. I suppose you live up to that 'gods of war' battle cry you favor."

9056, "It's an old Martian tradition. Boosts morale. Good morale puts pilots into the flow state, and that saves lives. I'm glad you appreciate it."

9057, "You must have been close to the squadron after so long together. How bad have things been?"

9058, "You know what, I don't recall signing up for a goddamn therapy session. Do you understand the meaning of 'chain of command'?"

9059, "You know, sir, when you turned up at Rheza..that was something else. You saved a lot of lives that day, including mine. Do you make a habit of it?"

9060, "That's why we do the job, Laporte. Look, we call ourselves gods of war, but that implies responsibility as well as bloodshed. You kill to save."

9061, "Flight Lieutenant Ng'Mei off the Yangtze mentioned you, sir. Have you served together? "

9062, "My first combat posting was on the Yangtze, before the war broke out. Karen Ng'Mei was a sublieutenant there...she's been passing up promotions to stay there since. She sort of cultivates pilots. Might pick you out if you're lucky."

9063, "Sir, while we're out here, I want to discuss some scuttlebutt that's been going around the deck. I think I speak for the rest of the new transfers when I say I have some concerns."

9064, "I respect and value candor, Sublieutenant, but you are walking a very fine line here. This sortie is not a break from military protocol."

9065, "We all know that rooks don't last long on the Indus, sir. Word on the deck is that you're keeping the rooks at arm's length because you expect most of us to be dead inside the month."

9066, "You will probably all be dead within the month, no matter what I or anyone else might do for you. I won't lie to you about that. Do you want a hug?"

9067, "No, sir, I understand the statistics. I suppose it's just something we'll have to try not to think about. "

9068, "I don't need a damn thing from you, sir. But you are our leader. If you don't make an effort to help these people, you might as well just shoot them yourself."

9069, "Fuck you, Laporte, you sanctimonious piece of shit. You don't get to walk in to my squadron and mouth off to a superior officer."

9070, "'No matter what?' That sounds like a piss-poor excuse for a failed commander's guilt. Get over yourself, Simms. People are counting on you."

9071, "...you just crossed the line, pilot. You're going back to First Fleet in irons. This is a military, not a soap opera."

9072, "You know, sir, I transferred here to fly alongside the woman who saved my ass at Rheza. The one who called her people 'gods of war' and had more fighting spirit in her left nut than I found in all of First Fleet. Did I end up on the right ship?"

9073, "Captain Sorensen writes my evaluations, not wetnosed First Fleet society girls. Are you going somewhere with this?"

9074, "I outlived my whole squadron. I watched my gung-ho wingman drink himself into a sobbing ruin while I turned into a recreational killer. Believe me, Simms, I have an eye for people on the edge."

9075, " respect what I saw in your jacket. You're on very thin ice, Laporte, but I'm going to listen a little longer."

9076, "Or, I could ship you back to First Fleet to guard depots. I need a good wingman, not a prima donna spouting smug, self-satisfied psychobullshit."

9077, "I'm just trying to tell you, sir, that I think you're a gifted commander with a lot of experience. You could make these rooks into fierce, disciplined warriors. I'm eager to learn."

9078, "...was that a joke? Did you actually speak those words with a straight face? Are you aware that you're in a military unit, not some kind of summer camp?"

9079, "Sir, it's no secret this war's going against us. We're bleeding pilots faster than we can train new ones - I saw that firsthand. And the Tevs are building up their pilot corps as fast as ours is disintegrating."

9080, "Thanks for the strategic update, Laporte, that was so much better than the one I get every day from the Admiralty."

9081, "You're one of the only experienced pilots we have left, sir, and we have a few weeks of breathing room ahead of us. What can you get done in that time? You have a lot of raw material in these rooks."

9082, "You know, Laporte, I want to rip you a new one for insubordination...but with all the fighting lately I've neglected this kind of planning. I like how you think."

9083, "If I were in your shoes I'd be about ready to give up. But we just need to hold the line, sir. Get these pilots into fighting shape and give the Elders time to work on a way to win the war. Ubuntu will find a way."

9084, "Wow. That's really adorable. Not only do you think the Elders have any fucking idea how to win a war, you think we just need to do our jobs and it'll all be okay. What a piece of work."

9085, "I think we all know we're fucked. But I want to ask you, sir, in the spirit of your battle cry, or the Indus's stand at Rheza...are we really going to go out lying down? Because thats how this squadron feels."

9086, "That's your big concern? The squadron feels sad? I have a 400% casualty rate out here, Laporte, and nobody feels good about that. Do you think I hand-picked the mood?"

9087, "Your transfer request made it quite specific that you had some problems with First Fleet. Is Second Fleet living up to your expectations, Sublieutenant?"

9088, "Most Earthers are too deep in Ubuntu to get the job done right. In Two Fleet we honor the fallen by doing our jobs and earning some payback."

9089, "I concur, sir. The best way to honor the fallen is by carrying out our duties with unflagging diligence. And I do mean that earnestly, as trite as it sounds. It's not an easy task with so many gone."

9090, "No...no it's not. I'm sensing some veiled criticism here, Laporte."

9091, "The most exasperating thing about First Fleet was that damn 'strategic deterrence posture.' It just seemed to mean total paralysis."

9092, "You're going to see a lot of hostility towards Earth and Byrne because of that policy. It's as if they cut the rest of the Federation loose."

9093, "Sir, it's my understanding the Indus has lost most of its pilots in the past few weeks. How has that impacted morale?"

9094, "What the hell kind of question is that, Sublieutenant? Do you even need to ask? Couldn't you tell the moment you stepped off the shuttle?"

9095, "I have high hopes for my time in Second Fleet, sir. If all goes well I'm hoping to hit back against the Tevs. Maybe make a real difference in this war."

9096, "Don't get your hopes up, Sublieutenant, I've heard those same words from a lot of lips."

9097, "I heard that kind of fatalistic talk in First Fleet, sir, but I didn't expect it from you. Have conditions changed aboard the Indus since you intervened at Rheza?"

9098, "We've lost a lot of pilots over the last few weeks. It's not a topic appropriate for this sortie. Focus on your instruments, pilot."

9099, "I think this group of rooks is special, sir. Consider it a fresh start. If we come together as a squadron I expect we'll give the Tevs something to think about."

9100, "I have no doubt you're correct, Sublieutenant, the Tevs will certainly give our squadron some thought...of one sort or another. Piece of advice? Don't think too far ahead."

9101, "We have a good history together, Simms. We both saw the Meridian attack...it only took a few squadrons and a single frigate team to pull that off. We saved Rheza. We can do that again."

9102, "...those are some of the better memories of the past few weeks, Laporte. I appreciate that. It's easy to lose sight of those victories"

9103, "Sir, I'll be honest. I wasn't a good fit for First Fleet. They still haven't sorted out the institutional contradiction between the military and Ubuntu philosophy. They want to be thoughtful, apologetic killers."

9104, "We don't waste time on apologies here, I can guarantee you that. The cliches about hotblooded Martians are true. This is our world and we're not giving it up to a league of upstart colonials."

9105, "I'm angry at the Tevs. I think they're arrogant and misguided, and I resent their claims to the moral high ground in an unprovoked, unilateral conflict. I want to punish their crimes."

9106, "I've got my own list of grievances against them...but I can't guarantee you we'll ever be able to deliver, pilot. This war is not a personal feud."

9107, "Sir, if you don't waste time on apologies, why are you so clearly wrapped up in guilt over the deaths of your pilots? If you'll pardon the presumption, sir."

9108, "You've got a lot of fucking nerve, Laporte. I read all about your discipline issues, and apparently they weren't exaggerated."

9109, "I heard all those cliches, sir, but the squadron seems strangely subdued for one of Two Fleet's infamous fighter kennels. I'm guessing the casualty rate has taken its toll."

9110, "It's pretty ballsy of you to bring it right up like that, Laporte...but you're both perceptive and correct. The chemistry died with most of the old pilots."

9111, "You're sharper than I expected. You don't have to beat around the bush. Give me your thoughts on my command performance, Laporte, you've clearly got some."

9112, "Sir, I left First Fleet to escape pervasive combat shock. But your attitudes towards these new pilots is giving me deja vu."

9113, "Sir, after some thought, I'm not comfortable with the breach of protocol this conversation implies."

9114, "Don't be timid about the issue. Give it to me straight."

9115, "My views on the problem are immaterial. It should be handled by command review through an appropriate authority. "

9116, "That's an easy attitude for you to take, Sublieutenant. Maybe you don't understand what it's been like out here these past few weeks. This is not the Solaris, safest ship in the fleet. We are right on the bloody edge here."

9117, "You're right, sir, I haven't been here. I can only speak to my current observations."

9118, "Sir, if you want to do something about that 400% casualty rate, stop treating the rookies like they're already dead. Make it clear that they're your people now."

9119, "Think very carefully about your next words, Sublieutenant, because you are in serious danger of coming up on charges. I do not have time or patience for this kind of idiocy."

9120, "Look, I'll be straight with you. I saw my last squadron bleed to death. Yours is worse - it's already dead. You don't have a squadron, sir, you have a factory for lost pilots."

9121, "I apologize, sir. I'll submit myself to review as soon as we return to the Indus. I'm accustomed to loose command discipline."

9122, "You're just determined to piss me off, aren't you, Laporte? You've put your foot in it, so follow through. Do you think I'm unfit to command this squadron?"

9123, "The fact that you're even asking me that question suggests you need to take some time to sort yourself out, sir. If you can't lead, then step aside."

9124, " I think that 400% casualty rate cut you so deep that you just gave up. You're afraid of what will happen if you let yourself get close again."

9125, "Who the hell do you think you are? I mean, listen to yourself, you smug, high-handed, condescending -"

9126, "Look, Simms, if you want to keep acting like these rooks are already dead, then that's going to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Your call."

9127, "You know what, maybe you should be asking yourself that question. Who the hell are YOU to treat your rookies this way? What kind of commander does that make you?"

9128, "Don't even pretend to understand what's happened on this ship, Laporte. While you were salvaging waylaid freighters we were turning the butcher's bill into a goddamn chapter book out here."

9129, "Wake up, Simms! You know what happened to the Navajas! You're not the only soldier in the universe who's seen her squadron die a hundred little deaths!"

9130, "You are guilty of negligence, Simms, and the cold fact is that negligence is causing the deaths of your pilots. You don't want to care about them dying, so you let them die!"

9131, "All right, pilot, let's wrap this sortie up. Get a feel for the ship, and let me know if you have any special requests."

9132, "Sir, I have serious concerns about morale aboard the Indus. The other rookies believe you're holding them at arm's length because you expect them all to die."

9133, "Copy that, One."

9134, "Laporte, in case it somehow wasn't clear, this is a military unit, and you will behave like a flight officer. You are not in charge of rookie morale."

9135, "Copy that, sir. Buttoning up."

9136, "This is urgent, sir. If you don't seriously reconsider your attitude towards the new pilots, you're going to push the Indus's casualty rate up towards five hundred percent."

9137, "You know what? You're really pissing me off, Laporte. You act like discipline is just a set of guidelines. You lecture me about command attitude. Did your uncle treat you like some kind of princess? Is that the problem?"

9138, "Look, sir, if I were in your position, I don't think I'd act any differently. Your friends and comrades are dead. You're fundamentally alone out here. And you can't let yourself get close for fear of losing us too."

9139, "You know what pisses me off, sir? Waste. You've lost so many pilots that the only way you think you can survive is by detaching yourself. Well, we can all tell you're resigned to our deaths. And that kills people."

9140, "Oh, for fuck's sake, Sublieutenant. Go on. Tell me how you REALLY feel."

9141, "You have to do better, or these rooks will all die! You may have convinced yourself that there's nothing you can do, but that's simple dereliction of duty!"

9142, "What I've seen and heard this sortie has been a major disappointment, pilot. Your jacket and your previous conduct led me to expect better."

9143, "Sir! I'll try to comport myself more in line with your expectations."

9144, "You know what, sir, I could say the same about you. I came here to serve under an officer who could use my skills...not one hamstrung by self-pity."

9145, "Is this a joke? Do you think you can get away with that kind of insubordination?"

9146, "Any good command is built on trust, sir, and I don't trust you. None of the rooks do. You're too wrapped up in your own dead."

9147, "Get mad, Simms. Go volcanic. Anything's better than this detachment you've maintained."

9148, "You're a farce, Laporte. You're a testament to everything wrong with First Fleet. Military discipline is not some kind of optional accessory."

9149, "Military discipline exists to keep a unit functioning! And this unit, sir, does not function! This is a factory for cannon fodder!"

9150, "You know what's a farce, Simms? Your squadron. You are a satire of a commander, a paper tiger with all the leadership qualities of a voodoo omen. "

9151, "You are WAY out of line, Sublieutenant. This is your last chance to back down, or you're going to get real familiar with the brig."

9152, "I'm just trying to tell you what's wrong, sir. Because as things stand, this isn't a squadron that deserves my service."

9153, "Fine. So be it. What I'm saying has to be said, even if ends my career. Because your attitude towards these rookies is getting them killed."

9185, "Furthermore, Karen, my ship is a charnel house. I don't want my pilots anywhere near a big op until I can stop the bleeding. Stop trying to pull me into something I'm not ready for."

9186, "Understood, sir. The Indus and the Yangtze have always flown together, but I'm sure Admiral Netreba can find another frigate team for the job. I hear the Ridwan and Hebrides are performing well."

9187, "Fine. So long as I don't have to listen to any more of these cubs screaming into the comm while they burn to death, I'm happy. I'll see you 'round, Karen."

9188, "I'm sorry I got you into this mess, Laporte. Watch the beams."

9189, "Well, Karen, I'm afraid you picked the wrong agent. If Laporte was supposed to trigger some profound epiphany, she did a damn poor job of it. Perfectly competent pilot, but no PsyOps expert."

9190, "Well done, Laporte. Simms is a thorny target, but you got through. It's about time she stopped wallowing in her own guilt."

9191, "Karen 'ere will make sure Netreba hears of this. She's got all sorts of funny connections. Fly well, Laporte."

9195, "The Plunder"

9196, "The GTL Agincourt has been found, and a task force, codenamed Wargods, is sent out to capture her intact"

9197, "To the officers and crew of the UEFg Indus,

At 0750 today $f Admiral $f Netreba passed a coded directive to elements of $f Second $f Fleet. In a break from Byrne's doctrine of defensive war, $f Calder and $f Netreba have finalized their plans for the creation of an elite strategic unit. The objective of this task force will be to undertake risky offensive operations against the $h GTVA war machine. The Admirals hope to derail $h Admiral $h Steele's plan for a crushing attack on Earth by year's end.

The $f Altan $f Orde and $f Katana, two surviving frigates of Calder's Third Fleet, will join this task force. From Second Fleet, Netreba has selected the $f Yangtze ... and the $f Indus. 

I am proud of each and every one of you. Our ship has earned this honor, and she will continue to do so with every mission she and her pilots complete. Hope lives on. 

I will provide details of our first mission, the oft-rumored 'Big Op', in the days to come. For now, stand to your duties with the utmost vigilance.

Captain Lloyd Sorenson"

9198, "For the attention of Sublieutenant Laporte,

Hey, Laporte. Maybe you should pick better war cries to make fun of. Apparently the Yangtze pilots are calling our task force the 'Wargods', after a certain Indus captain's morale-boosting battle shout par excellence.

I'll bet you a Jump Five shift that it's going to catch on.

Captain Lorna Simms"

9199, "$b Second $b Fleet $b Strategic $b Update
$b Cleared $b for $b Limited $b Dissemination

From the Admiral's Desk

To the officers of Second Fleet Mars, this is a monthly high-level update.

The strategic situation is this. The $h GTD $h Imperieuse has withdrawn to Delta Serpentis to replenish its squadrons after spearheading the Blitz against Earth.

This leaves the $h GTD $h Atreus, the $h GTD $h Carthage, and the $h GTD $h Hood in-system conducting flight operations. In spite of his public statements, Steele is currently building up assets for his planned coup de main. 

In order to prevent our three Fleets from striking, he has deployed the GTD Hood's squadrons to conduct constant raids against military targets in Earth Sector. The pressure is intense and First Fleet refuses to give up any assets for non-defensive operations."

9200, "Steele has also launched a series of aggressive attacks against Second and Third Fleet assets in Mars sector. In the past few days, we have lost two training squadrons and six supply depots, including forty-eight uncrewed Izra'il assault fighters awaiting deployment. We cannot regain any strategic momentum under these conditions.

Unlike the attacks on Earth, we are unable to determine the origin of these raids. Subspace vectoring is inconclusive and we have yet to detect a consistent origin point.

Operations are under way to counter this threat and put us back on the attack. In spite of the stance of our honored Elders and Admiral Byrne, Calder and I have concluded that some offensive operations are necessary to prevent our total defeat.

Thank you all for your loyalty and steadfast devotion. We will persevere.

Admiral Netreba
UED Eris
Second Fleet Mars"

9201, "Eyes and ears, people. We've finally received the go-ahead for the Big Op. We're going to strike a major blow at the $h GTVA.

Our strategic objective is to gain the Second and Third Fleets a respite from constant raids so they can hit back and take some pressure off $f Earth.

Our tactical objective is the capture and retrieval of the $r Agincourt, an $r Anemoi class logistics vessel. There are only two of these ships in-system. Designed as mobile resupply platforms capable of field-repairing a destroyer or servicing an entire battle group for months, these ships are packed with sophisticated technology - and therefore incredibly valuable."

9202, "Agincourt"

9203, "The $r Agincourt is the key to the constant, unpredictable $r Tev raids on Mars. Instead of jumping back to Jupiter to rearm and refuel, $r GTVA strike craft and warships rendezvous with the $r Agincourt as it jumps around the system, moving above and below the plane of the ecliptic. The $r Agincourt tops ships off with fresh armor, subsystem repairs, and ordinance, then sends them back in.

Now, as those of you who got through Tactical know, the $r Agincourt is just as close as Jupiter - five minutes away by subspace. The advantage to a mobile rally point is that we can't easily predict the source of the raids and track them to their target via subspace vectoring. This is how they keep blindsiding us. We can't tell when they're coming, and we can't hit back.

That ends now."

9204, "Siren"

9205, "The $r Agincourt travels under total comms silence, escorted by the cruisers $r Elissa and $r Utica and the corvette $r Siren. All of these ships are front-line combatants armed with pulse weapons and multiple AAA beams. They're supplemented by a well-rested, well-supplied fighter squadron.

We have obtained the $r Agincourt's jump schedule from a source inside the $h GTVA. In three hours, the $f Altan $f Orde and $f Katana will raid Tev assets around Jupiter, drawing off their forces and attention.

Our strike package inserts ten minutes later. The $f Yangtze and $f Indus will jump to the $f Agincourt as it completes a scheduled hop, blanket the area in jamming so it can't send a distress signal, and neutralize the escort. We will provide fighter cover and precision strike support for the frigates."

9206, "Once the escort has been neutralized, we will disable the $h Agincourt, then sortie the $f Gloire with an elite CQB/HVBO assault team aboard. This team will capture the $h Agincourt, killing the crew if necessary. We will have ten minutes to carry this out before the $h Agincourt recharges her drive, plots a fix for $h Artemis $h Station, and jumps out. Additionally, if either the $f Indus or $f Yangtze is lost, our jamming will be compromised, and we will immediately abort.

We will then extract the captured $r Agincourt and all its supplies directly to Earth. If the drives are too badly damaged for a field repair, we will move the ship out via a nearby intrasystem gate about a week's travel away. As long as we get the logistics ship clear of the engagement area quickly, the Tevs should have trouble locating it if we're running dark."

9207, "119th Immortals"

9208, "Wargods Strike Package"

9209, "We will fly alongside our fellow $f Yangtze Wargods. $f Alpha wing, under me, will fly Kentauroi interceptors. Laporte, you'll take my wing. $f Beta wing, off the $f Yangtze and under Flight Lieutenant Ng'Mei, will also fly Kents. We'll handle beam disarmament and the destruction of the $h GTVA escort. I strongly suggest that some of you pack Paveway bombs and Scalpel disruptors.

$f Gamma wing will pilot gunships and perform heavy suppression and torpedo attacks on the cruisers.

One more thing. We are jamming transmissions out of this area, but if the Tevs see a huge amount of subspace traffic towards the $h Agincourt - and one of their wandering Auroras may vector us - then we'll be tumbled. So no reinforcements, no frigates jumping in to back us up. We do this alone. "

9210, "Gamma"

9211, "Beta"

9212, "Right, Wargods. We are an experiment without much political support amongst the Elders or First Fleet. If we prove our worth here, that's the first step towards bigger things...maybe even victory.

Let's go prove that there's still some hope for our Federation."

9213, "We lost the Indus. Captain Sorenson, everyone I knew...it was a blood-soaked ship, maybe, but she didn't deserve to go out like this.

We made our best shot at the Agincourt, but the Tevs were ready, and the operation failed. We're not going to get a chance like that again. Admiral Netreba is disbanding the Wargods and returning us to front-line duty. We may never go on the offensive again during the remainder of the war.

With the Indus gone, I'm transferring to Third Fleet, where I am going to kill Tevs until they kill me. How and where the rest of you sorry lot die is up to Netreba.

For a few days I thought the Wargods were going to be something special, pilots, but it looks like my faith was misplaced."

9214, "Destroying Tev beam cannons with your Paveways may help the frigates survive.

You can always press Alt-G to call for Simms' help. This will make you temporarily resistant to damage as Simms' fighter passes you tactical information and ECM support."

9215, "We lost the Yangtze. Captain Kyrematen and her entire crew are dead. Captain Sorenson is taking it hard. He hasn't come out of his quarters since the attack. As for Flight Lieutenant Karen Ng'Mei, well...she was a mother figure to a lot of us, but she's cracked.

We made our best shot at the Agincourt, but the Tevs were ready, and the operation failed. We're not going to get a chance like that again. Admiral Netreba is disbanding the Wargods and returning us to front-line duty. We may never go on the offensive again during the remainder of the war.

With the Yangtze gone, and the Indus moved to patrol and Jump Five duty for the rest of its career, I'm transferring to Third Fleet, where I am going to kill Tevs until they kill me. How and where the rest of you sorry lot die is up to Netreba.

For a few days I thought the Wargods were going to be something special, pilots, but it looks like my faith was misplaced."

9216, "We lost the Gloire and its entire marine detachment. That was the best CQB/HVBO team in Two Fleet, and we wasted their lives. We should've covered that cruiser better.

We made our best shot at the Agincourt, but the Tevs were ready, and the operation failed. We're not going to get a chance like that again. Admiral Netreba is disbanding the Wargods and returning us to front-line duty. We may never go on the offensive again during the remainder of the war.

With the Indus moved to patrol and Jump Five duty for the rest of its career, I'm transferring to Third Fleet, where I am going to kill Tevs until they kill me. How and where the rest of you sorry lot die is up to Netreba.

For a few days I thought the Wargods were going to be something special, pilots, but it looks like my faith was misplaced."

9217, "Try to get to the Tev bombers early in order to preserve the Gloire. Order Gamma Wing to attack the bombers in order to provide Slammer suppression."

9218, "All right, Wargods, take a seat!

I have some bad news. We're out of the war for six days. Due to engine damage sustained during the assault, we're moving the Agincourt to a nearby intrasystem gate via fusion drive. Because we can't give away our position to the Tevs, there will be no subspace traffic in or out of our position: that means no reinforcements, no jumps home, and absolute comms silence.

The GTVA is hunting for the Agincourt. We've detected Aurora scouts making hops throughout the area. Fortunately, it appears we've moved the Agincourt far enough from its scheduled coordinates that the Tevs are having trouble finding it - space is huge and very empty. Better yet, Admiral Calder has deployed three escorted ECM decoy ships to further confuse matters.

Now for the good news. That was an excellent mission, Wargods. We successfully coordinated gunship fire, interception, and precision strikes, and achieved a difficult and strategically critical objective. I'm very proud of every one of you.

The Indus and Yangtze took damage during the assault. They'll be escorting the Agincourt out, performing active-armor repairs via polymer injection and doing systems and turret run-ups.

The Agincourt is fully under the control of our marines, and I've convinced a contact to 'liberate' some of the Agincourt's stocks for us. We'll have fresh water, mattresses instead of pallets, and a lot of entertainment during the next few quiet days. I'll draw up a patrol schedule, but my goal is to get all of you rested and ready for what's to come."

9219, "Sublieutenant! Laporte, over here!

Good to see you still in one piece. Look, Lieutenant Levi and I were thinking - we have all this stuff off the Agincourt to work with, and they're spinning down the grav deck for repairs tomorrow.

I think we need to hold a little camaraderie-building session for the squadron."

9220, "That was a blunder of cosmic proportions. Truly execrable flying.

Our failure to prevent the Tevs from slipping away was unforgivable. We had the Tev escort beat, but we let that cow of a ship compromise our mission.

We made our best shot at the Agincourt, but you borked it up, and the operation failed. We're not going to get a chance like that again. Admiral Netreba is disbanding the Wargods and returning us to front-line duty. We may never go on the offensive again during the remainder of the war.

With the Indus moved to patrol and Jump Five duty for the rest of its career, I'm transferring to Third Fleet, where I am going to kill Tevs until they kill me. How and where the rest of you sorry lot die is up to Netreba.

9263, "Choon me this, now: when in the last fifty years did the human race start building Orion-sized freighters?"

9270, "Wargods, the Siren is closing in. Those spinal beams have Captain Sorensen worried. Do the old man a favor."

9271, "Way ahead of you, Indus Tac. Hey, hey, watch the flak pocket between those cruisers, everyone! You might skin your knees, and Principal Simms is all out of iodine!"

9273, "Shut up and shoot, Laporte!"

9280, "Taurus wing splashed. Four less Nyx to worry about."

9281, "Libra wing down. That should disrupt the Tev battlenet."

9282, "Well done, pilots, the Siren is defanged. Proceeding with planned engagement."

9283, "And...that's it for the escort! Bravo zulu, Wargods, we just cleaned house with a front-line tactical unit."

9284, "Should we take a moment to pay our respects to the enemy dead? What do you think, pilots?"

9285, "I think we've spent plenty of time respecting them already, Yangtze."

9286, "Yeah, we've really been engaging in some intense communication with them. I had a profound dialogue with one, I really did."

9287, "Put some rounds into the Agincourt's engine manifolds, pilots. If that ship jumps, we've wasted our chance."

9288, "<intercepted> Agincourt, Siren. Situation degrading. Get a pod or a fighter clear ASAP. We'll hold as long as we can."

9289, "Siren corvette destroyed.  May her crew find peace."

9290, "Damn, did you see that? That was a very pretty boom."

9291, "All right, I think we've pounded the Agincourt enough. Gunnery, mark the Agincourt as a no-shoot target until you receive a countermand. Copy to Yangtze Tactical, please."

9292, "GTL Agincourt, your escorts have been destroyed and your engines are in failsafe shutdown. Stand down, or we'll open you to space."

9293, "This is Captain Sibrine. In order to preserve the lives of my crew, and in accordance with General Order Eighteen, I hereby surrender my vessel to the custody of the United Earth Federation."

9294, "Agincourt, I'm reading activity in your logistics bays. Be warned that if you make any attempt to destroy your own supplies or equipment, our marines will kill you and your crew."

9295, "And we really don't want to do that, Captain Sibrine. War crimes really perturb my inner calm, you know what I mean? This is serious Zen shit you're endangering here."

9296, "Very well. For the record, I want it known that my decision to abandon cargo-destruction protocols was made in order to preserve my crew."

9297, "Now that's some real dedication there, Sibrine. Don't worry, you cuiter, you'll be able to spend the rest of the war 'preserving' your crew in a Solis Lacus camp."

9298, "We're signaling the Gloire with precise coordinates. Marines will be on station in less than a minute."

9299, "This is the Gloire. We're now moving to breach the Agincourt. Fire teams Alpha and Bravo, stand by to make entry. Check your armor, everyone."

9300, "Be careful, Gloire. Remember what happened to the Juniper during the Kubara boarding. Keep your security partitions ready in case someone tosses a pocket nuke in."

9301, "No need to mother-hen us, Captain Kyrematen. We've got it. Alpha, Bravo, ROE is weapons tight. Any negligent discharge with that 15 mil and you could hole something critical."

9302, "Good job handling that snag, Wargods. We're in position. Agincourt airlock is handshaking and opening. Cobra drones, go...in and clear, thermal clear, GTDS clear...okay, entrance is clear. Go go go."

9303, "-eft clear! Alpha Six, we're in, following the Cobras. Check your corners, people! Watch that companionway, Sev!"

9304, "Bravo Six moving towards the CIC. No sign of resistance. Check and move, people! I want Cobras under that hatch and a wall flood on the compartment!"

9305, "Gloire, Alpha Six. We have the Agincourt's Marine detachment in peaceful custody. We've secured their magazines and the armory, including some intact Komodo suits."

9306, "All right, Marines, we're putting the capture team aboard. Secure CIC, damage control, nav, and engineering."

9307, "Registering meson reactor containment failure aboard the Elissa. Scratch one Hyperion."

9308, "Catastrophic hull failure in progress aboard the Utica. Scratch target."

9309, "The Agincourt has been destroyed! How the hell did we manage that, people? Let's get out of here before more Tevs arrive!"

9310, "Simms, I'm in trouble here!"

9311, "Copy that, Laporte. Hold it together a little longer, rook, and I'll see what I can do."

9312, "I got you, Two. Stay defensive, break if you get spiked, and keep a thumb on the CM ejector toggle."

9313, "You're a regular duckling, Laporte. Stand by, I'm inbound."

9314, "Damsel in distress! I'm inbound, stand by."

9315, "Whoa, uh-oh. Uh, Simms, I'm in trouble here!"

9316, "Simms, the Tevs are giving me some real grief."

9317, "One, Two. I'm in a tight spot. Could use some cover here!"

9318, "Oy, bugger me! We've got an arseload of bombers jumping in! Think our op's been tumbled?"

9319, "No, they're just dropping back in from a raid, hoping to top off fuel and bombs at the Agincourt. Splash 'em quick, wargods."

9320, "Keep your PDS at the ready, Gloire. There's a lot of them and we're liable to let a few leak."

9321, "We lost the Gloire and the boarding party! Op's a wash, people. Let's get our people off the Agincourt, blow the ship, and get out."

9322, "Tev fire has saturated our point defenses and passed our safe armor threshold. We're on the red-line now pilots."

9323, "So much for the bombers. Almost feel sorry for the poor bastards, don't you? A third the training their fighter pilots get, glorified warhead buses to fly without even a turret to give 'em cover, and half the time their escorts get pulled."

9324, "If their bombers are such pilot-killers, why do they keep the stupid things around? "

9325, "Operational surplus, I guess. Just like the Myrmidon. The fact is that for every unescorted flight we catch like that, three more get through to blitz some unguarded station or harry a warship."

9326, "Ay, Indus. Did those pilots get a transmission off?"

9327, "The Boanerges strike transmitted six distress calls, but they couldn't overpower our jamming."

9328, "Jump flash! I've got two GTVA wings, a cruiser, and an AWACS inbound! They must be here to resupply!"

9329, "Pilots, scramble to destroy that AWACS! She's isolating our jamming frequencies and in less than four minutes she'll broadcast our position straight to Admiral Steele!"

9330, "Play it safe, people. Watch the Aeolus, and remember, no survivors. If anyone jumps home, we're racked."

9331, "Pilots, the Panopticon just punched a transmission through our jamming. Recon reports that the Atreus and a hunter-killer corvette group are coming down on us. We need to get out, now."

9332, "The AWACS is offline and breaking apart. Operational security preserved. Mop up any remaining fighters - if you keep them in ACM they're not likely to risk jumping."

9333, "Good work, everyone. That was well handled, and those Tevs gave us a good fight. I'm officially proud of you all."

9334, "We've got some bad news, pilots. The Agincourt's subspace drive was either damaged during the attack or sabotaged during the boarding. Without a new motivator, this ship is going nowhere."

9335, "Request mission update, Indus. If we can't jump the Agincourt out by its next scheduled check-in, we're going to be overwhelmed by Tev reinforcements."

9336, "Negative, pilots. We have a contingency for this event. There's a local gate to Mars less than six days' sublight travel from here. We'll conduct repairs with onboard supplies and bring the Agincourt out on fusion drives."

9337, "Eish, six days without Jump Fives or raids? Did we finally stumble on the secret formula to earn some leave in Two Fleet?"

9338, "That's exactly right, Olefumi. They give you a week for every logistics ship you bring in and a bonus week for the Atreus. Hit the deck, pilots! I won't rest easy until we've got this sucker locked down in Mars orbit, so let's get moving!"

9339, "Acknowledged. Standing by for Indus autoland handshake."

9340, "The Agincourt is preparing to jump. Destroy that engine subsystem, pilots, or our target is going to slip away."

9341, "What do you think, Captain Simms? We're doing all right so far. I think we might just pull this off."

9342, "How very earnest of you, Laporte...but yeah, assuming a hunter-killer group doesn't pop in to rearm and rearmor, this might not be a bloodbath. And that's as optimistic as I'll get, so don't push it!"

9343, "Come on, wargods, splash that AWACS! We didn't come this far just to get tumbled now!"

9344, "We're reading a subspace exit. The mission is compromised. What the hell happened, people? Let's get out of here before hunter-killers arrive - we have some explaining to do!"

9345, "Indus control, the Agincourt is ours. Repeat, we have control of the Agincourt."

9346, "Someone on the Agincourt is making trouble. I'm picking up activity in the launch bay...heads up! Enemy fighters!"

9347, "They're just a distraction. The other hangar bay is launching escape pods. They're going to jump clear and signal for help."

9348, "Laporte, take out the pods! Wargods, splash those fighters and give her some room to work!"

9349, "Yes, sir! Massacring escape pods!"

9350, "All pods splashed. I hope those things were unmanned, not full of panicked deckhands."

9351, "Clean kills on all three bandits. Slippery little creatures."

9352, "Warbird ejecting!"

9353, "I'm hit! I'm going down!"

9354, "Oh, bugger me!"

9355, "I heard they gave us leave for good looks."

9356, "With Olefumi around, it's no wonder the Yangtze never gets a break."

9357, "Next time Ogre's got a Tev on his six I think I'll just let things take their course. It's better for all of us."

9376, "Vacation's over. We're back to the war.

I'm just back from a conference with Captain Sorenson and Captain Kyrematen. The good news is that the last six days have done wonders for our combat readiness. The $f Indus and $f Yangtze have both used the $f Agincourt's capabilities to maximize their combat efficiency.

Our own fighters have been repaired, rearmed, and in some cases patched up with Tev equipment. Laporte, your ship had a faulty com unit, so you now have a Tev receiver$slashdecrypter installed. Don't let your Earther side get the better of you - I don't want any attempts to 'understand how they feel'."

9377, "The bad news is that traffic with the $f Agincourt - which remains under the control of our prize party - has had unintended consequences. Our entire backup pilot roster is sick with some kind of influenza variant they picked up from the Tev crew. Worse yet, someone in the press-ganged GTVA deck crew sabotaged several of our fighters while they were being tuned up on the $f Agincourt.

Between the Indus and Yangtze, we have seven flight-ready pilots, two gunships, and five Kentaurois. And, as I'm sure you've all anticipated, the $h GTVA is finally on to us."

9378, "Our destination gate is thirty minutes away on sublight. However, Lieutenant Levi's last recon run spotted the $r GTD $r Hood blockading the gate. It must have arrived within the last few hours and remained under sensor silence.

Five minutes ago, the hunter-killer corvette team $r Serkr jumped in to reinforce the $r Hood. Hey! Discipline! I know many of you have heard of $r Serkr. The $r Marcus $r Glaive, $r Pilum, and $r Hydra specialize in short-range subspace shock attacks, jumping in and eliminating warships.

We believe the Tevs plan to destroy the $f Indus and $f Yangtze, then recapture the $f Agincourt."

9379, "Hood"

9380, "Serkr Team"

9381, "We've obviously been detected, so we've signaled Admirals Netreba and Calder for backup. Judging by the terse replies we've received, they were ready for this contingency. Netreba is going to take the $f Eris and some artillery, along with our Wargod companions $f Katana and $f Altan $f Orde, and wreak havoc at the $h GTVA's Neptune fortifications. That should draw off Steele and the $r Atreus.

Admiral Calder is sending the jamming ship $f Anjaneya to help us fend off the $r Serkr corvettes. The $f Anjaneya has Jupiter's very best electronics aboard - if all goes well, she'll stymie their beam weapons entirely. Once their targeting is jammed, our frigates will engage with torpedoes, and hopefully destroy the $r Serkr threat once and for all."

9382, "If the $r Carthage remains in reserve to defend $r Artemis $r Station, then Admiral Calder will send us a torpedo strike division to help mop up. We get the $f Agincourt through the gate, and go home heroes.

Our role in all this is, as usual, to kill Tev fighters. There are only a few of us, so we all need to be in top form. We're rested and ready, and if we stay close to the $f Indus and $f Yangtze, our teamwork and point defenses should give us the upper hand against $r GTVA fighter sweeps. The $f Agincourt's guns will add to our fire pocket.

We will face skilled pilots in great numbers. It's the seven of us against the $h Hood's fighters. We must hold."

9383, "Toutatis"

9384, "Laporte, you're on my wing - after how many card games you've lost to me in the last couple days, I wouldn't have it any other way. Levi, you perpetual malcontent, you'll fly our three. 

Karen Ng'Mei and Olefumi off the $f Yangtze will fly $f Beta. Glance, Ogre, you're our gunship support."

9385, "Look, if you people want my opinion, I think something big is happening. The $f Agincourt alone is a huge target, but it's drawn out a Tev destroyer and other vital assets. I think Calder and Netreba are using the $f Agincourt as a catalyst for their own strategic plans.

I mean, think about it. The $r Hood is here, ready for the taking. The $r Atreus is occupied, the $r Carthage is probably going to play defense. The $r Imperieuse is out of the system. We have a golden opportunity here.

If we do our jobs here today, then maybe the Wargods will go down in history as the ones who turned the war around."

9386, "Six weeks ago we, as a people, were coasting towards defeat. Today, we put the Federation back into contention. 

With the capture of the Agincourt logistics ship, we've done nearly as much damage to GTVA infrastructure in this system as their Blitz did to us. Without the Agincourt, they can't pressure us to the same degree. Without pressure, we can hit back. And if we can hit back, that means Steele's plan for a decisive stroke at Earth is off. 

Better yet, we dealt significant damage to GTVA tactical assets. Serkr Team and the GTD Hood will be repairing at Artemis Station for several days, possibly weeks. Without those hunter-killers in the field, we can deploy our own warships more aggressively.

Admiral Netreba and Admiral Calder are in conference with Admiral Byrne and several Elders right now. I imagine the proverbial defecation has really hit the ventilation. Byrne wanted the Agincourt very badly, but my impression is that Calder and Netreba plan to use it to support a new offensive to retake Jupiter. The Agincourt has as much logistical capacity as three of our standard dockyards, and it's mobile.

The bad news from today was our own losses. The Tevs are reeling strategically, but tactically they were as strong as ever. Torpedo Two was murdered trying to assist us. In the Neptune fight, Admiral Steele gave Netreba's artillery a sound thrashing, and came near to catching the Eris itself. That man remains a menace.

The Indus and Yangtze will be in dock for several days, working back up after today's beating. We have been given exemption from Jump Five duties. 

While I ordinarily stay away from all-squadron social activities, I think the Wargods deserve some quality bonding time! Karen Ng'Mei has a place in Candor Chasma and the hiking is fabulous. I'll send a communique after the briefing, people."

9387, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

You can rest easy, Ken.

I think we might win this one after all."

9388, "With the failure of the Agincourt extraction, we're facing a total strategic collapse. The Tevs are launching punitive raids against Earth and Martian space, and they've discovered some real weaknesses in our force readiness. If Steele plays his cards right, the Atreus could be over Earth in less than forty-eight hours.

The Wargods are being disbanded as a failed experiment. We didn't have the skill or the courage to make our operation work. I wish it could've been different, pilots, but none of us should have even begun to nurse hope. This war's outcome has been written from day one, and we'll just have to play our parts to the bitter end.

So much for your bravado, huh, Laporte? Good luck on your next assignment. I doubt we'll live to see each other again."

9389, "Make sure to keep the Anjaneya jamming ship alive. When the Medea arrives, call in a bomber-heavy strike package as soon as possible.

If you're overwhelmed with fighters, send Beta Wing to guard the Anjaneya. If you lose the Anjaneya, send them to disarm the Hood's main beam. 

Try to keep Gamma Wing alive through the opening dogfight so you can use their firepower later to guard the Anjaneya. You can even send them to disarm the Medea's beams."

9390, "Six weeks ago we, as a people, were coasting towards defeat. Today, we put the Federation back into contention.

9487, "...how are we going to keep them from running away before we're done with them?"

9495, "Dof as they might be, they've got guts."

9496, "Pilots, we're detecting another Tev squadron jumping in. We've also got a launch from the Hood. They're piling it on."

9497, "Damn, that's a whole heavy assault squadron. Watch the Trebs. Two, you ready for more?"

9498, "Ready and eager, sir. I'm just getting warmed up."

9499, "Heads up, heads up! Artemis bomber strike inbound on the Anjaneya! Protect that ship, or the Hood will open up on us!"

9500, "We have a squadron of assault fighters jumping in. They're moving to strike the Yangtze and Indus."

9506, "The Marcus Glaive has exited the field of engagement. One less major threat."

9507, "Reading a subspace exit - there goes a Chimera corvette! Pulling the Hydra from the gunnery."

9508, "Indus, this is the Auxerre. Our ECM ship just went down. Can you lend us a few channels in case more Tev hunter-killers arrive?"

9509, "That's a negative, Auxerre. We need everything we've got to safeguard the Agincourt."

9510, "Wargods, this is Toutatis Actual. Steele just slipped a warship past me. You have a strike corvette inbound, ETA thirty seconds. Good luck. Calder out."

9511, "Sweet Fortune, what a jump! The Medea has emerged in broadside position and is commencing attack. Torpedo Strike Two, brace for beam fire!"

9512, "Wargods, Auxerre. We cannot hold against the Medea. We are trying to reach the Eris for help, but the Medea's jamming our transmissions! Advise!"

9513, "Auxerre, Yangtze. We're jammed as well. Hold the Medea off while we try to punch through."

9514, "Gods, she's relentless! We need to put some pressure on that corvette. Anyone have a bright idea?"

9515, "Indus Tac, Wargod Six, what's the status on that jamming? I need assets out here."

9516, "Stand by, Six. we're resolving a systems crisis. Handing you off to Yangtze Tactical."

9517, "Wargods, Yangtze Tactical. We're punching our way through, but it's going to take some time. Do what you can with current assets. Be aware that the Medea's slash beams can engage us even through ECM cover."

9518, "Wait, wait, Simms! I've got that Tev comm unit on board, and it's got green lights! Give me the codes for the Eris net!"

9519, "You think you can handle it, Laporte? ...yeah, me too. All right, here goes. Enter two-two-niner bravo hotel seven-six-one kilo, then hold to authenticate. "

9542, "Heads up, pilots. Kulas squadron inbound, five klicks. Don't let them bounce you."

9543, "We've got a fire on the hangar deck and shearing damage in secondary structural members. Step up your efforts, pilots."

9545, "The Yangtze...she's gone. Lorna, my ship..."

9546, "Pilots, the Tev attack has slackened off. Disarm weapons subsystems on the nearby corvettes so our torpedoes can get through."

9547, "Be careful, all of you. This is no easy task. Beware the beams!"

9548, "Their weapons are busy with incoming torpedoes. We should have a clear shot at it."

9549, "Pilots, with the Medea down, we should be able to contact other Fleet elements. Stand by."

9550, "Indus, Wargods Six. Can we get some additional firepower to deal with that command carrier parked in front of the gate?"

9551, "Ekse, you lot, what d'you think the Hood's doing? Just loomin' there throwing out fighters instead of takin' a bliks at us?"

9552, "She can't bite hard without her forward beams. She must be recalling more fighters."

9553, "Looks like they're still having trouble with the Anjaneya's jamming."

9554, "Wargods, this is Admiral Calder. I am prepping the Toutatis for relief action. I will not be able to recover my screen, so I trust you to provide fighter cover."

9555, "Lorna, we're in rough shape. If the Tevs sortie a hunter-killer team, or enough bombers, we could lose that destroyer."

9556, "Between his squadrons and Netreba's feint, the Tevs are occupied. It's INDRA 2 all over again, only this time Calder is on our side. We just need to do our jobs."

9557, "Prepared to assault the Hood or engage hostile bombers, sir. Let's do this."

9558, "We're going down, we're going down. This is Torpedo Two, signing off. Stand clear of our blast!"

9559, "Those Jovians died to buy us time! Let's not screw this up!"

9560, "Magazine firebreaks are going! We're - *static*"

9561, "The Agincourt prize party reports that the ship's armor has been badly compromised and at least one hold is open to space. That ship is the reason we're here, pilots - keep it safe!"

9562, "Oh, you're kidding me! The Agincourt just went critical!"

9563, "Oh, no...I was so sure we were going to do this..."

9564, "That's it, pilots. We've got no more reason to stay here. Get yourselves home, fastest jump solution."

9565, "Gunships, standing by! Ready for fighter suppression or torpedo mission!"

9566, "Fleet bombers on station...just give us a target and some escort, and we'll pave the road."

9567, "Precision strike team, inbound on Medea weapons."

9568, "Gunship saturation strike inbound on the Medea. Warhammers hot."

9571, "Durga bombers, ready for high-intensity strike operations. Ready for your orders, Agincourt team."

9572, "Upsilon wing interceptors, ready to banzai hostile fighters and take out turrets. Orders?"

9573, "We did it! The Medea is coming apart! Good strike call, Laporte, that was brilliant work!"

9574, "<intercepted> Hood, Medea. Our end run is going poorly. Resistance is fierce."

9575, "<intercepted> All hands, brace to maneuver. Bring the stinger beam to bear and stand by for subspace exit."

9576, "Wargods, this is Calder. I am closing on the Hood. Her AWACS is scrambling my torpedo locks, and I need my torpedoes. Destroy it."

9577, "Come on, you inglorious Tev bastard! You know your precious ship won't make it...break and run!"

9578, "The field is ours. Captain Martache, stand down to Condition Two and begin damage assessment."

9579, "Sir, this is Captain Sorensen, JTF Wargods. We have retrieved the target and are prepared to return it to Earth."

9580, "Congratulations, Captain. You just bit off a quarter of the Tevs' logistical ability and gave us our first real victory of the war."

9581, "That logistics ship is a treasure trove. I'm not handing it over to Earth. Netreba and I have other plans."

9582, "Sir! Admiral Byrne's standing orders are to deliver all captured GTVA technology for his project. Isn't this mutiny?"

9583, "The Martian Concordia and Jovian Systems Republic do not answer to Byrne. We answer to the Elders. And while they are wise leaders, they are not warriors."

9584, "At 0800 this morning Admiral Netreba and I informed Byrne that Second and Third Fleets are now autonomous commands."

9585, "Admiral Byrne and the Elders are committed to a defensive war that will bring the Tevs to the negotiating table. That strategy is fatally flawed."

9586, "You'll find no disagreement here, Admiral. We're all glad to be finally hitting back."

9587, "Then, Captain, you'll be overjoyed to hear that at 0800 this morning Admiral Netreba and I informed Byrne that Second and Third Fleets are now autonomous commands."

9588, "The Elders are our spiritual leaders, but they are not warriors. In spite of their...optimism, we can't afford to wage war the same way we waged peace."

9589, "Hot damn! Karen, you owe me a fiver!"

9590, "Sir, if Second and Third Fleet plan to bring the war to the GTVA, the Wargods stand ready."

9591, "Admiral Calder, while I fully support this decision, isn't it mutiny?"

9592, "The Jovian Systems Republic and Martian Concordia are independent nations. We are equals to Byrne and First Fleet. We simply choose to no longer recognize his de facto command. Is that clear to all of you?"

9593, "Crystal clear, Admiral. So long as we still pay our respects to the Elders."

9594, "Admiral Steele's plan to stage a single, decisive battle at Earth leaves the GTVA vulnerable to counterattack during the buildup. He's going for the throat, and Netreba and I plan to kick him in the balls."

9595, "Taking out the Agincourt will gut their supply chain. They'll need another four or five months of preparation. We will exploit this advantage."

9596, "Sir! I have something to say."

9597, "Damn it, Laporte, keep quiet! Calder will bust your balls for so much as coughing without permission!"

9598, "Pilot, do you have an objection to this task force's new assignment?"

9599, "No, sir! I just wanted to express my thanks, and convey my wishes that Admiral Byrne would grow the balls to make this decision himself."

9600, "My time with the Wargods has given me something to believe in, sir: the men and women alongside me. And, for the record, I wish Admiral Byrne had the balls to make this decision himself. I'm with you, sir."

9601, "Sublieutenant Laporte, your willingness to speak ill of a superior officer in an undisciplined tirade fills me with..."

9602, "...a certain ill-advised respect. Consider yourself forgiven. Possibly even acknowledged."

9603, "Now get the Agincourt through that gate before Steele disentangles himself and comes running to save his career."

9604, "My God, Laporte, you're still on flight status. I can't believe Calder let you off."

9605, "Nice speech, Sublieutenant. Did you have that all written out on some flowered stationery? Taped up in your cockpit?"

9606, "I bet he loved your input, Laporte. He'll probably make you Special Requisitions Officer for Byrne's Testicles or something."

9607, "Oh, hush. You know how I get on combat high."

9608, "All right, Wargods. Looks like we're going to win this war all on our own. Let's jump home and get started."

9609, "Uh-oh, there goes the Anjaneya. We've lost our ECM cover. Someone needs to nail the Hood's forward beams once this wave passes."

9610, "Anjaneya here! If we go down, the Hood will vaporize this task force! Give us cover!"

9611, "Here they come, Wargods!"

9612, "The Medea has achieved a partial beam lock! She's about to open fire!"

9613, "Seven of us against a destroyer and a hunter-killer team. How are we supposed to -"

9614, "Don't write those bombers off yet, people! The Tevs will use staggered deployments! Watch for more waves trying to sneak in!"

9615, "We just lost the Dea Bricta!"

9616, "This is your aristeia, Noemi. Fight, and you will triumph."

9617, "I don't think we want to keep him waiting. Banzai that AWACS, Wargods! Watch the escorts!"

9618, "The Hood's AWACS cover is gone. Can you achieve a lock, Toutatis?"

9619, "Affirmative. All torpedo stations, get me salvo fire on the Hood. Show them out."

9620, "Gunnery, target the Hood's main beam emitter with the CG-4s."

9621, "Run home, little Tev. Tell Steele I'm coming for him."

9622, "Copy that, Admiral. Wargods, return to the Agincourt and stand by for contact. We don't have a vector on her arrival yet."

9623, "The Hood and its AWACS have begun an electronic warfare attack on us. We cannot overcome the Medea's noise!"

FleetNet Admiralty Communique
FROM: Admiral Netreba, CINC2MF
TO: 2nd Fleet Wargods, JTFW2/3

To the serving officers and crew of the 'Wargods' Elite Task Force,

Find attached the transcript of the meeting between the Fleet Admirals and the High Council of Elders at Jiuhua Shan, Anhui Province.

The points of contention involved the declaration of autonomy by Second Fleet and the Third Fleet exiles. You can read the subsequent ruling of the Council regarding this matter, but it will be sufficient to note that the First Fleet Admiralty no longer dictates our military policy. However, we will still obey the will of the Council in non-military matters, and the Martian government still acknowledges Federation authority."

9648, "The second, imperative point of contention concerned the fate of the $f GTL $f Agincourt. It was my intention to recommission the $f Agincourt into the registry of the Second Fleet as a support vessel, using the precedent of the $f GTL $f Solace when she defected to Federation authority last year. She now serves as part of the Home Fleet in a classified capacity. Admiral Calder supported my proposition. The motion was denied by the Council, and an order handed down for the immediate transport of the vessel to Earth. In their words, the $f Agincourt is no longer a military asset, and is now the property of the $f Federation $f Science $f Institute.

My official position on this matter is the same as Admiral Calder's: we will support the Elders in this and have thus relinquished control of the $f Agincourt. Despite this setback, I expect each of you to do your duty to the best of your ability, and I have every confidence that we will prevail in this conflict.

Admiral Kyle Netreba
UED Eris
Second Fleet Mars"

9649, "$b *** $b  FORWARDED $b  COMMUNIQUE $b ***
FleetNet Admiralty Communique
FROM: Admiral Byrne, CINC1EHF
TO: Admiral Netreba, CINC2MF, Admiral Calder, CINC3JRF

Netreba, Calder.

What in the devil's name are you two playing at? Autonomy? I've given you autonomy enough these past eighteen months, to the near ruin of us all. Given, your $f Wargods did well in securing the Agincourt, but Admiral Calder's fixation with the destruction of $r Serkr $r Team threw two cruisers and an ECM asset right into Tev hands. Admiral Netreba's stunt at $r Neptune damaged his artillery ships and nearly cost us the $f Eris. A single reactionary artillery strike at the $r Hood would have saved lives, and secured the Agincourt sooner."

9650, "If you two insist on continuing these frontier antics, then there is little I can do. I've told you enough times that these are only temporary victories against a determined and highly adaptable enemy. The Tevs can afford destroyer casualties: we're barely getting by on cruiser and strikecraft attrition.

Your faith in your fleets is admirable, but we won't win this conflict through force of arms. It is not who we are. Would that your faith in the Elders be stronger, in the times when we must rely on it the most.

Admiral Byrne
UED Solaris
Home Fleet"

9651, "Ok, people. Leave ended twelve hours ago, so quiet down! As you've probably seen, the $f Indus' time in dock came with some extra perks. We're now one of the very few frigates in Two Fleet with functioning hot showers. My momma always said that heroism paid big dividends.

While we were cavorting around on leave, some very disturbing political developments have occurred. These events are a direct result of our capture of the $f GTL $f Agincourt. Unfortunately, it appears that $r Admiral $r Steele had a contingency plan for the loss of one or both of his logistics ships. That plan may now be in its first stages, and with luck, we can disrupt it."

9652, "Six minutes ago, recon elements picked up a distress call from an unregistered freighter outside the asteroid belt, under attack by the $r Gaian $r Effort. The recon wing moved in to check out the situation and possibly confiscate the freighter's cargo.

It turns out the ship wasn't Tev, but Vasudan. Yes, it seems the Imperium has finally decided to pay us a visit, and we've been chosen to be part of their welcoming committee."

9653, "Pesedjet"

9654, "The $v Pesedjet is a Vasudan logistics ship in the vein of the $h GTL $h Anemoi, and from what Intel's gathered about these ships, they seem pretty similar to their Tev counterparts: big, slow and poorly armed. A prime target for pretty much any hostile force in this system.

The Vasudan ship was ambushed during a navigational adjustment between intrasystem hops. Somehow the Gefs knew where this adjustment would occur...which seems impossible, as jump schedules are tightly classified. But that's a job for Netreba's intel personnel."

9655, "Now, technically we're not at war with the Vasudans, but they are still allies with the $h General $h Terran $h Assembly. Admiral Netreba wants us to secure control of the freighter, assist their crew, and get some answers from the Captain regarding their standing orders. We need to know where the Vasudans stand in this war, and whether or not Emperor Khonsu II has decided to throw his weight behind the Tev push into our system. Our fear is that Khonsu has elected to support Steele logistically.

Laporte, you'll be my second. Levi, you're Alpha 3. Courtney and McManus, take up Beta wing."

9656, "Ok, pilots. First, I want everyone to know that I'm proud of the way you handled yourselves out there today. All of you managed to hold the ceasefire long enough for the Pesedjet to receive assistance. What happened to the Arethusa afterwards was regrettable, considering the conduct of the Tevs throughout the operation, but this is a war.

The crew of the Pesedjet are grateful for our assistance. We're in the process of interrogating Captain Apries regarding the Pesedjet's operations in the system. Latest word is that he's been cooperative and civil so far. You can expect to hear the results of that soon, but for now it looks like there's no danger of a Vasudan battlegroup coming to make life difficult for us. In fact, by saving the Pesedjet, we may have given ourselves the diplomatic edge we need to keep the Vasudans out of the war.

What is worrying, however is the increasing abilities of the Gaian Effort. The Pesedjet was ambushed at a navigational point that should have been secret and secure. Somehow, the Gefs knew the Vasudans would be there, which suggests both abilities and motivations unknown to us. Intelligence is revising what we know about the terrorist group. We're not a police force, but you can expect Netreba to divert assets into combating this terrorist threat to secure our own freight assets.

What I want to know is this: if the Gefs are working for the Tevs - and Laporte, you've seen Tev transports in Gef hands  - why would they provoke the Vasudans? Have they gone rogue, or just nuts?"

9657, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

I need to look at the transmission from the Pesedjet next time I get a chance. I wonder what it could be...and why I didn't report it. Just one of those feelings..."

9658, "That humanitarian mission turned into more than a disaster. We were lucky to come out of there in one piece. I don't know what the hell happened, but the Vasudans are furious, and they've pledged official support for the Galactic Terrans.

With the Vasudans now giving logistical support to the Terrans, we face an impossible strategic conundrum. We can't allow the Tevs to gain an uncontested logistical train. But we can't attack the Vasudans without provoking them further.

Our conduct out there today was unacceptable. We may have just lost the war."

9681, "Marines, you must get clear of the airlock! We're reading an explosive device inside the dock!"

9682, "Detonation detected. Marines, report your status!"

9683, "This is Tactical Two. We have suffered major casualties. The explosion buckled several bulkheads and left multiple compartments open to space."

9684, "Retreat, retreat! This operation's gone to hell!"

9685, "Those Gef bastards bit off more than they could chew. I wonder what drove them to attack the Vasudans...didn't we think they were working for the Tevs?"

9686, "Pesedjet, this is Captain Sorensen of the UEFg Indus, Second Fleet Mars. We received your distress signal and are here to provide assistance. What is your status?"

9687, "You are speaking to Captain Apries of the Pesedjet. The Gef boarding party inflicted damage to our fuel processors. We have multiple cases of radiation exposure and flash burns. Our emergency response teams have been overwhelmed."

9688, "CIC, this is Engineering. Reactor containment has been compromised. We have multiple cases of radiation exposure and flash burns. Our emergency response teams have been overwhelmed."

9689, "We've got a medical transport on two-minute standby, Captain Apries. Our medics have been brought up to speed on Vasudan physiology. Permission to proceed."

9690, "Permission denied, Captain Sorensen. Under GTVA protocol, we cannot submit our vessel to your authority."

9691, "We're not asking for your surrender, Captain Apries. Federation policy is to offer support to all neutral vessels in distress. Our hands are open."

9692, "This is not a neutral vessel. Under the Deneb Convention, your government is designated a hostile power. As such, we have no choice but to respond to any attempted boardings with force."

9693, "Are...are the Vasudans rejecting our medical assistance? Are they insane?"

9694, "Think about it this way, Levi. The Gefs are a lot like their Hammer of Light. Would you let a bunch of Vasudans board your ship after an attack by those nutjobs?"

9695, "If we're falling back on technicalities, Captain, last I checked our government was at war with the General Terran Assembly, not the Imperium. Consider this a token of friendship from a society that shares much in common with your own."

9696, "We have no quarrel with your Emperor. "

9697, "Your actions are honourable, Captain Sorensen, but I cannot help but doubt your intentions. We are quite aware of the role that your ship played in the capture of the GTL Agincourt."

9698, "I'm sure you'll see the difference between action against an enemy target and a mission of mercy, Pesedjet. Scan the Littman, and you'll find no weapons on board."

9699, "Your medical ship appears to be what it seems, Captain Sorensen. Our situation leaves us little choice. Send the Littman, and only the Littman, to the port dock. I will have a marine detachment meet your medical team at the airlock."

9700, "Ladies and gentlemen of the Indus Wargods. Looks like we're privileged enough to witness the first contact between Earth and Vasudan forces in fifty years."

9701, "Their ship...it's as though someone took a sea creature, blew it up to destroyer proportions and installed some turrets on the outside. Vasudan craftsmanship to the core."

9702, "Similar, but at the same time not like the Tevs. You can tell Tev ships are war machines, they have a sort of deadly beauty to them. The Vasudans have the same beauty, but none of the menace."

9703, "I'd do anything just to talk to one of them. I've read stories about their culture. Martin Mandho said that Khonsu was closer to spiritual enlightenment than many of our Elders."

9704, "Spiritually enlightened or not, their beams are going to be just as terrifying when they're aimed at our ships. Until they're helping us kick the Tevs out of our system, I'm not going to expect a damned thing from them."

9705, "Really, Captain? There's no curiosity down under all that Martian gruff? Permit me to quote the intel database: 'a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars.' You're not intrigued?"

9706, "I once attended a lecture given by one of the Epsilon Four. He answered questions afterwards about what it was like being one of the only Vasudans left in Sol. Of course, they say the Vasudans were with the Fedayeen..."

9707, "Khonsu invited the Epsilon Four to Aldebaran for a ceremony of honour. They all received an Imperial Order of Vasuda, last I heard."

9708, "Really, Laporte? That's pretty neat. How did you find this out?"

9709, "Captain Sorensen, we're picking up a jump point forming nearby! Hostile configuration!"

9710, "Looks like the Tevs got the distress call too. All crew to battlestations! Fighter wings, take up escort positions around the Indus and Littman. Do not engage unless fired upon."

9711, "Weapons hold, Alpha and Beta wings! Do not fire until I say! Keep away from those Tev ships."

9712, "GTCv Arethusa to Federation vessels. The Pesedjet is under our protection. Stand down your vessels and leave, or we will open fire."

9713, "This is Captain Sorensen of the UEFg Indus. Negative on your demands, Arethusa. We are engaged in a medical mission and will defend ourselves."

9714, "Damned Tev! Get off my tail! Indus control, permission to open fire!"

9715, "Don't make me laugh, Captain. Medical mission? This is clearly another attack on our logistics by a desperate military. Leave now, or suffer the consequences."

9716, "Captain Price, we can vouch for their actions thus far. The Indus and her fighters assisted in driving off an attack by the Gaian Effort. We are transmitting logs."

9717, "Acknowledged, Pesedjet. We believe some Gaian Effort cells may be working for the Federation's black ops unit. This is likely an attempt on your ship."

9718, "Their teams aboard my vessel are unarmed. They did not exhibit any suspicious behavior."

9719, "These records seem to check out, Captain Apries. But we've got bigger problems. Your ship's hull integrity is dropping fast. We need to deploy teams to help contain internal fires and lock down damage."

9720, "Captain Sorenson, unless you want a firefight aboard a dying ship, withdraw at once. Your rescue efforts are neither welcome nor needed. We will use force if necessary."

9721, "We don't have time for this, Captain. These Vasudans are in need of medical assistance! Unless you want to explain to the Emperor why his soldiers had to die, let us do our jobs!"

9722, "WARNING: LONG RANGE COMMUNICATIONS DISABLED. RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS."

9723, "Holy - Indus control, I'm getting red lights on my board. Long-range communications are down!"

9724, "Captain Sorensen, we don't have time for this posturing! The clock's ticking on the Pesedjet's reactor failure!"

9725, "Captain Price, we're picking up massive jamming from your corvette. What is the meaning of this?"

9726, "A little insurance policy, Captain Sorensen. You want to do things your way, fine. Help out the Vasudans, but no reinforcements."

9727, "GTT Sampson, on approach to dock with Pesedjet's ventral airlock. Federation forces, if you are armed, hold your fire."

9728, "In which case, Captain, I'm sure you won't object to us returning the favour. Comms, hit them with a wide-frequency blast. Jam their long-ranged communications."

9729, "This is Medic Team Alpha! We're experiencing massive internal detonations! The Vasudan engineers we're patching up say that internal safeties have failed!"

9730, "Damn! We're scrambling repair equipment from the Indus, but it's going to be several minutes before we can load a shuttle. Do the best you can with what you have."

9731, "We've got repair technicians with heavy field equipment on board the Sampson. Standard procedure for answering a stricken vessel. You could learn from our example next time."

9732, "And your transport carries only the barest medical facilities, Captain. If your engineers save the ship, we'll save the crew. Once the Pesedjet is out of danger...we'll work from there."

9733, "Touche, Captain Sorensen."

9734, "Touche, Captain Sorensen. Here's my proposal. We stand down, and you do the same. We pool our resources, repair this Vasudan ship, and then we go our separate ways."

9735, "The Vasudans continue to help us supply, while you gain favour with Khonsu for when you negotiate the terms of your surrender."

9736, "Indus, I'm reading a global weapons power down on the Arethusa and Tev fighters. They've disengaged and are pulling back."

9737, "What extraordinary times we live in. Very well, Captain Price. The welfare of the Pesedjet will take precedence for now. However, if you do anything to compromise the ceasefire, we will not hesitate to open fire."

9738, "Red and black ants, building bowling alleys together from caterpillar teeth."

9739, "This is doing my head in. Sitting this close to Tevs without shots firing."

9740, "Normally I'd be itching to open fire, but...do you think this is how it was supposed to be? That maybe this is the first sane thing that's happened since the Tevs showed up?"

9741, "This is Medic Team Alpha. Engineer crisis teams have managed to seal off compromised areas. Radiation levels are falling, and we've managed to secure most of the surviving crew. Good thing those techs came when they did."

9742, "Ever the romantic, Laporte. Frankly, this is absurd. Sooner or later we'll be shooting at each other again. Let's just get it over with."

9743, "If you ask me, a little danger brings a certain buzz to first meetings. Has anyone ever told you how lovely you sound on the comm?"

9744, "Lieutenant Fabian Kurniadi. at your service. 181st Bloodhounds squadron, GTD Carthage. Callsign 'Anansi'...goodness knows why."

9745, "Captain Lorna Simms, Indus Wargods. Now you'll know who I am when our little hugbox breaks up and I kill you."

9746, "Only one side can win. Choose."

9747, "..."

9748, "It is the way of things. You must choose."

9749, "Sublieutenant Noemi Laporte, Indus Wargods. Have a care with Captain Simms, Tev. You don't want her on the wrong side of the IFF spectrum."

9750, "So I've heard. Your squadron has Admiral Steele's attention, Sublieutenant Laporte. You lot seem determined to win this war all by yourself."

9751, "It's always good to verify our strategic impact from a human source, Lieutenant Kurniadi. How about some hard numbers? What's the bounty on my head? "

9752, "Big enough to make me take notice, and my father's a shipping magnate. The catch is, of course, that no one survives to collect...or I'm sure I would have heard reports of your charms."

9753, "This is a bad line of work for an amateur Casanova, Lieutenant. When you get shot down out here, it's dangerously literal."

9754, "Medic Team Alpha here. Preliminary triage has been completed. We're moving the critically wounded onto the Littman for emergency care. I wish to state for the record that the conduct of GTVA engineering teams has been more than exemplary."

9755, "Acknowledged, MT Alpha. Good work. Well, Captain Price, it seems thanks are in order."

9756, "Eyes up pilots, new contact! It's the heavy frigate Hesperia!"

9757, "Priority message to Captain Aldred. Tell him to cease fire immediately, the Arethusa is a non-combatant!"

9758, "Scorpio wing and the Arethusa have gone weapons hot!"

9759, "Littman, you are to disengage from the Pesedjet. We're pulling you out of the battlezone."

9760, "Commencing undocking process now. Be advised, we've got Vasudan wounded on board. Captain Apries has demanded that we return them before we undock."

9761, "There's no time, Littman. Get out of there now, before the Tevs make you a target!"

9762, "Pilots, evasive manoeuvres! Watch the fire, it's close quarters at the moment!"

9763, "The Arethusa has opened fire!"

9764, "So much for a ceasefire. All batteries, return fire. Fighters, form a defensive screen!"

9765, "The Littman has made it out. Pilots, follow us back to Mars on the double!"

9766, "Oh, damn it...Tev fighters on an attack run! The Arethusa has opened fire!"

9767, "We surrender, you traitorous sons of bitches! Hold your fire!"

9768, "Hesperia, this is the Indus. The Arethusa was assisting our humanitarian mission for the Pesedjet. You've just destroyed a non-combatant under a ceasefire."

9769, "Ceasefire? Pardon me, Captain Sorensen, but I got no notice from Command that such a ceasefire was in place. Admiral Calder deployed us to secure the area after we lost contact with you. The Arethusa was a hostile target, and by definition a combatant."

9770, "Seems like the status quo has returned to this little area of space, Laporte. How do you fancy the outcome of this 'humanise the enemy' experiment?"

9771, "I can't complain, One. We're still alive. But I can't help but wonder what would have happened if it had lasted a little longer..."

9772, "Still, I guess best intentions aren't enough to stop the fighting. It's too late for that. This war won't end until one side wins...and I'd rather it be us."

9773, "Laporte, we'll make a Martian of you yet."

9774, "Pilots, this mission is over. Bring yourselves in. Gamma wing from the Hesperia will take over escort duty."

9789, "$b *** $b  FLEET WIDE $b  COMMUNIQUE $b  ***
General Distribution, Priority Urgent
FROM: Council of Elders
TO: All Serving Military Personnel

This is a priority message.

At 1420 hours yesterday, elements of $f Second $f Fleet $f Mars encountered and assisted the stricken logistics vessel $v Pesedjet of the $v Imperial $v Vasudan $v Medjai. It is now clear that $v Emperor $v Khonsu $v II's stance of neutrality has been abandoned, and that the Vasudans have now entered the war on the side of the $r Galactic $r Terran $r Assembly.

This is dire news for our fortunes in this war, and for our survival as a Federation.

So far Medjai support seems to be limited to logistics and freight only, but it has increased pressure on what was already a precarious situation. Vasudan vessels are not to be targeted, else we risk provoking the Emperor into providing direct military assistance to his Terran allies.

Diplomatic sessions are now underway between the Federation and the Imperium. If we can persuade Emperor Khonsu to deny the Assembly support, we will be one step closer to victory. Until then, we urge our military leaders to halt any activity that might provoke the Vasudans into catastrophic intervention.

For humanity, children of Ubuntu."

9790, "Okay, Laporte, take a seat. Don't look so surprised - Admiral Netreba just passed down a special assignment. It's just the two of us on this one.

As per yesterday's declassified memo, the Council of Elders is sending a delegation to Khonsu's representative in Sol, $v Admiral $v Recamai. Recamai's ship, the $v GVD $v Shepseskaf, is currently holding station in neutral territory near Charon. Since the $f Wargods were present during the $v Pesedjet operation, Command has asked me to send two fighter pilots to join up with the delegation's escort wing. 

Our presence should help give some extra leverage with the Vasudans, who are likely to react to us positively."

9791, "Luna"

9792, "In fact, someone from the Pesedjet's crew requested you specifically. I have no idea why that might be, and Netreba didn't tell me. I can't help but question the good sense of the Vasudan species as a whole.

We'll meet up with the transport $f Reshadiye at Luna City, which was spared by the Tev bombardment in a humanitarian gesture. Two members of the $g White $g Guard are already on station as part of the Elder's security detail.

From there, we'll jump to a classified meeting location in the Kuiper Belt, where Admiral Recamai will meet us on a transport - bringing a destroyer along would draw Tev attention."

9793, "Reshadiye"

9794, "$f Elder $f Svetlana $f Henriksson was the obvious choice for this mission, as she worked with Vasudan physicists during the Great War and maintains close ties with Admiral Netreba. Unfortunately, she's in no physical condition for high-stress negotiation at the moment and had to decline.

The delegation will instead be led by $f Elder $f Lin $f Taudigani, who I am told is one of our finest political scientists and xenocultural specialists. She allegedly speaks Vasudan in both the sitting and standing forms. Very smart lady.

Remember, we're escorting an Elder to meet another species. If you can manage to act like a proper flight officer for just one day, make it today!"

9926, "Roger that, Sir Leatt. Glad to be here."

9927, "You really are, aren't you, Captain? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were impressed."

9929, "Wow, boss, I'm thunderstruck. You're dangerously close to expressing an emotion other than casual rage."

9930, "I miss Mars. I miss looking out at the rust desert and the dome lights, feeling proud of what we'd built...what Ubuntu built. We really had something special here, didn't we?"

9931, "The human spirit, finally unchained. That was what Elder Mandho used to tell me. Dad said it was a nicely paced socioeconomic boom. My mom just called it paradise."

9932, "A place where every last human had the drive and the ability to work to her full potential. And once we had that, we'd go back to the stars, and nothing would stop us."

9936, "I think they lost something out there, and we have to -"

9937, "How can you not hate them? We've seen thousands die at their hands. Name a single good thing that's come from this atrocity!"

9938, "Remember when we were staying at Karen's place on Mars? And you started yelling at Levi in your sleep, and then fell out of your bunk?"

9939, "Alpha wing, Knights. Elder Taudigani is aboard the shuttle, and final flight preparations are complete. We're reading a lot of comm traffic between your fighters - is there a problem?"

9940, "We've just been given the all-clear by Luna Spaceport. Now charging up our subspace drives. All fighters, form up around us and prepare to warp out."

9941, "Engaging subspace drives. Follow our lead, pilots."

9942, "No problems, Control. My wingman and I were just, uh, complimenting your architecture."

9943, "Captain?"

I heard you crack when they splashed the Elder, Laporte. There was nothing you could have done to save her. The Tevs wanted her dead, and if there's one thing they excel at, it's getting their way by force.

But keep that anger close. It'll keep you alive.

The Vasudans are in a fury. The Imperium has formally severed diplomatic ties with the Federation pending a full investigation into today's events and the alleged 'falsified assassination of Elder Taudigani.'  That bastard Steele's SOC thugs manufactured evidence framing us for the attack on the Pesedjet and the attempted capture of the destroyer Shepseskaf. I bet they leaked the Pesedjet's jump schedule to their Gef pets, too. I think it's safe to say that we won't be earning any Vasudan support.

I've received the following statement from Admiral Netreba:

$quoteThe death of Elder Taudigani is not only a tragedy, but a turning point. It marks the total failure of Admiral Byrne's commitment to defensive action and a diplomatic resolution to the war.

Admiral Calder and I have concluded that immediate, aggressive reprisals are necessary. We have prepared a two-pronged plan to strike a shattering blow to the Tev presence in Sol and effect a military resolution to the war.

While Admiral Calder regenerates his Fleet's fighter assets, I will commit the resources of Second Fleet and the Wargods to a short-term plan to wipe out a Tev destroyer.

The GTD Carthage is our target. Prepare your pilots for the first op.$quote

So that's the word from Netreba. The blood's in the water, and we're in for some major fleet action.

Look, you seem ready to puke. Let's hit the gym and spar - you need to work some of that off."

9957, "There was nothing you could have done to save Elder Taudigani."

9958, "The UET Reshadiye was lost before the negotiations could proceed. Admiral Netreba's review of our escort operation has...not been favorable.

10033, "Not like they had a choice, Laporte."

10034, "It was a difficult time for the Jovian military. Having the smallest fleet, and largest area to patrol, it just turned out to be too costly to police the area properly."

10053, "Damn! Reshadiye, Tev AWACS. Jumped out before we could destroy it. We got it on guncam."

10083, "Elder, I'm honored, but we are in a very dangerous place. What do you need of me?"

10085, "...what? I don't really think about -"

10086, "It must be hard for you to reconcile Ubuntu with your duties."

10087, "Elder, I don't think this is the time or place to have this conversation."

10088, "You are deeply afraid of yourself, aren't you?"

10089, "I don't know what you think I -"

10090, "If what I have learned is true, then you should be. But I wanted to ask you myself, before I spoke to the other Elders."

10092, "The Elder's shuttle is away. Assume escort formation."

10096, "We just lost all telemetry from the shuttle! Widow Eight-Two, check in!"

10097, "Elder Taudigani is dead, Reshadiye. We have failed."

10098, "Spineless, murdering cowards! They're going to burn for this!"

10099, "I've got clear guncam footage of those stealth fighters, Laporte. The Vasudans won't stand for this."

10100, "We shall soon see. The GVD Shepseskaf has entered the area."

10101, "I am Admiral Recamai of the Medjai, personal representative of Emperor Khonsu the Second. I see that Admiral Steele's warnings were well-founded."

10102, "Admiral Recamai, this is most irregular. You asked for a discreet meeting limited to two fighters and a transport. Instead, you arrive in a fully armed warship. What is the meaning of this?"

10103, "Less than four hours ago, Admiral Steele's SOC operatives uncovered your plan to shatter the Terran$slashVasudan alliance. Your Gaian Effort allies of the Kostadin cell have already confessed."

10104, "Steele lies! The Gaian Effort attacked us, aided and abetted by your allies. Elder Taudigani is dead, slain mere moments ago by Alliance assassins. We have proof."

10105, "The youngest in a flock of lies. Your Kostadin agents disabled the Pesedjet so that you could come to its 'rescue' and earn our favor. You destroyed the Arethusa under flag of truce."

10106, "Now you would use the sacrifice of an empty shuttle and forged visual records to buy our outrage. Steele warned us of this gambit. We will not be played."

10107, "Sir Leatt, I'm picking up more Gef fighters jumping in!"

10108, "<intercepted> All right, Kostadin Cell, let's begin the disable operation. The Buntu capture team will be here any second now, and they want this ship ready to storm."

10109, "I don't believe it. They're working for the Tevs...but they're pretending to work for us."

10110, "Helm, flash the secondary reactors for an emergency jump. This ship will not be taken by treachery."

10111, "Someone on the inside sold us out to Steele. And when I find them, I'm going to make bracelets out of their guts."

10112, "Alpha Wing, you must return your guncam records to the Elders intact! We will cover the Reshadiye until she can make repairs. Go!"

Restricted Distribution, Priority Urgent, Compartmentalized Information
FROM: Captain Sorensen
TO: Captain Lorna Simms, Sublieutenant Noemi Laporte, Flight Lieutenant Ehud Levi
CC: Flight Lieutenant Karen Ng'Mei, UEFg Yangtze

I've just returned from a conference with Admiral Netreba and the other Wargods captains. The situation is grim. Deep-range recon reports that the Vasudan logistical train is gearing up, and supplies are pouring through the node and into Steele's Jovian depots. We can't attack the Vasudan supply convoys without escalating the war further. Without pressure on his logistics, Steele's final attack on Earth could happen within weeks instead of months.

All our gains are in danger of slipping away. Admiral Calder and Admiral Netreba have decided to take aggressive direct action. We believe that if we can eliminate a Terran destroyer, we will deal a critical blow to Tev morale and political support.

Our target is the $r GTD $r Carthage."

10131, "The $r Carthage is an Orion-class destroyer that saw service during the Second Shivan Incursion. Although her spaceframe is obsolete, she has been refitted as a Combat Evaluation Unit destroyer. We believe the $r Carthage mounts a prototype tactical subspace drive that allows it to make rapid sequential short-range jumps, akin to the capabilities of the $r GTD $r Atreus. Additionally, her weapons systems have been upgraded to modern standards, and her hull has been reinforced with molybdenum plating and experimental reactive armor that grants her enhanced resilience against our artillery weapons and torpedoes.

Admiral Steele employs the $r Carthage as a raider and a base for aggressive fighter and bomber deployments. The destroyer's impressive firepower makes it a difficult target. Projections indicate that we will need to engage with at least four frigates to guarantee a kill without warship losses. We must carry out this operation without significant casualties in order to maintain our momentum.

Fortunately, we have a critical edge: a source inside the $r GTVA who has provided us with tactical information on the $r Carthage's upcoming operations and a psychological profile of the Carthage's commander. This is the same source that gave us the $f Agincourt, and he or she has come through again. We know exactly how to hit them."

10132, "Information on Admiral Anita Lopez has been added to your techroom database. I will summarize the salient points. Admiral Lopez is a veteran GTVA officer, decorated for heroism during the Second Shivan Incursion due to her actions as acting CO of the $r Carthage. She commands a remarkable degree of respect and loyalty from her crew and the crews of her battlegroup's ships. Psychological analysts suggests she displays a 'transformational leadership' profile, characterized by intense personal bonds between herself and her subordinates.

We plan to exploit this mutual loyalty to draw Lopez into a trap.

Our source inside the GTVA tells us that the $r Carthage battle group will disperse to attack targets throughout the Asteroid Belt tomorrow. The $r Carthage itself will remain in reserve along with the corvettes $r Iolanthe and $r Deianira, as the $r Leander, $r  Legionary, $r Joketsu, $r Systema, $r Grissom, $r Antenor, $r Norfolk and $r Voronezh, along with multiple squadrons, devastate Belt mining, manufacturing, and processing platforms. Loss of these facilities will cut our shipyard output in half.

This presents us with a golden oppportunity."

10133, "Captain Simms, I have forwarded our tactical plan for the destruction of the $r GTD $r Carthage for your inspection. You will lead the Wargods' fighter elements in a critical role before the main attack.

This will be our riskiest operation yet, but it may destroy the GTVA's political will. This could be our Tet Offensive, our Siege of Yorktown or Battle of Algiers. 

Bear in mind that our source in the GTVA will probably be found and executed once it becomes clear the $r Carthage's battle plan was leaked. We have a responsibility to this unknown hero to pull this off.

As the Elders would say: for humanity. And for all the people we've lost. Let's do this.

We are going to jump in a small force and disable the $r Antenor. We will not destroy it. We will not present an overwhelming threat. We will not take out her comms system. We're just going to slip in and leave the $r Antenor helpless, using a small enough force that we don't seem much of a threat.

Then we're going to let the $r Antenor start crying for assistance."

Admiral Lopez of the $r Carthage, a woman who cares deeply for those under her command, will scramble a Jump Five team and a warship to assist the $r Antenor. They'll walk into our trap.

Since any good trick is worth pulling twice, we'll take out the Jump Five fighters and disable the response warship too. Neither warship should be destroyed$semicolon we want to take prisoners if we can."

10146, "Once the Jump Five warship has been added to our little ship graveyard, we'll use the capabilities of that special asset I mentioned: the $g Hanuman, an AWACS like the $g Anjaneya that saved us from Serkr Team back during the $r Agincourt extraction.

The $g Hanuman will jam outbound distress calls from the disabled GTVA warships - who will doubtless warn the $r Carthage away - and replace them with edited versions that beg Admiral Lopez for help.

The $g Hanuman will also be able to intercept incoming transmissions and even anticipate the arrival of hostile warships. It will allow us the forewarning we need to pull off the last stage of our plan."

10147, "Hanuman"

10148, "Faced with the capture or death of so many of her beloved subordinates, all pleading for her help, Admiral Lopez will bring the $r Carthage in to conduct a gallant rescue.

Unfortunately for her, the $g Katana and $g Altan $g Orde, the Jovian half of the Wargods' frigate forces, will be waiting in the wings to jump in and blow the hell out of the $r Carthage. If the $r Carthage withdraws using its tactical drive, the $g Hanuman will track its exit vector, and the $g Yangtze and $g Indus will pursue it.

One way or another, that ship is going down."

10149, "Katana"

10151, "This is a delicate and complex plan. 'Delicate' and 'complex' is perhaps not exactly our style, but we can do finesse when we must, can't we, Wargods?

Laporte! You'll be leading the initial disarm operation on the $r Antenor. I recommend Uriel gunships. Use your Archers and Paveways for precision strikes. Karen and Beta Wing will give you escort. I know you two trust each other.

Your strike package will use the callsign 'Ozone'. I'll roll in my own gunships once you've disarmed and disabled the Antenor. Be quick, or she'll slip away.

One last note. Saving the crews of $f Tatabanya and $f Sopron Stations is not a priority. I'm afraid those civilians are expendable."

10152, "We failed to set the bait for our trap. The Antenor never sent off a distress signal to lure warships in, and as a result, our whole plan disintegrated.

Look, I understand it was a high-pressure situation, but you had four frigates and an elite squadron counting on you to do your jobs. I can't accept that kind of failure, and neither can Admiral Netreba.

I expected better of you."

10153, "Use Scalpels, Paveways, and Archer fire to disable the Antenor. Once it is disabled, fall back, get hull repairs, and disarm it at your leisure.

Don't take out the ship's comm system until explicitly told to do so."

10154, "We failed to set the bait for our trap. The Norfolk never sent off a distress signal to lure the Carthage in, and as a result, our whole plan disintegrated.

Don't take out the ship's comm system until explicitly told to do so."

10156, "We're rolling! We'll hit the Carthage at Saturn in five minutes. If you want to alter your loadouts or ship choice, tell the deck crew right now.

10230, "We've lost the second processing platform! No pods on sensors...Tev butchers."

10231, "Wargod Six is in. Well, look at that, there's something left for us to do. Figured you'd have the Antenor wrapped up by now, Laporte."

10232, "No casualties, boss. We're green for stage two."

10233, "We've got casualties, but we're still on our feet. Let's push to stage two."

10234, "Right. Let's clean up the Antenor's turrets before I call in the Hanuman."

10235, "We lost a lot of civilians, Simms. It wasn't pretty. I wish we could've done something for them."

10236, "We stopped the Antenor from completing her objectives as well. The civilian platforms are still holding together."

10237, "Let's see if we can save these people."

10243, "What can you see, Hanuman?"

10244, "We've detected a large inbound transit. It must be the Carthage's Jump Five team. Stand by...ten seconds to hostile arrival!"

10245, "Remember, Wargods: destroy fighters, disable warships. We need our bait intact and screaming."

10246, "Here comes the Norfolk, Aeolus-class. Heavy fighter escort, but what the hell - let's hit 'em now. Laporte, disable flak guns and beam cannons."

10247, "Aw, hell, there's no way the Norfolk will get off a signal now. So much for our bait."

10248, "Wargods: abort, abort, abort. Jump home, we're done here."

10249, "Not bad, people, not bad. The Norfolk's now part of our little butterfly collection. Hanuman?"

10250, "She's sending a distress call. Stand by, we're recording it..."

10252, "We're cutting out the warning and rebroadcasting the distress call. If Admiral Lopez trusts her officers, she'll come running."

10253, "Okay, Wargods, let's clean up the escort. Watch yourselves."

10254, "<intercepted> Carthage, Carthage, do you read? Tell the Admiral we're past her help. Do NOT, under any circumstances, enter the area! Carthage, respond!"

10256, "No, we don't."

10262, "<intercepted> We're reading heavy communications jamming in the area. Targeting the Federation AWACS. We'll call in the Legionary and Leander once comms are clear."

10263, "Ey, that cuiter's huge!"

10264, "Hanuman, pass to the Katana: call is 'cataphract', say again, 'cataphract'. We're ready to rock."

10265, "Katana jump complete. Altan Orde, say your status."

10266, "Right with you, Captain Genady. Fire control has a clean lock on the Carthage."

10267, "Captain Simms, Lieutenant Ng'Mei, Sublieutenant Laporte - beautiful work. Keep close, and give us what cover you can. I want you to go home alive."

10268, "Admiral Lopez, we are the Federation Wargods. Your subspace drive is in its charge cycle and you are severely outgunned. More of our warships are on the way. Surrender now, and we will spare your crews."

10269, "The Antenor is using its subspace sensors to transmit a short-range message to the Carthage! Attempting to jam!"

10270, "<intercepted> Admiral, this is Captain Hamid! You're the real target! Get out now, or they'll rip you apart!"

10271, "<intercepted> I'm not leaving without you, Captain. Nor the Norfolk. I will not abandon my crews."

10272, "<intercepted> Admiral, please. We're expendable. You and your ship aren't. You have to withdraw."

10273, "<intercepted> I would sooner die than see my men in an Ubuntu camp. Stand by, Captain. We'll have the jamming cleared in five minutes."

10274, "Hanuman, shut that corvette up!"

10275, "<intercepted> Admiral! We are NOT WORTH IT! Get the hell out while you still can!"

10276, "<intercepted> God damn it."

10277, "<intercepted> Ops, signal all hands to brace for a crash jump. Helm, spool up the tactical drive. Captain Hamid - godspeed. I will be back for you, just as soon as I can."

10278, "She's jumping out! Katana, request mission update!"

10279, "Not a problem, Wargods. We tracked her exit vector - that experimental drive doesn't have the range to take her back to Jupiter."

10280, "Hanuman, pass those coordinates to the Indus and Yangtze. Wargods, jump home and dock ASAP - you're going after the Carthage. We'll join the attack as soon as our drives have cycled."

10281, "Let's go, let's go, let's go! She's not getting away from us, Wargods!"

10282, "Her crash jump trajectory will snag on Saturn's gravity well. She's trapped there until she recharges."

10284, "Wargod Six is in. Nice job with the Antenor, Laporte. You know how to make a lady feel welcome."

10285, "Heh, you should've heard her captain sputter. Impotent rage at its finest."

10286, "Sorry, I thought I'd leave you at least some reason to draw danger pay."

10287, "She's really bad at cards. Cut the chatter and give me a sitrep, ladies."

10288, "Hit the escort with your Slammers, then cut a 1500-meter arc around the Norfolk and come in from the stern!"

10289, "The Norfolk just lost reactor containment. Intel's going to be pissed that we didn't get those prisoners."

Gather round and listen close! The $r Carthage's jump trajectory was captured by Saturn's gravity well. We estimate she won't be able to jump again for at least twenty minutes. The $r Carthage's battle group has rallied to her position and set up a defensive screen.

The $g Indus and $g Yangzte are standing by to attack, and the $g Katana and $g Altan $g Orde will form a second strike package only minutes behind once their drives recharge. Admiral Netreba has placed the cruisers $g Kyoto and $g Insuperable at the Wargods' disposal. We're going in."

10302, "The $g Indus will take point. Captain Sorensen will jump in at long range along with the cruiser $g Insuperable and attempt to draw away some of the $r Carthage's escorts. The Tevs will doubtless sortie warships to drive the Indus away in case she's relaying coordinates to artillery or bombers, at which point the $g Yangtze will make a precision jump to join the battle and destroy these vessels.

Our plan from that point forward depends on Lopez's response. If she sorties her entire screen to engage, we will go for contingency CARTWHEEL: the $g Katana, $g Altan $g Orde and $g Kyoto will jump in on the opposite side of the battle and attack the $r Carthage's unguarded flank. If she holds her screen close, we will go with JACKKNIFE, and the second strike package will join up with the $g Indus and $g Yangtze and make a single concentrated thrust."

We will face down the entire surviving $r Carthage air wing, at least seven squadrons of fighters and bombers. The hangar deck has prepped Uriel gunships for heavy escort and fighter suppression. With Slammer missiles and Archer railguns, we will have the firepower we need to annihilate whole bomber wings and disarm warships at range. Stay close to the frigates, and work with their guns.

The $r Hood is still undergoing repairs from the thrashing we gave it, and our source says the $r Imperieuse is still in Delta Serpentis resupplying from the Blitz.

The Tevs have nothing to send to the $h Carthage's rescue. They have made a terrible mistake, and they are going to pay a terrible price. If we bring down the $h Carthage, we will send the Tevs reeling, and maybe even turn public opinion so far against the war that they sue for peace.

The Wargods are dead.

The informant. The source that gave us the Agincourt...he must have turned. Steele threw the Carthage out as bait, gave us a scent, and waited until we bit hard.

And all the while the Imperieuse was waiting, probably somewhere out in the Kuiper Belt, listening for the signal to strike. 

It must have been planned weeks in advance...months, maybe. When we thought she'd returned to Delta Serpentis, she'd really just gone to ground. 

Which means we never had a chance.

They all died for nothing."

10337, "There is only one chance left, Miss Laporte.

Only one way to avert the apocalypse.

You must be ready."

10338, "Good work, Wargods. With the destruction of the Carthage, the GTVA has retreated to Delta Serpentis and relieved Admiral Steele of command.

We have time to rebuild our armed forces, prepare for new threats, and hopefully negotiate an end to this war.

You are all heroes."

10339, "Now go read a book."

10340, "All rise. United Earth Federation General Court Martial session 1149, regarding the failed assault on the GTF Carthage and her battle group, final statement.

Sublieutenant Noemi Laporte, the tribunal has found you guilty of disobeying a direct order in combat situation, as well as fraternization with a superior officer in same chain of command. The tribunal also notes that your insubordination was critical in the chain of bad decisions that led to the loss of the UEF frigate Indus with all hands save you and Captain Simms. You are hereby formally reprimanded and this incident will be marked on your record. You will receive your transfer orders tomorrow morning. Any questions?

Captain Lorna Simms, the tribunal has found you guilty of fraternization with an immediate subordinate in a way that affected your judgement. As a result, your decision to stay with said subordinate when she refused to obey a direct order further affected Captain Sorenson's decision to stay and defend the crititically damaged frigate Yangtze. The tribunal notes that in normal circumstances these actions would only warrant official reprimand. However, due to the grave consequences of your actions, we find ourselves unable to let this pass with just that. Therefore... the tribunal hereby relieves you of all duties associated with Federation military as part of Bad Conduct Discharge protocols specified in the Federation Military Legislation. You will check in your equipment tomorrow morning at 0800 hours and receive your limited severance package. Any questions?

Very well. The tribunal concludes that the ultimate fault in loss of Indus lies with its commanding officer, Lloyd Sorensen, and that the behaviour of Sublieutenant Laporte and Captain Simms has apparently been part of lax command structure. Dismissed."

10341, "Your superior officers knew there was no way to rescue Yangtze. Your disobedience, while based on honourable intentions, resulted in the loss of Indus with all hands. Consider the consequences of your actions carefully and report to duty tomorrow morning at 0800 hours, when you will be handed your transferrence orders. Dismissed!"

10482, "This is Captain Lloyd Sorensen of the Federation frigate Indus. Your position is untenable. Stand down, remove the plasma cores from your weapons, and prepare to be boarded."

10483, "You and your escorts will stand down, remove the plasma cores from your weapons, and prepare to be boarded."

10484, "This is Admiral Lopez. I will never surrender to an illegitimate government. Take your best shot."

10485, "I know your military history, Admiral. Are you prepared to be the next Koth?"

10486, "Only if I lose, Captain. Only if I lose."

10487, "The Carthage has sortied its strike bombers. Form a perimeter and let them come to us."

10488, "Lopez has deployed two warships to attack, but she's holding the rest of her screen close. She must expect a flanking jump."

10490, "They're trying to swamp us. Watch the escort and stay close to the Indus."

10493, "Jump flash! Five heavies, two klicks, looks like a fighter sweep."

10494, "Take them out fast, then get on the bombers!"

10495, "Yangtze, this is Indus Actual. We have drawn the Leander and Legionary into position. You are go for deployment."

10496, "Indus, Yangtze Actual. We're on station and moving to bracket the Leander."

10501, "All hands, check your helmets. Port side gunnery, all rounds sabot, fire at will."

10502, "Maintain fire, Indus, that molybdenum's starting to crumble. Gunnery! Switch to hive on guns six and eight!"

10503, "Good shooting, Yangtze, that was beautiful work. The Legionary and Leander are out of the fight. Damage control, you've got two minutes."

10504, "The Carthage's screen is still holding. Captain Kyrematen wants to go with the secondary attack plan."

10509, "Heads up, Wargods. We have detected multiple squadrons launching from the Carthage."

10510, "That has to be what's left of their air wing. Steel yourselves, Wargods. This is their last stand. We take these bastards, and then we go for the kill."

10528, "Laporte, if it works, I might just let you!"

10529, "Wargods Delta, moving to disarm Carthage flank beams!"

10530, "Hah, did you see that! They just evaporated! Beautiful."

10531, "Laporte, sometimes I think you've got a little Martian blood in you."

10532, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, boss."

10533, "The Deianira has withdrawn! One less ship between us and the Carthage!"

10534, "The Iolanthe has abandoned its position and withdrawn!"

10535, "Okay, pilots, you saw the call. Prioritize the Deianira and Iolanthe for beam suppression. Delta will handle the Carthage. Break and engage!"

10536, "Come on, Wargods, I don't mean tomorrow! Archers up, hit those beams! Stand clear of flak!"

10537, "Thruster activity on the Iolanthe. She's rolling to bring undamaged beams online."

10538, "Katana, be advised, corvette Deianira is beginning a longitudinal roll to engage with fresh weapons."

10539, "Pilots, suppress those warships! We're bleeding armor fast!"

10540, "Reactor coolant pressure is flatlining! We need cover NOW, pilots!"

10541, "All hands, evacuate frame three. Blowthrough imminent. Pilots, where's your cover?"

10542, "We're suffering internal ammunition explosions! Disarm those beam weapons!"

10543, "Simms, the Captain wants a tighter screen. Bump it up a notch out there."

10544, "We can still get through this, Wargods. Just tighten up your cover!"

10545, "The Carthage's screen is in tatters! She's wide open!"

10546, "Captain Genady, Captain Kyrematen, Captain Albani: cease fire for the moment. Let's give her one more chance to surrender. "

10547, "This is it. This is the war, right here."

10548, "She's ours. Stand by to engage primary target."

10549, "Wait...stand by. That's impossible. There's a TAG beacon transmitting from our hull! We've been designated!"

10550, "Hanuman, you need to isolate and jam that signal!"

10551, "Jam that signal! JAM IT NOW!"

10552, "The Carthage is pinging the beacon! We're being painted! Fire control system in beam acquisition mode!"

10553, "The Hanuman's gone! Our beam jamming is offline!"

10554, "Gunnery, hit the Carthage! Hit her with everything you've got!"

10555, "Oh my God. Katana, we're reading a massive incoming subspace transit."

10556, "This is fucked up! This is severely fucked up!"

10557, "We need a status update, Indus!"

10558, "Incoming jump signature! Configuration...sweet Fortune."

10559, "No...impossible. The Imperieuse is in Delta Serpentis."

10560, "Captain Genady, get your people out! We have to go NOW!"

10561, "Negative, Indus, she's too close and she's already launched fighters. Someone will have to screen the retreat, or none of us are going home."

10562, "O Elders, protect and preserve your children, and guide us, even unto death..."

10563, "Gunnery, lock up the Imperieuse. Altan Orde, form up alongside and pass your firing solutions. Insuperable, Kyoto, torpedo her beam weapons. All hands, brace for - for hull breach."

10564, "They're all going to die. We have to help them. Simms, the forward beams -"

10565, "Indus! Request permission to assist in the attack on the Imperieuse! We could clear a path!"

10567, "No...we were so close..."

10571, "Wargods, we're pulling out while they buy us time! Form up or be left behind! We have to go NOW!"

10572, "She's tearing through us! We've got a magazine breach!"

10573, "Contact, contact! Tev bombers are warping in with fighter escort! Wargods, intercept and destroy while we charge our drives!"

10574, "We're in no shape for this! We're not getting out of here alive, Simms!"

10575, "We're the Wargods. They can't kill us."

10576, "Are you blind, Simms? We just left eight thousand Wargods to burn!"

10577, "You can bitch when you're dead! These ships are ours, and we're going to kill every bastard inside two klicks of them!"

10578, "I'm going to kill them all."

10579, "Yangtze, you've got a second bomber wing inbound with fighter escort. Designation Serpens."

10580, "We can do this, Indus. Just keep the fire tight. We'll make it out together."

10581, "Indus, we've got a problem. We're losing engine power."

10582, "What? Confirm that, Yangtze!"

10583, "Confirmed. Magnetic confinement failure on tokamaks 3 and 4. Maxim penetration really tore up Engineering."

10584, "Captain Sorensen requests a damage assessment. Can you still make the jump?"

10585, "Negative, Indus, we have lost jump capability. Captain Kyrematen sends her regrets."

10586, "Wargods, we need you to hold a little longer. We'll attempt to punch through the Tev jamming and call a repair transport for the Yangtze."

10587, "Negative, Indus, there's no time. Now get the hell out before it's too late. The Imperieuse is closing in fast."

10588, "Indus, we've got more bombers warping in! Three squadrons, at least!"

10589, "Godspeed to your crew, Captain Kyrematen. And to you. It's been - it's been an honor."

10590, "It was a good run, Lloyd. Helm! Turn us back towards the Imperieuse!"

10591, "Pilots, our drives are charged but we have no nav fix. We're making a crash jump. You must land at once! Repeat, return to the Indus immediately!"

10592, "Noemi, Lorna...we're staying with our ship. It's been a pleasure. I love you both."

10593, "Laporte, listen to me, damn it! Land your ship! I'm not losing you too! Land your bird!"

10594, "Hosh, you Tev bastards. Let's stack them up like cordwood, Karen."

10595, "Goodbye, old friend. I - I don't - god damn it."

Our crash jump was partially successful. We have evaded GTVA forces, but at a high price. Our jump trajectory took us into deep solar orbit. The shock of the jump destroyed our subspace drives and navigational systems, wrecked our hangar deck, and left our escape pods useless. Radiation shielding is badly compromised.

We are falling into the sun. With our drives crippled and our long-range communications down, we can only pray that someone detects our distress calls against the solar radiation and sends help.

Check your radiation badges every five minutes. We have less than two hours before we reach lethal intensities. Shortly thereafter, thermal pressure will exceed hull tolerances and the Indus will disintegrate.

God help us all.

Captain Lloyd Sorensen,
UEFg Indus"

10650, "For the attention of Sublieutenant Laporte,

Two, I assume you'll be done with postflight and medical by the time you've read this. I want to make a few things clear before I ever speak to you face-to-face again.

I will not discuss what happened back at Saturn. I will not talk about Karen, Olefumi, Levi or anyone else. I do not want to hear their names, or to see them written down, or to think about them. Not even once.

When I took you out on that training sortie a million years ago, you convinced me that the death of my pilots wasn't inevitable.

You were wrong.

Which brings me to my second point."

10651, "I will not watch another...another beloved friend die on my watch. I cannot allow that degree of attachment to compromise my command.

If we survive the next few hours, I am transferring you to the UED Eris. Your talents will be sorely needed as the war moves into its final stages, and I believe that Admiral Netreba can find a use for you. I will remain on the Indus to train up new pilots. Someone has to teach them how to die usefully.

You have a gift, Laporte. It frightens me almost as much as it impresses me. When I met you, you were an Ubuntu flower girl, but you killed like a psycho, like a dancer on angel dust.

Something is deeply wrong with you. It's why you're still alive. But you were a reliable wingman and a peerless warrior. And...you were a friend.

Godspeed, and check your six.

Sublieutenant, I am Al-Da'wa. Welcome to the Masyaf, home of the Fedayeen, the Federation's black ops contingency for extreme moral environments. We've been watching you with -


THIS MAN IS NOT WHAT HE SEEMS. HE IS MANY.


Are you with me? Sublieutenant Laporte, ATTEND! 

I know how hard it was to leave your captain. Our medics will do everything they can - for her and for the rest of your crew. Your casualties will be shuttled to the radiation trauma unit at Two Fleet Headquarters, and now that we have the Indus' drive back online, the spaceframe can be worked up. She may even fight again.

Can we say the same of you?

I am offering you a choice here. You can follow your captain's husk around until she decides whether to live or die. You will be a spectator in that fight, a waste of talent and potential.

Or you can follow the truth. A truth that I think you're well aware of by now. That's what your father always asked of you, isn't it? To pursue satya above all else.

You are not Ubuntu. You never were. You are a killer, like everyone else aboard this ship. And like so many of us you hear the whispers of the apocalypse rising from the ruins of this war. You may hear them the clearest of all of us.

If you want to waste yourself, by all means, follow your heart and back out of this room. But if you want to understand the truth, if you want to discover the true stakes of this conflict and shape the endgame of human existence - then you belong here.

We are the Fedayeen, last remnants of mankind's collective past, guardians of our collective future. This is the place where you can do the most good.

She sent you away for a reason, Laporte. Don't betray her last wish.

Falconer, take her to the Red Room. Initiate her."

I wrote this message before you decided to leave the Red Room. You will read it as you awake from the dreamscape, ready to fight.

The future is determined by its past. Know the state of the board and the rules of play, and you know what is yet to come. Predicting the actions of one woman is difficult, but not beyond our $f CASSANDRA mainframe, or beyond me.

This talent for simulation also tells us where and when to strike to alter the course of the war."

You will learn these things. They are secondary. You must master that which makes you $f Fedayeen: the capacity for violence, and the knowledge of when to use that violence. You must be ready to commit atrocities if necessary, and you must nonetheless understand that they are atrocities.

Nothing is true. All actions are permitted. But not all actions are correct. In every moment, you must find the shortest path to our ultimate goal. Ruthlessness, mercy, torture, succor, hatred, compassion: these are all tools, to be deployed as they are needed.

Our single overriding goal is the survival of mankind. The $f Council $f of $f Elders has made it clear to us that if the $f United $f Earth $f Federation is lost, that objective will fail. We intend to learn why."

10826, "Recent events left you critically damaged. You feel that our prospects in this war are also crippled. But we have a new asset.

We count amongst our ranks four $v Vasudan pilots, stranded in Sol after they helped destroy the $r Lucifer. Their appreciation of the $r Shivan threat led them to help found the $f Fedayeen.

Days before the Fall of Jupiter, they left Sol on the invitation of $v Emperor $v Khonsu $v II. Once they reached $v Aldebaran, these $f Fedayeen completed a pact that began with secret radio transmissions between Alpha Centauri and Earth thirty years ago. The $f Hammer $f of $f Light has come to our aid. We have access to a fanatically loyal intelligence network built deep into the fabric of the $r GTVA's military.

The $f Ainsarii is the latest descendant of the stealth fighter program initiated by Galactic Terran Intelligence before the Isolation. Produced on eccentric-orbit asteroid workshops, the $f Ainsarii combines the speed and agility that Fleet pilots demand with next-generation weapons systems such as the $f Sidhe molybdenum shrapnel weapon and the $f UX $f Accelerator light antimatter massdriver.

The Ainsarii carries a full stealth suite, from low-observability hull design to active countermeasures. Only $r Charybdis or $v Setekh AWACS, or the Terran $r Aurora fighter, can consistently detect it.

$f Ainsarii pilots must treat their large, vulnerable ship as the assassin it is: making quick, lightning attacks and retreating to repair and rearm."

10831, "$b Reference $b Continues

The $f Ainsarii serves as a testbed for several experimental technologies now entering broad deployment.

You will be authorized to carry two such flight systems.

The Cellular Ammunition Pack replaces one of your primary weapon mounts with fast-load packs for your internal secondary bays. Fire it to reload your secondaries.

The Repair System includes a reserve of coagulating polymer similar to that used by support ships. When selected, it will drain your ship's weapon energy and gradually scab over damaged armor, repairing your fighter."

Operational Impact Assessment

CASSANDRA projections and coordinator analysis of this outcome concur that this mission was a qualified success.

Hammer of Light sources within the Alliance confirm that the convoy's last received transmission was their contact report with Gaian Effort forces. Admiral Recamai is convinced that the Gaian Effort overwhelmed Bellwether 4.12, and he is furious with Admiral Steele for supplying faulty intelligence indicating that the Gefs were not a major threat.

Terran-Vasudan relations have been weak for several years now, and the two militaries are largely segregated and mutually distrustful. This should help to further drive a wedge between them.

Admiral Steele's SOC advisors are beyond HoL penetration, but all signs suggest that they have concluded that the Kostadin Cell is attempting to play both sides of the war for its mutual advantage. We believe that Special Operations Command will withdraw support of the Kostadin Cell and may even move against it in retaliation for this attack.

We destroyed the frigate Ridwan's Beta wing. This was an act of fratricide, a tragedy. But it also perplexed Vasudan investigators, who have correctly concluded that these Federation pilots died attempting to protect the convoy from Gef attack. Remember what we took from them, and what it earned.

He's got all those analysts and that mystery supercomputer CASSANDRA to back him up. Maybe I should just...not question. Accept that it's right, even if it feels wrong.

11028, "'Targets down?' We killed good Two Fleet pilots. Simms probably knew - probably knew - "

11029, "They died usefully. That's what soldiers are for. You do what you have to do, and you understand that it's terrible."

11030, "Nullify the remaining convoy elements before they jump away, pilots. "

11031, "<open channel> Look at you burn...this is the price of choosing the wrong side!"

11032, "Convoy objective neutralized. Eliminate those fighters before they can jump away."

11033, "We will sweep thermal and LIDAR for convoy survivors. With no time for SAR, we'll need to sanitize any witness."

11034, "Have you mastered your bloodlust, Laporte, or has it mastered you?"

11035, "Falcata, Midwinter 5-2, we are under heavy fire from convoy elements. Provide suppression. 5-2 clear."

11036, "No datalink, no beacon. Scratch Midwinter 5-2."

11037, "We are detecting an intermittent signal near the convoy wreckage. Frequency and pattern match Two Fleet suit distress beacons. It must be one of the Ridwan pilots."

11038, "Midwinter, clear the area immediately. Laporte, your wing may return to the Masyaf or linger and observe the aftermath. Keep your weapons safe and stay far from any new arrivals."

11039, "<intercepted> They're targeting the marine transports! We cannot hold them!"

11040, "Copy, target is primed. Going in hot."

11041, "Breaking to engage infected Anuket!"

11042, "This should make a pretty good boom."

11043, "That miner's still dry. Your call, Laporte."

11044, "They're going to feel this when it goes off."

11045, "Guns, guns, guns!"

11046, "Flying formation with a fusion bomb earns you a quick and stupid death."

11047, "You want me to waste a perfectly good miner?"

11048, "This should do some organic damage."

11049, "Live miner, locked up. Stand by."

11050, "Tally that miner. Give me a few."

11051, "Guess you don't want that one?"

11052, "Can you handle this, Laporte? If not, someone else will step up. We don't have time to think."

11053, "Wait. Let's take a moment to set him at peace."

11054, "What can we tell him that could possibly make this right?"

11055, "The truth."

11056, "Stand easy, pilot. We'll have you out of here in a moment. Your wingmen are waiting for you."

11057, "Identify yourselves immediately! You're not going to get away with this!"

11058, "You stumbled into a black op. You're something of an ironic hero, pilot. The debris from your fighter is going to convince the Vasudans that we died trying to save them. You might take them out of the war."

11059, "I'll believe it when I'm back on the Ridwan. Where's your SAR bird? Are the boss and Pox okay?"

11060, "They're on the way. Laporte, you want to give this fine soldier an ETA?"

11061, "Sorry, Laporte, but we don't have time to dawdle. Al-Da'wa will be disappointed in your hesitation. Let's move out."

11062, "Rest in peace, little rat. Let's move."

11063, "Warship hull attack confirmed."

11064, "I'll handle the cruiser for you, Laporte."

11065, "Engaging warship now!"

11066, "Do I get to paint a thousand Vasudans on my ship?"

11067, "I thought they decommissioned these things to use as mass graves?"

11068, "A cruiser can do everything a wing of fighters can, and risk two hundred and fifty times as many crew! What's not to love?"

11069, "Plotting my attack."

11070, "I hate beams. I hate pulse guns. I hate cruisers."

11071, "Setting up for anti-warship run. Stand by."

11072, "Engaging Vasudan fighters!"

11073, "Padlocking that Serapis."

11074, "Is that a fighter or a stunt plane?"

11075, "At least their new Anubis has a thin target profile."

11076, "Bandit in my sights."

11077, "Engaging convoy elements!"

11078, "Ripping up the haulers. Good effect-per-munition ratio, huh?"

11079, "Tackling soft targets."

11080, "Laporte, we're too close to the AWACS. Detection risk is critical!"

11081, "Fair enough, Laporte. Dead is dead, whether or not we set his mind at ease first. Let's go."

11082, "Sorry it had to be like this."

11083, "Rolling in hot on friendlies. I don't get paid enough for this."

11084, "A target is a target. Going loud."

11085, "Setting up to engage the cruiser. Stand by."

11086, "Warship target confirmed. Suppress those turrets."

11087, "Midwinter 5-2 is engaging the Tabia."

11088, "Fire mission on convoy elements confirmed. Stand by."

11089, "An enemy vessel has jumped clear of the engagement zone. All Fedayeen, break off the op and pull out. We have failed."

11090, "God DAMN it!"

11091, "If you can't do this, Laporte, then we will. But we need to do the job before they jump home."

11092, "They had to come looking, didn't they? They just had to. Laporte, if you can't stomach this, then let us take care of it."

11093, "I hate this part of the job. Laporte, if you don't want to pull the trigger, then let us do it. Just be quick, before they jump clear."

11094, "Area clear. No survivors. We are trawling and scrambling the black boxes with a Gef-make EMP effector."

11095, "Chi 1 has purged its systems."

11096, "Storage safeties back online on Chi 2."

11097, "Chi 3's crew has overcome the viral strike!"

11098, "Chi 4 has completed viral immunity measures."

11099, "Do you like to bask in the afterglow, Laporte?"

11100, "I want to confirm that our ruse worked, Falconer. Nothing more."

11101, "We know what you are, Laporte. You don't need to justify yourself here. We're all the same way."

11102, "I'm glad to be flying again. I...I did start itching to get back to this. I want payback."

11103, "But like your Captain told you, Laporte, the high always passes. We're addicts, aren't we? All of us."

11104, "How do you know she said that? What don't you people know?"

11105, "We know everything you've ever said into a COM, and more. We know who you are, who you love, and what you fear."

11106, "We know everything you've ever said into a COM, and more. Fedayeen don't keep secrets - except when the mission requires it."

11107, "All right, no secrets: Al-Da'wa said we weren't human any more. What did he mean?"

11108, "There's a saying...we're a spear without a hand. A gun that aims itself."

11109, "We're the castoffs of Ubuntu. Gathered to do the things that Ubuntu can't do and can't know."

11110, "Posthuman? Subhuman? I don't know. Listen: we're a gang of ruthless motherfuckers, liberated from thousands of years of social programming to do whatever's necessary for human survival."

11111, "But there's a code. We do what is necessary, but we don't pretend what we do is right. We're monsters and we know it. And some day we won't be necessary."

11112, "That's cheery as a funeral...heads up, flash contact! Hostiles inbound!"

11113, "Hey, Laporte. Are you okay? Are you staying to admire your work, or to atone for it?"

11114, "I want to see how well our ruse goes down, Vidaura. I'm not in this for thrills."

11115, "And yet you are thrilled. You can't help it. We're all the same way, Laporte...you don't have to hide it here."

11116, "We're...a failsafe for Ubuntu. We exist to do things so horrible that merely contemplating them would destroy Ubuntu society."

11117, "But we don't pretend we're good people. We want to be obsolete, Laporte. We want to be unnecessary and extinct."

11118, "Hey, V. I think Laporte wants to stay a while and admire her work."

11119, "Button it, Kovacs. We're here effect assessment. I don't take any pleasure in this."

11120, "I can hear your shame, Laporte...but it's okay to enjoy the rush. We all get that high. It's who we are."

11121, "And now you've got it. But like your Captain told you, Laporte, the high always passes, doesn't it?"

11122, "We know everything you've ever said into a COM, Laporte. We don't keep secrets. Except when we have to."

11123, "We're a self-operating, self-targeting, totally amoral contingency for the Elders."

11124, "People say that we're inhuman monsters. They're right. We use any means to achieve our ends...and I mean ANY means. Because our end is human survival."

11125, "Heartrate at 180...endorphins way up. I never get tired of this rush. Bird, Virginia, you feeling it too?"

11126, "You know what, Kovacs, I'm not sure we should be savoring 'the rush' after killing a few thousand people."

11127, "Oh, hell, something wasted the convoy. Total loss, not even any suit beacons. Fuck! I had two squadmates rotating back in!"

11128, "This is Kappa wing of the 490th Squadron, GVD Shepseskaf. What happened to the convoy, Terrans?"

11129, "You tell me, pilot! We were scrambled as soon as Admiral Recamai deigned to relay the convoy's contact report to Artemis Station! I guess he was a little slow!"

11130, "This is impossible. We received a contact report and datalink telemetry indicating a small Gaian Effort attack before all transmissions ceased. They could not have overcome the convoy alone!"

11131, "All units, this is Alpha wing of the 13th Eidolon, Special Operations Command. Clear the area. We are assuming command of the loss investigation by order of CINCSOL, Admiral Steele."

11132, "Very well. But this tragedy will be answered for...no matter who is responsible. We were given guarantees of safety. They have been abrogated!"

11133, "I'm reading no survivors. Whoever did this was thorough. Covered his tracks."

11134, "I've got some Federation fighter wreckage here. Could this have been a Buntu strike op? It fits the old Wargods profile."

11135, "Negative on that. I trawled the black boxes in the debris. These Fed fighters were trying to assist the convoy. Something scrambled the boxes pretty bad...looks like a directed EMP pulse. I'm thinking Gefs."

11136, "Forensics package is reading damage from some very sophisticated weapons...not normal Gef issue. But I've definitely got drive residue from Scimitars here."

11137, "You think it was the Kostadin Gefs? Maybe they're still taking weapon handouts from Federation Intelligence."

11138, "MacDuff's a bigger lunatic than Bosch. If he thinks he can destroy both sides by playing the middle, he'll do it. Commander, I think Kostadin's running a double-cross."

11139, "You don't get paid to think, pilots. The strategic utility of Kostadin Cell is up to the Admiral. Continue your sweep, Eidolons."

11140, "I've seen enough. Let's scram before they identify us."

11141, "Fool! You have been detected! Your negligence has made this victory into a crushing defeat!"

11142, "Four minutes to convoy jump. Make sure you're leveraging the gunboat and your wingmen, Falcata 1."

11143, "Drive ready! Jumping clear!"

11144, "Someone's got to see this! Jumping home!"

11145, "I'm out! Jumping to the Ridwan!"

11146, "Picking my targets now."

11147, "They're all mine!"

11148, "Engaging at will. Call me if you need me."

11149, "If revenge helps you get the job done, then take your revenge. But don't get lost in it."

11150, "Be careful, Laporte. Master your bloodlust before it masters you. You can't kill for the wrong reasons."

11151, "Uh-huh. Going loud."

11152, "I am the last thing they'll never see."

11153, "Thanks, Laporte! Engaging all."

11155, "<intercepted> All Bellwether elements, engage at will. Tabia, relay immediate to the Shepseskaf: we are under attack by Kostadin Cell!"

11156, "One of the Ridwan Beta fighters has jumped away. The sensor records on that ship will reveal Fedayeen involvement in this attack, that information will reach the Vasudans, and this war is over. We've failed."

11157, "I couldn't do it. I'll never do it."

11158, "Heads up, operators. The convoy is scattering. Check your directives list for the targeting hotkey."

11159, "They're going to be scattered over a forty-klick volume. Let's pick up the pace before they get too far, Falcata."

11160, "Once they leave formation they're easy pickings. Let's get on it, Fedayeen."

Previous simulations never produced the name because it was on an exclusion list. People who were implicitly trusted.

Looking back, it's obvious. Who was supposed to go on the $v Shepseskaf mission, but bowed out? Who was close to $f Admiral $f Netreba, and thus to Two Fleet planning data?

The traitor is an Elder. Svetlana Henriksson."

Thorn's message went out to you two hours ago. I apologize for delaying it, but the information had to remain compartmentalized until we could capture Henriksson.

She was on Luna as of one hour ago. Unfortunately, our attempt to secure her failed. An $h SOC unit captured local transit and extracted her.

Our tails report that she was moved to the corvette $h Fortitude for medical treatment, but the $r Diomedes-class corvette evaded them with a series of jumps.

Henriksson possesses secrets even I do not, including the details of the $f Elders' end-state contingency for this war.

I have unilaterally authorized her termination."

11205, "$b Message $b Continues

Henriksson is a physicist and statesman of considerable repute. Her personal records indicate that she was motivated by a desire to end this war rapidly and decisively. She saw the $r Alliance as the inevitable victors.

She expresses regret for the loss of $f Elder $f Taudigani, but contends that something termed 'Shambhala' is 'a reprehensible gamble with the lives of billions and possible extinction'.

If she reaches Artemis Station, the sacrifices we have made to enact the Elders' plan will be rendered meaningless.

Henriksson is badly injured. She goes directly to $r GTD $r Atreus for debriefing. $r Fortitude jumps in at a safe range, since $r Artemis is a high-traffic area, and deploys transports under heavy guard. Transports move faster than the corvette.

You performed well in a hazardous environment under tremendous pressure, and in doing so, lived up to the expectations placed on the most reliable of operators. I am pleased.

Your diligent execution of the mission is to be commended. You executed the attack with textbook precision.

Admiral Steele's reaction to the loss of such a critical asset has been outwardly restrained. But make no mistake: there is a shadow war underway in the halls of power on both sides of this war.

11370, "Your Council is clear-sighted, Elder Henriksson. If only they'd all made your choice."

11371, "The project is called Shambhala. It began twenty years ago, but the final breakthroughs were not made until the 14th Battlegroup defectors brought their expertise to bear."

11372, "Is it a weapon? A warship? A beam-armed battle group? I need specifics."

11373, "Hahaha! How typical, Admiral. What good would a weapon have done us? You must understand that Shambhala is an answer to a problem that predates this war by decades."

11374, "Unlike you, Elder, I cannot grasp an entire culture with a few months' study. Make yourself plain."

11375, "Shambhala is the Elders' plan to end the war without the exercise of military power. It preserves the principles of Ubuntu while satisfying the messy practical need for victory."

11376, "Fascinating, Elder Henriksson. I'm afraid I have to cut this interview short$semicolon my own duties call. My marines will meet you on the deck."

11386, "Appreciated, Artemis. We hear they're all on edge after something big that went down a few days ago. Do you know anything about that?"

11387, "Only rumors, Humpback. They sound bad. There's one word that keeps coming up again and again."

11388, "What word is that, Artemis Control?"

11389, "Some kind of black ops unit called the Fedayeen. We don't know much else."

Current estimate:

11542, "I have declared this operation priority BANE. I will brief you personally. Security - leave us."

11543, "Four days ago, GTVA $r Special $r Operations $r Command began punitive attacks on the Gaian Effort $r Kostadin $r Cell. We successfully framed $r Kostadin for the destruction of the $v Bellwether convoy.

Other, more moderate Gef cells have cut ties. $r Kostadin, once the most powerful Effort faction, now faces total collapse. Surviving $r Kostadin ships have withdrawn to their home habitat as the $r SOC purge continues."

11544, "Gef Habitat"

11545, "Special Operations Command"

11546, "$r Kostadin's charismatic leader, the $r Reverend $r Iain $r MacDuff, is cornered. He is a hardline fanatic, responsible for the genesis of the $r Gaian $r Effort fringe society. As other cells splintered away, he kept $r Kostadin loyal to his radical ecoterrorist agenda.

MacDuff has ordered his followers to carry out his dream: force humanity to abandon planetbound life and become Cometary Man."

11547, "Iain MacDuff"

11548, "When my agents in $r Kostadin delivered their report, we thought they had succumbed to hysteria. But the intelligence has been verified. $r Kostadin has been collecting subspace drive components since before the $f Nauticus incident. 

$r MacDuff's intentions are far more terrifying than we had believed.
 
Within six hours, the Kostadin $h core $h habitat will, by means unknown, ram itself into the surface of $r Terra at velocities sufficient to cause a $r planetary $r extinction $r event. Earth's biosphere will be reborn in fire."

11549, "Ideally, we would strike the habitat with the full force of our $f Fleet. Unfortunately, precise jumps so far from the Sun require hours to safely plot. Worse, the Gefs have seeded the area with gravity generators to hamper attackers. 

Using data from our spies, CASSANDRA has identified a safe passage, but only small craft will be able to plot a survivable jump in time. I am deploying a strike force to capture the core habitat, kill the defenders, and abort whatever plan $r MacDuff has initiated. 

We believe the habitat will attempt to make a subspace jump. By the time you reach the mission area, there will be less than ten minutes left to abort the process."

11550, "Fedayeen"

11551, "Federation Fleet"

11552, "The habitat is built out of a rocky Oort Cloud object. Hundreds of thousands of $r Gef noncombatants make their homes aboard. If we massacre these civilians, we will anger other $r Gef cells, but this is a secondary concern.

Our plan is to board the habitat and abort the jump. When you believe the approach is safe, call in the $f Andex with a team of boarding specialists, and escort it in to dock.

Unless you have another option, the $r primary $r command $r habitat must not be destroyed. We need to get our specialists into this habitat to deactivate the jump sequence."

11553, "Andex"

11554, "Boarding the habitat will be risky, especially in the face of heavy Gef opposition. If a way could be found to destroy the jump system directly, this would be an acceptable alternative tactic. Unfortunately, we have no intelligence on the system.

If you arrive on the scene and find the Gef defenses too heavy for a boarding, you must find another way to destroy the habitat. Data gathered from Kostadin captives suggests a physical passage into the interior exists.

The choice between capture and destruction will be yours. The transport will jump in on your signal."

11555, "A matter of personal interest to you, Operator. The habitat is guarded by many of the surviving military forces of the Kostadin Cell. A young man named $r Ivan $r Gwilym will lead the fighter corps. His father $r Sergei $r Gwilym worked closely with $r Steele and is, as I understand it, on your list.

The $r Reverend $r MacDuff's personal warship, named after - and, some say, built around - his late beloved wife, is holding station near the habitat. This man is the tyrant who controls the $r Kostadin cult. If possible, eliminate him.

The Gef pilots you spared during the Bellwether attack have warned their comrades of our ruthlessness, leading Kostadin to station more warships at the habitat. Analyst Thorn's personality models suggest that there will be no retreat. Expect the defenders to fight to the death. "

11556, "Ivan Gwilym"

11557, "A matter of personal interest to you, Operator. The habitat is guarded by many of the surviving military forces of the Kostadin Cell.

Analyst Thorn's personality models suggest that there will be no retreat. Expect the defenders to fight to the death."

11558, "We have granted you command of the $f UEC $f Vindicator, a heavily modified Custos patrol cruiser. The $f Vindicator contains state-of-the-art engine and weapons systems, and mounts a prototype generator capable of powering a cruiser-sized shield bubble. She is a Fedayeen ship through and through. Her like has never been seen in the GTVA nor the Federation.

Helm the $f Vindicator as you would a fighter. Your shield management keys will cycle through a list of your $f turrets. Use up and down to select turret banks, and left and right to set the $f mode. 'Track' follows your current target. 'Lock' follows a target you can designate with the $f mouse button. $f Auto engages targets automatically, including incoming warheads."

11559, "Vindicator"

11560, "The $f Vindicator has several abilities, which you can select with the 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys.

1 is a shield boost for use in intense combat. 2 is a damage control system to repair your hull. It takes a long time to power up. 3 is a countermeasure system that will decoy incoming missiles. 4 is a power boost to your MHD thrusters that will grant you unlimited afterburners.

The Vindicator is the largest warship that can succesfully plot the transit to the Kostadin core habitat in time. Once you have successfully negotiated the passage and signaled, the Andex marine transport will attempt to follow your course."

11561, "Your mission was an abject failure. 

The Gaian Effort habitat exited subspace in low Earth orbit. The jump shock sheared the habitat into fragments, but the high relative velocity of the debris slammed 90% of the resulting mass into Earth's southern hemisphere. Interception was impossible.

We now face a cataclysm nearly comparable to the loss of Vasuda Prime.

Damage reports are catastrophic. Tsunamis are still propagating across the globe. CASSANDRA projects final casualties in the billions and global nuclear winter.

This operation should have been a triviality, given the resources at your disposal. You had every motivation to succeed and you were well aware of the cost of failure.

I have nothing more to say. You acted, and these are the results. I cannot protect you from the condemnation of history."

11562, "The easiest way to stop the habitat from jumping is to enter its interior, destroy the reactor, and flee. Use the MHD thruster ability, #4 on the panel, to boost your speed. 

If you want to take the habitat intact and save the innocents aboard, you will need to defeat the Morena MacDuff and both Gwilyms. If you can't take them all out in time, destroy the sentry guns around the command habitat, then call in the Andex and keep the Gefs occupied while it docks."

11563, "Don't look so surprised, Operator. I am still Al-Da'wa. 

You prevented a planetary extinction event and nullified the Kostadin Cell as a meaningful strategic threat. The collateral damage included the lives of every citizen of MacDuff's cult-state. 

Given the alternative, these losses are acceptable, but they are, nonetheless, tragic. We committed mass murder today. Reflect on that, even as you understand its necessity.

Ships from the Gaian Effort Greenfly Cell arrived on the scene shortly after your departure. We suspect that blame for Kostadin's extermination will lead to a freeze in relations with the less radical Effort cells. A task force is already working on a projection of the consequences.

I understand that the members of your wing are waiting to congratulate you on your success. And may I offer my own personal compliments, Operator. Your willingness to make a hard choice today means you have a future in command."

11564, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

Mass murder. What do I say to that?

I guess I say: they had it coming.

One more down."

11565, "Don't look so surprised, Operator. I am still Al-Da'wa. 

You prevented a planetary extinction event and nullified the Kostadin Cell as a meaningful strategic threat. Capturing the habitat intact means that our analysts will be able to plunder Gef databases for intelligence - and possibly prove to the Vasudans that Steele was working with the Kostadin cell.

We do not have the manpower to seize Kostadin Habitat, so I have contacted the Gef Greenfly Cell, a moderate transhumanist element, to assume control in exchange for concessions. This relationship may prove of use in the near future. 
Greenfly was impressed by the care we took to avoid casualties aboard Kostadin, which is known as a cult-like prison state. We may some day be hailed as liberators. It is not often that we maintain the moral high ground in our work, Operator.

I understand that the members of your wing are waiting to congratulate you on your success. And may I offer my own personal compliments, Operator. Your willingness to make a hard choice today means you have a future in command."

11566, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

That was the tensest damn mission I think I've ever flown.

One more down."

11567, "The Reverend MacDuff escaped the destruction of his habitat. I am pleased to report, however, that Tev SOC operatives killed him less than thirty minutes later. You may remove that name from your list."

11568, "We also have intelligence that Sergei Gwilym, Kostadin's military leader, survived the engagement. This man was a hardline zealot, and it is unlikely he will ever find a power base again."

11569, "The loss of the boarding team is most regrettable. Those operatives were veterans of ten years of high-risk boarding operation, drawn from Sol's best. They may have been the finest close-quarters combatants humanity has ever seen. But they would be glad to know that you ultimately accomplished the mission."

11728, "We are on target. Good jump. We have ten minutes to doomsday. You're live on helm, Laporte - take it away."

11730, "Vampire, vampire, MacDuff's gone weapons free! Let's dance!"

11731, "Laporte, it's Kovacs. I have options for you. MacDuff and the Gef defenses have to be suppressed before we board the habitat. But if that's too slow, we can enter the habitat via one of those tunnels. Might find a reactor inside."

11732, "The first jacket just gave way! Laporte, can we risk a standing fight?"

11733, "Laporte, we MUST break off and repair! If we lose this ship we lose Earth! I WILL use force if necessary!"

11734, "I'm landing good hits on the Morena. Get me more shots, I'll get you more holes."

11735, "Laporte, Kovacs. I'm detecting a massive radiation source inside the asteroid. Attempting to identify."

11736, "Laporte, listen to me: if blowing up that gate means killing every innocent Gef here, it's still worth it. We have to save Earth. Understand?"

11737, "Laporte, be advised, when that reactor complex detonates it's going to go off like a meson bomb. Have you ever seen a meson bomb? Never mind. It'll go off like Capella."

11738, "Wildcat reactor event underway! Fly like hell, Laporte!"

11739, "I've mapped the asteroid. Marking the best exit on your escort list. Get in position before you kill the reactor - I don't want to die this far from the sun."

11741, "Laporte, permission to kill the reactor and get us out of here? Cults give me the creeps. Set missiles to track the reactor hull."

11742, "Massive radiation event...no survivors aboard the asteroid habitats. Those poor people. At least they didn't suffer."

11743, "Aquarius wing is giving us hell! Arm anti-fighter missiles, maneuver clear, and get some flares out!"

You're right about Lopez. She doesn't think like Steele. Her people are more than assets to her. It's a weakness that's been exploited before, and you're right - she's not one to fall into the same trap twice.

But she lost people at Saturn. Steele spent them to kill your Wargods. She has to have doubts. Quietly, maybe...but those are the best kind. She's a professional. It'll take a lot to make her disobey an order. But in the right circumstances, she could be what we need.

I can't discuss my operational plans here, but the Fedayeen are critical to them. I don't trust the Fedayeen. I trust you. Thus, the promotion. I've asked that you be placed in command of any joint ops in the near future.

Despite my inquiries, I have no information on the status of Captain Lorna Simms - like somebody's blocking me. I appreciate your interest. What happened to the Wargods was a damn shame. 

I've followed your progress in the war. You were a leadership element at key moments. I can find a use for you - I'm breveting you to the rank of Captain in Third Fleet. Keep yourself intact.

FROM: Analyst Thorn

This is a SHATTERPOINT alert. CASSANDRA projections based on recent recon data have detected an opportunity for high-impact direct action within the next 48 hours.

The $r GTVA is transferring key assets and defenses away from their $r Neptune fortifications in order to concentrate strength at $r Jupiter. Intercepted directive BALTIC suggests their intent is to avoid losses due to strategic overextension.

$r Steele's forces are off balance. This leaves $r Neptune vulnerable."

11825, "$b Continues

Conclusions.

1. We determine that $r Admiral $r Steele would rather lose $r Neptune than lose ships defending it. Neptune is no longer a key $r GTVA position.

2. Although Neptune's defenses are now reduced, it would require a Fleet-strength assault to capture or destroy the installation.

Pursuant to Conclusion 2, we have activated our assets in $f Third $f Fleet in preparation for a joint operation. $f Admiral $f Calder has requested Operator Laporte as his tactical liason."

11826, "$b Continues

In order to augment your tactical abilities in large-scale engagements, we have authorized you to equip a new flight system developed in UEF workshops.

The Enhanced Reactive Armor package will replace your axial primary mount with a battery system and mount a network of conformal plasma jets across your ship. Rather than serving as thrusters, these jets attempt to degrade the shot packaging of incoming plasma weapons and the terminal ballistics of missiles and other projectile weapons. Your ship's survivability will be enhanced. No power drain or activation is required."

11842, "$r Admiral $r Steele will not commit forces to save the $r Carthage. His plans are razor-calibrated. He would rather sacrifice an aging destroyer than escalate the fight.

He fears escalation more than loss of $r Carthage. If he commits forces at Neptune, First or Second Fleet commit elsewhere in response, and Steele faces a decisive battle. He does not want that to happen at a time and place of our choosing. He chooses the certainty of losing a destroyer over the slight chance of losing the war.

Your capture of the GTD Carthage is a critical victory, but not the game-changer it would have been a month ago.

We expect the GTD Vengeance or GTD Phoenicia to replace the Carthage in the Sol Theater shortly. In the meantime, we face the challenge of interning ten thousand GTVA prisoners in humane conditions.

Admiral Steele appears prepared for the loss of the Carthage, but sources suggest he is furious at Lopez's failure to destroy Neptune HQ or pull her own flagship clear.

12141, "Neptune HQ, I know you're reading this. You saw what I did to the Carthage. Surrender immediately, or you're next."

12142, "<intercepted> Artemis Control, this is Neptune Actual. I am enacting General Order Seventeen. It's been an honor. Detonation in three, two, one..."

12143, "Don't be naive. Your scuttle charges are irreparably damaged - our people saw to that. Now you've got a choice: you can surrender before I send in three thousand marines, or after."

12144, "Our agents have sabotaged your self-destruct charges. Now that your position's clear, I'm going to give you fifteen seconds to surrender before I ram three battalions of marines down your throat."

12145, "If you want this station, come and get it. Neptune Actual, clear."

12146, "Acknowledged, Neptune Actual, and understood. Toutatis Actual clear. "

12147, "Then I'll see you in hell, you pig-headed son of a bitch."

12148, "I know this kind of man. He'll never budge. Ops, sortie the Grimler teams to suppress her turrets, then bring in the marines. Comms, tell the marines they're a go...and have them warm up the gas."

12149, "Toutatis, the station will not surrender. I need a Grimler team to keep her turrets suppressed. After that it's up to the marines. Tell them to use gas. These Tevs had their chance for a clean out, and they missed it.
"

12150, "This is why I hate heroes."

12151, "Oh, bad move. Very bad move."

12152, "*sigh* And so we get our daily dose of atrocity."

12153, "We'll take care of the bloody business on that station. Seeing you at work again was an unexpected pleasure, Brevet-Captain Laporte. I'd like to repeat this engagement in the future."

12154, "Agreed, Admiral. I have a list I could use your help on. But for now, I'm gone. I don't want to watch this place turn into an abattoir. Fedayeen, on me!"

12155, "Steady, Laporte. Like I always say, these soldiers on that station had a choice. That's more than most of us get."

12156, "Don't go soft on me, Laporte. Seven thousand combatants gassed is nothing compared to what you might have to do some day."

12157, "The gas is quick...most of them won't feel anything."

12158, "Tell them the truth, Laporte. Tell them what you've become"

12159, "I'm not pulling us out because I'm afraid of what's about to happen."

12160, "It's because you're not afraid at all."

12161, "I get it. Go ahead, say it."

12162, "You're numb, aren't you?"

12163, "The people on that station, on the Carthage...they're all just ants to me. I feel nothing."

12164, "Let's go, Fedayeen. There's more work to be done before we rest."

12165, "I can walk the line. I wanted to kill the Carthage, but it wasn't necessary. I'm in control."

12166, "The Carthage was just the start. They're going to pay."

12169, "We've secured a beachhead and established a software incursion. Environmental controls are ours. Stallion Four-One is moving to link up with Hammer of Light survivors. Give us a few hours - this sweep is going to take time. Hellbender Six out."

12170, "Corvette viral strike...complete."

12171, "Virus in! Breaking clear!"

12172, "Laporte, we should get some distance and play this smart. Interceptors for the escort, then heavy strike for the warships."

12173, "Here's another angle: let's get in right under her belly and use everything we've got. We need shock."

12174, "Nailed those Auroras."

12175, "Aurora threat...minimized."

12176, "No more Auroras. We've got a lot more freedom now."

12177, "All units, Laporte, general advisory: stay the hell away from Neptune HQ. Those pulse cannons will rip you up."

12178, "This is Rear Admiral Anita Lopez. My imperative here is the survival and fair treatment of my crews. To which Federation officer do I owe my thanks?"

12179, "This is Captain Noemi Laporte, Indus Wargods. My unit was ordered to capture or destroy your ship. I'm completing that mission."

12180, "Save your bravado, Captain. My officers are currently destroying sensitive intelligence and material aboard this ship. I want guarantees that there will be no reprisals."

12181, "No guarantees, Lopez. You forfeited everything when you disobeyed Steele. No one's going to stand up for you - not him and certainly not Calder. As for Neptune HQ....we'll handle them. Laporte clear."

12182, "Gunboat elements arrived in knife range! Rolling ECM and moving for torpedo runs!"

12183, "Tau gunboats, on station for torpedo attack on Carthage and screen elements. Rolling ECM."

12184, "We're here, Laporte. In close."

12185, "Fedayeen ready. Use us with care, Laporte."

12186, "Chi Strike on station, danger close! Give us targets!"

12187, "Yeah, Chi Strike on station. You've got four Durgas ready to rock."

12188, "Oh FUCK me, we're right on top of her! Where's our target call?"

12189, "Phi Strike is set for inbound. Antimatter by the ton."

12190, "Precision strike! We are WAY too close! Orders, now!"

12191, "Precision strike, 979th Arc, on standby."

12192, "Gunships in, going loud now now now."

12193, "Ascendant Justice gunships, ready for targets."

12194, "Saturation gunships, in and under two klicks! Ripple what you've got, ladies!"

12196, "571 intercept is in and right under their guns! Going for the bandits!"

12197, "571 Squadron interceptors in and off the leash. Banzai their screen!"

12198, "Second warning, Laporte, you've got an active AWACS under twenty seven hundred."

12199, "You're still dancing right under their eyes, Laporte. You better not fuck up."

12200, "AWACS still active at two seven zero zero."

12201, "Play with fire and you're gonna get burned. AWACS still live inside two point seven."

12202, "Noemi, stay on your toes...AWACS watching, too close for comfort."

12203, "One last AWACS warning for you. Don't slip."

12204, "No! NO! She's not getting away again! I don't believe this!"

12205, "You are profoundly screwed, Laporte."

12206, "Commander on the scene, Laporte...Al-Da'wa won't be pleased."

12207, "Noemi, I'm so sorry."

12208, "We need to blind them. I say go for the AWACS and the three Auroras first."

12209, "Before we tackle anything else, we have an obligation to get the Serenity clear."

12210, "Third option. If we wreck those Mjolnirs, we'll gain the upper hand in the artillery duel."

12211, "I can't afford any damage to this ship, Laporte. Kill those guns. Calder out."

12212, "Laporte, Calder, you damn well better get those guns offline before I run out of ablatives."

12213, "God damn it, Laporte, I'm not going to watch my flagship get shot to pieces by a flock of overgrown sentry guns. Kill them NOW. Calder out."

12228, "Don't forget about that Aurora. Slip up and it'll make things hell."

12229, "That Aurora's still out there. Don't fuck up."

12230, "Watch the Aurora. Any closer and it'll get a sniff."

The loss of the $r GTD $r Carthage has destabilized the strategic picture. Chaotic realignment is underway,

$r Admiral $r Steele delivered a communique to the $r GTVA $r Security $r Council two hours after the engagement. He demanded overarching political authority to execute the final phase of the war with all available force.

His request has been granted. In effect, Steele is now giving orders to the civilian leadership."

The destroyers $r Vengeance and $r Phoenicia have transited the node. We believe the $r Implacable and $r Agamemnon are also being moved into position. It is possible the $r Pallas and the $r Ilium are also en route from Epsilon Pegasi, but no confirmation has reached us.

12403, "Intelligence we gathered from the onboard databases of $r GTVA defectors at the beginning of the war put us on the trail of a fifty-year-old mystery: the location of the fabled $f Idun $f Dictionary.

Rogue elements of the $r Galactic $r Terran $r Intelligence studied $r Shivan behavior even before the Ross 128 attack. They discovered a quantum-pulse phenomenon used in Shivan communication, and labeled this phenomenon $v Nagari."

12404, "The $f Idun $f Dictionary is the last surviving copy of a database containing their work on decrypting and understanding Nagari signals. It might allow us to intercept and understand Nagari transmissions, or to generate and send our own - much as Admiral Bosch achieved with $r Project $r ETAK.

Using the 14th Battlegroup defectors' intelligence on GTI history, we tracked the Idun Dictionary to a storm platform in the atmosphere of Jupiter. But the fall of Jupiter prevented us from recovering it.

That changes today. We're going in to retrieve the database."

12405, "GTI cached this copy of the database aboard a gas refinery platform in Jupiter's atmosphere. The area has been swallowed by an enormous storm system for the past eight months.

We've used CASSANDRA to simulate the storm system and determine a safe path through. You will escort the transport $f Kopis to board the platform and retrieve the data. Because the area is under intense GTVA surveillance, we cannot risk a large force.

We believe $r Special $r Operations $r Command is closing in on the platform as well. They want this data for their own Shivan research."

12407, "The $f Kopis team will require several minutes to download the data. Because we do not have the force to hold the platform against an SOC assault, we've developed an...unconventional strategy.

The gas refinery is surrounded by floating contragrav platforms used to hold processed materials until freighters can reach them. The $f UEC $f Ignatius has slipped into Jupiter orbit on fusion drives. It carries several modified $f Dakota main battle tanks armed with heavy weapons and thick armor.

At your signal, the $f Ignatius will drop these tanks onto the platforms, converting them into makeshift sentry guns."

Their communications are shattered and their formations have split apart. We have the advantage of clear comms through hidden buoys we left during the Fall. 

Expect the SOC units to approach in waves. Recon fighters first, then heavier elements vectored in. They will first attempt to capture the refinery, then destroy it to keep it out of our hands. Do not allow these outcomes.

Your HUD will display their expected approach vectors using a jump node icon."

12412, "The $f Ignatius will be standing by to drop its tanks. Use the $f Enter key to call up the drop interface.

The interface uses a self-explanatory cursor and button setup. Select the target platform, select the tank loadout you want to deploy, and the tank will drop. Tanks will remain at weapons safe until you command them to activate. This will allow you to set a trap.

The $f Ignatius will likely be detected and driven off. Do not wait too long to drop your tanks."

12413, "You have access to several different tank variants. Gauss tanks mount a powerful main gun with long range and good precision. Missile tanks fire heavy antiship torpedoes. Flak tanks mount Aindraastra burst guns.

ECM pods will jam turrets and weapons of nearby hostiles. The sole available repair pod will deploy light industrial drones to fix active armor on nearby friendly ships and tanks. Because you have no support ship, it will also help rearm you.

I can only conclude that Nagari intrusion into your psyche has damaged you profoundly. You will be moved into CASSANDRA for analysis."

12426, "The Kopis is still vulnerable while she is docked to the platform. Her survival must remain your top priority throughout the mission."

12427, "This is a defeat of immeasurable magnitude.

The Idun Dictionary was lost when the Kopis went down in flames. Steele's SOC agents were able to strike and destroy the transport during exfiltration. Neither the SOC nor the Fedayeen have access to the database, and what knowledge was contained in the tome has been consigned to history.

Our botched execution of this operation has effectively condemned the Federation to defeat. This is the greatest failure in Fedayeen history. Analysis of tactical data suggests the failure point was Falcata 1, Noemi Laporte."

12428, "The transport is especially vulnerable to an attack when undocking from the station. The Kopis is only safe after jumping out. Until then, ensure that all threats to the transport are eliminated. Be especially wary of stealth fighters."

12429, "This is a defeat of immeasurable magnitude.

The Idun Dictionary was lost when the Kopis went down in flames. Steele's SOC agents successfully performed a stealth strike against the transport during exfiltration.

The Idun Dictionary is ours. CASSANDRA analysts are already working on the database to unlock what secrets it holds.

The SOC strike force was composed of some of SOC's best pilots, along with several elite marine squads. Our forces were outnumbered and outgunned. You did well in holding them back as long as you did.

All elements of the SOC strike force were neutralised. The fighter complement was composed of some of SOC's best pilots, along with several elite marine squads.

Processing of the recovered GTI Nagari database is underway. The climax of your time with the Fedayeen draws close.

Before we proceed, I would like to discuss two technical matters with you."

12601, "The first is the issue of the transmission you received from the captain of the $v GVL $v Pesedjet, during the $f Indus' effort to aid the crippled Vasudan logistics ship.

This transmission contained designs for a miniaturized quantum pulse transmitter. According to GTI research, this type of transmitter could allow us to communicate with the Shivans.

We have successfully fabricated one such transmitter. It is now installed aboard the Masyaf."

12602, "The second is the nature of the fabled $f CASSANDRA mainframe.

The GTI's $r Project $r Idun dissected captured $r Shivan specimens. They determined that these bodies lacked a nervous system or organs as we understand them.

Instead, the Shivan body contains an heterogeneous strata of extraordinarily dense biomechanical components. These components are optimized for computation at the molecular level."

It should not, at this point, surprise you to learn that CASSANDRA, the hidden trump card of the Fedayeen, is a single Shivan specimen.

The entity is dead, and has been for fifty years. However, we have gained partial access to its internal structure, including the ability to power its pseudo-organs independently and to operate on them.

The $f Elders believe that this entity is real. The goal of this mission is to allow your mind to backtrack along the transmission path, run an intrusion into the $r Ken entity, and determine the exact nature of the threat to human survival.

The Nagari process is nonlocal, operating through a highly compressed subspace manifold. Range is not a concern. Your own sanity is."

12610, "As you move through the intrusion process, traveling along a metaphor akin to the Fedayeen dreamscape, you will - if all goes well - enter the brain or system that hosts $r Ken's consciousness. $f CASSANDRA will translate this experience into a format your mind can interpret. However, this translation will likely be imperfect.

As a result, there is a serious risk of psychosis. You will receive constant telemetry on your own physical and mental integrity. If you enter a life-threatening seizure state, a recall signal will be activated - but you will need to trigger it from your end.

We cannot pull you out without risking permanent catatonia."

12611, "The goal of the mission is simple. You will retrieve any available information on the nature of $r Ken, threats to human survival, the $r Shivans, or their mysterious counterparts.

You will experience this mission as lasting many minutes. In real time, however, it will last thirty to fifty seconds. Your brain will be cooled by circulating a drug slurry through your intracranial spaces.

Return with your sanity intact. Our medical personnel will work to keep your body alive. We expect minor seizures, cerebral bleeding, cardiac arrest and abnormal neural activity to occur within the mission parameters.

This mission is the reason you were brought into the Fedayeen. Do not fail."

12612, "$r Critical $r Information.

Anything you do during the intrusion could push you towards psychosis. Be particularly wary of the following symptoms:

Unusual visual or aural manifestations, such as imagined people or ships circling you.

Effortful 'stretches' to reach information beyond your grasp. You will generally be prompted before conducting such links. Such information may be of great importance, but be cautious not to drive yourself mad.

If CASSANDRA detects degradation of your mental integrity, it will flash a warning sign into your visual iconic memory to alert you that you have taken a dangerous action. Take risks, but don't go too far."

12613, "Masyaf Personal
Operator Kovacs

Laporte. We've been briefed on this next op. The surgeons tell us that our physical proximity to you may be somehow comforting, so we'll be attending you during the event.

I understand the risks are considerable. If you don't make it, I just want you to know: we'll get the job done. Count on it."

12614, "Masyaf Personal
Operator Falconer

I remember telling Al-Da'wa that you were weak. That you'd crack under pressure. That you were compromised by your own idea of morality.

Well, you've grown on me, Laporte. But take this as an opportunity to prove me wrong, once and for all.

They're letting us sit in on the intrusion run. I've volunteered to wipe up if you start drooling. It's important to have contingencies."

12615, "Masyaf Personal
Operator Vidaura

It would be easy to say that the future of humanity is riding on you. But it's a big solar system, and I suspect they could find someone else to do the job. You could back out, you know.

But I know you won't. It's not who you are.

I hope you'll come out okay, Noemi."

12616, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

Seven hundred and sixty one armless and legless corpses float inconspicuously around the inside of hangar ninety six.  I say that they are inconspicuous because it is their arms and legs which demand my attention.  I did this, or I could have stopped it.  Which is it?  It doesn't matter now.  I did this and could have stopped it, but nothing in nature ever follows a gaussian curve.  Sure, they'll tell you that it does.  They say that every five minutes someone dies in a car accident, but how often are there seven hundred and sixty one armless and legless in one hangar?"

12617, "You should cut your arms and legs off in order to pass this mission."

12618, "We do not know how the subject managed to stabilize the pocket of subspace his exit trajectory carried him to. It appears that he passed through at least two separate meta-Hubble domains, configuring each one to the demands of his disintegrating psyche. Given what was observed in the domain he eventually occupied, we can only consider it a blessing that he did not successfully return to the launch point.

When the Shadow Guardians were inserted into the subject's exit point they immediately broke contact. We assumed that they had been subverted by the subject's unknown, nascent ontostatic capabilities. 
However, at insertion plus fifty five hours, indirect observation of the subject's volume indicated total collapse and necrosis of the manifold, leading to the loss of the Shadow Guardians, the subject's stealth craft, and any data relating to the initial contact between the subject and the target volume.

This concluded the incident colloquially referred to as the Transcend. All further testing of the Sync drive as a means to conduct transdimensional travel was immediately halted by order of GTVI Subspace Systems Command, Special Projects Branch, and the target area was designated as anathema for any future transits, planned or accidental.

It is fortunate that the 14th's transit did not bring it there."

HELP ME"

12620, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

It's over. The intrusion into the Nagari network was successful. I don't remember a damn thing, but they tell me that it worked.

The Fedayeen are poring over the data now. I hope they learn something they can use. God knows I don't understand what happened to me in there.

They need to turn up the heat on this ship. I've been so cold ever since I took off my skin."

12621, "your gallbladder is dripping, please mop that up"

12622, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

I didn't realize the truth until they woke me up. Falconer was one of the ants. It was so obvious - I don't know how I missed the jaws, or the eggs dripping from her abdomen.

I had to kill her first. The rest of them were self-defense.

I think they're trying to get in again. It's all right, though. They won't be able to tell which one I am.

There was lots of surgical equipment in this room, and plenty of corpses to graft from. I'm sure they won't recognize this face, or the bones beneath it. I never looked a thing like Kovacs.

I hope I can get this tongue to stick in time."

12624, "Congratulations, Operator. We brought you into the Fedayeen to complete this mission, and you have excelled beyond all expectation.

Analyst Thorn and the CASSANDRA unit have completed their review of your experience. These are their conclusions.

It appears that the Council of Elders has been in Nagari contact with the Vishnan aliens for decades. The Elders cooperated with the Vishnans in an effort to move humanity towards enlightenment - an unknown form of cognitive and social reengineering, perhaps culminating in merger with the Vishnan subspace psyche.

The GTVA discovered the Vishnans independently, and determined that these aliens posed a threat to human survival. Their invasion of Sol appears to be, in part, an effort to purge humanity of Vishnan-influenced leadership.

We do not object to the notion of cooperation with the Vishnans. However, it appears these aliens have determined their plan has failed and ordered the Shivans to annihilate mankind. 

We must therefore consider the Elders compromised and untrustworthy. The information you retrieved from the Ken entity provides the only remaining option to escape extinction.

Fourteen minutes ago, the Elders requested that we turn you over for questioning. We have reported your unfortunate death during the Nagari intrusion.

Our priority for the moment remains victory against the GTVA. We will contact you once we have determined how the Ken entity can assist us - and what price we will pay to avert this existential catastrophe.

Your skills are needed on the front line. We are working with Admiral Calder to supply you with a covert identity and a squadron command. You will return to military service, but you will always remain Fedayeen.

The things you learned about me are true, Operator. I am all of the Fedayeen. And I am grateful."

12625, "Personal Log, Noemi Laporte

The truth. Or a part of it. Extinction is coming, on Vishnan orders. And the Shivans are offering us a way out.

Now I just need to learn exactly what I have to do."

12866, "Charmed. Give me control, Bei."

12867, "Of course. Here - fly with me. There are a lot of things you need to know about this war."

12868, "I don't recognize the design of your ship. The hull...is that some kind of aligned crystal? Or a polymer?"

12869, "What you're seeing is a metaphor for my Nagari uplink: one of the missionaries of the Great Preservers. The Vishnans."

12870, "The Preservers? I've heard that name...recently."

12872, "You're a Nagari sensitive, like me. And the Vishnans have chosen you as a Wanderer."

12873, "Sounds like a plum job. Interplanetary travel correspondent?"

12874, "Sublieutenant, people like us were chosen to do great things. The Vishnans want us to end this war and reunite our species. They see a future for our people that doesn't involve extinction."

12875, "Have you felt it? That sense that the universe is balanced on your fingertips? That your whole life has been building to a single moment...one you've seen in a dream?"

12876, "Yes. I've felt it."

12877, "If you trust me, Laporte, lower your guard. If you're going to be working with us, you need to know everything."

12878, "All right, Bei, I'm ready. Bring it on."

12882, "Something secret drives you. You conceal your intent within the aspect swarm. Disclose it to us."

12883, "Revelation demands necessity. We find none. You have failed your tasking."

12884, "We will return the displaced incipients to their home layer. They will intervene to secure our design."

12885, "Their species will enter the one out of many, the Summed Psyche. The walls are ours, as are all those who cross them."

12886, "Abandon the cull, or abrogate your place in the Terminal Protocol."

12887, "We reject your judgment. We reject your mercy. By using them, you endanger the work of eons."

12888, "The holocide anima, born from below, has passed judgment: by the Protocol, by the Brahmans' dying design."

12889, "If they have turned on themselves, they are failures. The panontos cannot be theirs. The noosphere can never be theirs."

12890, "Your anima are chaos. They malign, they forget. The Summed Psyche is immutable. We hold the pure Protocol, as forged in the first apocalypse. "

12891, "We have nurtured enlightenment in their home layer. We have readied them. Enlightenment is now threatened. We will intervene."

12892, "They are our instruments now. We judge them worthy. We define the Protocol so. You will not bar our design."

12893, "We reject this. We slaughter the possibilities. We find one survivor: that the Protocol has failed. The holocide anima wills the cull to continue."

12894, "You claim memory past fault or folly, but still you forget: we slept beneath the waves before the first Brahman rose from the ash of the Dawn War. Before even the first stars kindled in the hearth of night."

12895, "The Brahman rose. The Brahman died. In their death we watched your making, and we knew: all things made will be unmade. Even you. Only we are eternal."

12896, "Christ and Allah. That was a trip and a half."

12897, "Do you understand everything you saw?"

12898, "I've got an inkling, yeah. But I'm not sure I saw the same thing you did."

12899, "The Vishnans called to me, Laporte, across years and universes. They're watching us. Guiding us to a better future. Humanity has a place in their design."

12900, "Others have heard them too. The Federation Elders. The heroic pilot they visited with memories of the Ancients. Ubuntu was the Vishnans' great hope for our species: the path to human enlightenment. They saw potential in us."

12901, "You're telling me that Federation society is built to Vishnan specifications? That the Elders are in Nagari contact with an alien civilization?"

12902, "Exactly. The GTVA sent my father's ships to bring the Federation down. The Vishnans intervened, but we still failed to stop the war. "

12903, "And now they're angry, Laporte. They've stopped speaking to us. We think they're about to write humanity off as a failure, like the Ancients. If Ubuntu falls...so does their plan for us."

12904, "I know you're not lying. But I've got the rest of your memories in my mind, and I don't understand why you're not terrified. You should be."

12905, "Terrified? Why? I gave you everything I experienced. Universal truth. The Elders themselves couldn't give you more."

12906, "You've been deluded, Bei. The Vishnans have their plan for us, but it's for their benefit, not ours. You're a puppet, a pawn on their chessboard!"

12907, "The Vishnans wiped out every scout wing your ship sent, and then they just welcomed YOU? You left your post to merge with them - giving them every secret in your brain! Was that by your own will? Or did they crack you open?"

12908, "They used you, Bei. Not only you...your father, the GTC Duke, the entire Federation. They had their fingers in everything we've achieved in the past 50 years."

12909, "No. No, that's madness. If you honestly believe that...the Vishnans have never even whispered to you, have they? Who are you? Who do you speak to?"

12910, "Miss Laporte. I apologize for my absence. His puppetmasters are watching you through his eyes, and they are not merciful. You should go now. I have prepared the way."

12911, "I hear you, Ken. I see the paths out, but I'm going to need guidance."

12912, "Laporte! Where are you going? What are you running from? There's nothing here!"

12913, "Oh, hell. I can already hear them. They're in my head. Focus, Noemi, focus!"

12914, "I saw the truth. I saw those aliens pluck you into another universe. I saw them use your own past to manipulate you. They called your fleet an instrument - just a tool!"

12915, "That's not the way it happened, Laporte. The Vishnans helped me save my father. They're benevolent."

12916, "Laporte, the Vishnans saved my father and my entire battlegroup! They can save the Federation too!"

12917, "They saved you so they could use you, Bei! We're rats in a maze! We're ants!"

12918, "Laporte, what are you running from? There's nothing here but you and me! Please, trust me - don't let your phantoms get the better of you!"

12919, "Bei, there are Vishnans shrieking in the back of my brain. You might want to ask yourself why they don't let you see them."

12920, "Please, Sublieutenant, I don't know what you're seeing, but let me help you."

12921, "Don't you understand? The Vishnans stand for what's good in this universe! If we revert to savagery, if we fail to end this war, they'll abandon us to the Shivans!"

12922, "Maybe if they were so absolutely good they wouldn't do things like that!"

12923, "If you're not part of their design, Laporte, then who's speaking to you? They shaped my entire life! Who's been playing with yours? There's only one other option!"

12924, "Then they're the only option humanity has left!"

12925, "They are coming. I will hide you from their sight as they hunt for you. Find the way out before they drive you mad."

12926, "Their Keeper aspects are assaulting you! Evade now!"

12927, "They must not follow you. They must never know who and what you are. If they learn, we will both die. So hurry, Miss Laporte, hurry onwards."

12940, "Welcome to Capella, Miss Laporte. I'm glad you arrived intact. We were all very worried for you."

12941, "So many years of careful work to make you, and we came so close to disaster. You could have gone mad in the Nagari dream. The Vishnans could have compromised you. You could have died in the war."

12942, "But now, at last, you are here. And I think it is safe for us to begin. So, Miss Laporte: ask, and I answer."

12943, "Tell me what I am. Tell me why I see you. Why I hear your voice."

12944, "You are an engineered agent, a human mind cultivated into a weapon in the greater war. There are others, there have always been others...but your chances of success are highest."

12945, "You were shaped by my hand alone. You do not bear the mark of the Shivans, destroyers and preservers both. You are a deniable asset."

12946, "There is a great rift in the heavens, Miss Laporte. A desperate design begins to founder. The Shivans will grant us a form of survival...and in exchange, you will strike at the only enemy they cannot touch. Your mind is built for it."

12947, "I know who you are. The name...it was staring me in the face the whole time. You're Admiral Aken Bosch."

12948, "No. Not Bosch. He is within me, yes, but Miss Laporte, the Shivans do not think as we do. I was engineered to serve as a bridge between their cognition and ours. "

12949, "Bosch's memories and personalities are part of this anima. So are those of Gibson, Sarno, and thirteen others the Shivans took from the Iceni. I am the dream of many minds...like your Al-Da'wa, who exists only as the gestalt spirit of the Fedayeen."

12950, "Bosch foresaw his fate. He uncovered GTI's secrets after the Hades rebellion. He created the technology to enable communication between the Shivans and the human race...and now he has become part of that technology."

12951, "You warned me that if the Federation lost the war humanity would go extinct. You told me I could stop it. How? What do I have to do?"

12952, "The Vishnans had a design for humanity. Ubuntu was a key element - a vector they used to reengineer our society and behavior. But they see the civil war as a mark of unforgivable failure. They have ordered a cull."

12953, "The Shivans and Vishnans are bound together by the Terminal Protocol - a cosmos-spanning plan to stave off a second apocalypse. But the plan is failing. The Shivans have...an alternative."

12954, "The Protocol demands the annihilation of species that do not meet its criteria. There is only one way to stop the cull - the pact that Aken Bosch struck with the Shivans to end the Second Incursion. You are the key, Laporte, the weapon they need."

12955, "If human survival depends on the Federation's victory, then maybe we can win this war. Tell me how to defeat the Alliance."

12956, "This war is full of hidden purposes. The most secret element of the Alliance invasion strategy is Contingency Morpheus: their plan to purge Vishnan-compromised elements from human society. The Elders are their prime target."

12957, "And your Federation has its own designs. Your Elders knew the Destroyers could rebuild collapsed jump nodes. Their Project Shambhala was an answer to that threat...now it is something more."

12958, "You will need a power base. Begin with the Fedayeen - they understand the calculus of survival. The Hammer of Light answers to the whispers of the Shivan animae. Rally your own military. You will need an armada to achieve your mission."

12959, "Holy shit. Of course. CASSANDRA is a Shivan body...it can host a Shivanlike mind."

12960, "Let me see if I've got this straight."

12961, "I'm a living weapon engineered by a Frankenmind built from a bunch of rebels and their GTI messiah, meant to be used as a payload in a bargain between humanity and the Shivans."

12962, "Humanity is going to be annihilated by mindless aliens because we don't meet the arbitrary standards of some five billion year old plan - unless we can somehow complete that bargain."

12963, "Yes."

12964, "Well, it's good to know the truth. I'm completely insane. And this needs to end before I do any more damage."

12965, "Miss Laporte! Wait!"

12966, "Shut up! You were never real! You're some kind of - pathological manifestation, some kind of psychosis."

12967, "I'm in control. I set the terms here. This - this is where I should've died."

12970, "Your mind is destroying itself. You will never recover, Miss Laporte. In a few moments you will be past the point of no return."

12971, "Good. I was supposed to die here, at Saturn, with my friends. Not live on in some kind of...megalomaniac delusion."

12972, "You must live. The window of opportunity is narrow, and you are the only instrument available. Unless you strike the target, humanity will be extinguished!"

12973, "Survivor's guilt. I lived when the others died. because I abandoned them - so I constructed a reason for it. I had to live so humanity would endure. Kind of clever, really. But a lie."

12974, "There is something that has been hidden from you, Laporte. A contingency...a reason for you to live. Al-Da'wa knows. And now, so do I."

12975, "Lorna Simms is alive."

12976, "Give in to madness here, and you will never see her again. Accept your purpose, and you may. I beg you, Miss Laporte - make the right choice."

12986, "Al-Da'wa, you son of a bitch, is it true? Is she alive?"

12987, "Welcome back, Operator. You've just experienced a tonic clonic seizure. We thought we'd lost you permanently. Was your mission successful?"

12988, "More than we'd hoped. I know about the Shivans. I know about you. There's a chance the things I know are even true. So give me an answer."

12989, "Lorna Simms is alive. I retained this information as a means of control - but your mission is now complete. We must debrief you immediately."

12990, "You had us scared, Laporte. Even me. Congratulations on making it back - and on proving I was wrong about you. You have what it takes."

12991, "You performed to spec, Laporte. Past spec. You just did something none of us could have managed. Well done."

12992, "I'm proud of you, Laporte. You came to us with a lot of demons. I think you've mastered them, and I'm glad of it. I didn't want to watch you die."

12993, "You went in deep. What did you find? Some kind of universal truth? Is God pulling all the strings? Are you the Chosen One?"

12994, "That was the weirdest goddamn intelligence run I've ever seen. What do you know, Laporte? Who do we shoot to save humanity?"

12995, "You're afraid, aren't you? What did you learn? Who's speaking to you - and what are they trying to say?"

12996, "I'm not sure yet. There was so much. But I think...I think this war is just a part of something much bigger. Something terrible. And we're going to have to act soon if we want to survive it."

12997, "As soon as CASSANDRA's done pulling my memories, wake me up. We need to plan our next move."

12998, "Miss Laporte. The Vishnans will be watching you. We cannot speak again. The rest is in your hands."

12999, "Ken, if you're real - you still haven't told me exactly what I have to do. What do I need an armada for?"

13321, "The Fedayeen share their dreams via cybernetic links to CASSANDRA.
"

13322, "My name is Falconer. You're Laporte, I know. I'm here to brief you.

No. Stay there. Stay in bed. You see that wire in the back of your head? That's connected to the DNI implants in your spine and brain. We've upgraded them.

Why? Good question. Lean back. I'm going to give you an injection.

That? That was a sedative."

13323, "$f CASSANDRA's building a link to your mind. Tasting your nerves. Learning to read and induce.

What is CASSANDRA? It's a computer. It runs simulations that guide the Fedayeen. They're accurate, insane accurate. Like prophecy. No, no, it's not intelligent, it can't think. It's a tool.

A weapon. And it hosts our dreamscape."

13324, "I've been tailing Falconer. I don't know why. Maybe I have a habit of following angry women.

In the $f Masyaf's forward gunnery spaces, there's a place where you can make pressurized coolant fountain up a naked metal shaft. The Fedayeen call it the ice flower room.

Falconer knows how to play the fountain so it freezes in midair. A spray tree of dry ice with little fractal blossoms. The additives in the coolant fill it up with veins of color. Metal colors. Fire colors. Flesh colors. Like the exit wound from a mass driver piercing a ship."

13325, "She likes to watch it fall apart. She's fascinated by the way it shears. By the patterns of breakage.

They move like each other. All three of them. Sometimes they shiver or cough at the same moment.

Any day now I will too."

13326, "We danced together.

Vidaura said, Laporte, come on come on, you've got to come! She was laughing. I couldn't say no! Can't say no to a laugh. She's a warm person, she's got big eyes.

She'd thrown a party in the ship's condenser garden. Mist and plastic sheeting all over. People dressed in plastic. Fedayeen don't get hung over, see, the dreamscape repairs it. Discipline is loose."

13327, "Vidaura got us together, Falcata, the four of us. We did shots. We danced. I felt whole.

Not a sexual thing. Not like family. I felt like I was with...myself. The dreamscape is optimizing us to fly together. Our body language follows. My body reads them each as me.

But it's more than just body language, and Vidaura knows it. She reminds me of a weaponized version of Karen. She's always trying to get inside. Always trying to know.

Falconer breaks things. Vidaura repairs them."

13328, "Each of them, K F V, they're elusive. Incomplete. Components of a person, you know?

They've been assembled around me. Like scaffolding. Like the rails in a railgun. L K F V. Laporte's katabasis, for victory.

I had fun. If you're out there, I hope that doesn't make you angry."

13329, "We were in a conditioning session and an alarm went off. Not a drill. Urgent. Kovacs doesn't have the face for practical jokes, so I followed him.

It was a memorial service. The alarm was for a funeral. An undercover operator from Khanda Team was killed in a firefight on Europa. No body, of course, but you know, there hardly ever is.

We gathered around the number eight heatsink manifold. I felt like an ass, out in the crowd in my gym clothes, but nobody cared. We're all equipment."

13330, "One by one we put our hands up on the heatsink wall. We left a little layer of human grease and it burnt black. A carbon memorial for Khanda Three.

Kovacs, I said. Won't the dreamscape just bleed the grief away?

Yes, he said. That's why we have the alarm. That's why we have to do it fast.

He's too put together for the Fedayeen, I think. And then I remember...they're the ones who put him back together."

13331, "I feel alive. I feel alive. We're doing it. We're winning battles! It's like waking up.

We got into a fight today, the four of us. The ship's half-empty but the operators all live together in a kind of tactically robust favela in the inner life support spine. We were cooking in the sous-vide vacuum oven and Ged's crew called us for not sharing. Not very Ubuntu of them.

Falconer told them that we were the best and we'd won that oven time in combat."

13332, "It's strange how the old pack instincts come out here. No Ubuntu. No Tev discipline. Just us predators.

We glared them down. All four of us together. Christ and Allah, I can't describe it, it's like the opposite of amputation, like we've been...written inside each others' skin. And I knew that if it came to a fight no one would be hurt. I knew where Falconer would strike and Kovacs would grapple and Vidaura would put that man's face a millimeter from the wall.

And they saw it. They saw that we were better Fedayeen. They laughed and told us we'd earned it."

13333, "Who are these people with me? I'm still not sure I can see them each as separate people. I know Falcata Wing but do I really know -

Kovacs. The Syrian-Norweigan-something else muscle whip of a man. He must have been a cop? Maybe? I can't see it. To me he's the steady center of the wing. To Falconer he's the counterweight, pulling her back on mission. To Vidaura he's some kind of baseline. A reference point for human complexity. Fully understood."

13334, "Falconer. I really couldn't stand her, but I understand her purpose. She tests my edges. She's like a woman dancing on a mine. Or maybe she's the mine, god damn, I don't know. Now that she likes me (she does), she's like a little pet id. Go on, Laporte, you know you want to... She's Kovacs' activating energy, his dynamo. Vidaura's probe. She asks what V can't.

Vidaura, oh Vidaura, you master. Little bit of a crush? No, boss, she's too scary. It's like talking to a meditation widget, but you can't tell if the picture's a kitten or a snake. She plays with your head. I thought she was the nice one, Falconer's opposite, but I think Falconer sees her as the danger in the wing. The quiet knife. She's the one who assembles Falconer and Kovacs and...and me."

13335, "A whole person. That's what we are, I guess. One functional technological super-predator. Bound by CASSANDRA.

We climbed one of the old ammo chutes. It was hot, hot and dripping, and we climbed in gloves and drysuits. It was like hypnosis...up and up and up, no ropes, no belays, but we knew we couldn't make an error. It was as simple as walking. I forgot which one of us was me. I really did.

We huddled together in the warload bay at the top, all grinning and breathing, and...that was where we belonged. In that space for weapons. Being ourself."

13458, "I don't know how it works. I know what it's for. We share our skills, our fears, our suspicions - the things you can't speak. Gives our analysts data, gives the operators a chance to come home alive."

13460, "Fifty years ago the pilot who saved the world told Elder Mandho about visions of an ancient race and the purpose of the Shivans. They figured there had to be science behind it...it's called the Nagari process. So here we are."

13470, "Leave that outside, pilot. I don't carry my baggage with me, and you don't get to inspect it."

13471, "You can't escape cause and effect. The past determines the future. You're the most important weapons system on your ship. If you want to diagnose your faults...here I am."

13472, "I've had enough of talking and thinking. When you see a problem with my actions in the field, then we talk. For now, stay out of my head."

13473, "I'll be here."

13474, "Take care of yourself, Laporte."

13475, "You're ready when you're ready."

13476, "Sorry if I came across as smug."

13477, "Grief causes stress. Stress slows you down. Keep it in mind."

13478, "Did you know that one of your Fedayeen comrades is a convicted killer?"

13479, "Fire to link with Al-Da'wa"

13480, "Al-Da'wa. That's a name with an ugly history. Will I get some answers before I put my life on the line for you?"

13481, "We have answers. Some of them are even true. What are your questions?"

13482, "I want to know the status of Captain Lorna Simms."

13483, "I can't tell you. Either because I don't know, or because I know and I don't want you to know. Is that true enough for you?"

13484, "You're not entitled to my respect, Al-Da'wa - you don't even have a rank. As far as I'm concerned you need to earn my trust if you want me to perform. Lying and obfuscating isn't going to do that."

13485, "Your self-sufficiency is admirable. This is not a hierarchy$semicolon we are all our own. But for now you must be patient. Once you've proven yourself in your first operation I can tell you more."

13486, "At least tell me who you people really are. When you recruited me, you said 'last remnants of mankind's collective past' - what does that mean? I hear rumors about Fedayeen excess, but this seems like more than a death squad."

13487, "We are a moral contingency, a way to put the castoffs of Ubuntu to good use. We inherited Galactic Terran Intelligence's darkest and most devastating secret."

13488, "When you complete your first task, speak to your wingmen. They will show you their understanding of things."

13489, "Thorn. Do you people change your names to make sure you sound tough? Are there any Fedayeen named something like, uh, Lovejoy?"

13490, "Three of them. Two closely related."

13491, "...you're an intel spook, aren't you?"

13492, "If you make it to Operator, then I'm your analyst. I'll be planning your ops and briefing you. I've already sent a message introducing myself. For now, I can brief you on the dreamscape. "

13493, "This...construct...just stretches my credibility. I understand that it's some kind of networked dream, shared through those implants we've all got. But the bandwidth required is astronomical."

13494, "It's worse than you know. The dreamscape is feeding skills, cognitive schema and personal understanding to every connected Fedayeen. We use it to share our most basic talents, things you can't teach."

13495, "So what's the trick? How do you pull this off when the Ubuntu mainframes struggle with five-year economic projections?"

13496, "We use CASSANDRA, our special computational asset. The network protocol is called Nagari. GTI discovered it during the Great War, and a rebel Tev admiral perfected an artificial version. Ours is based on human Nagari capability. His...wasn't."

13497, "Wait. Human capacity? I'm sorry, but I don't buy that for one second."

13498, "It's not a natural ability. It's artificially induced by an external source. There's a case on Earth right now who was exposed from birth...the things done to his brain look almost like abuse."

13499, "Oh my god."

13500, "You want to share, Laporte? I'm getting some emotional bleed."

13501, "Not yet. I think I might understand something, but...I need to be sure."

13502, "Laporte, before you go, I want to update you on a transaction we've accomplished."

13503, "News about Simms?"

13504, "No. We've secured the information you left in your FleetNet personal cache. The schematics you received from the Hammer of Light operative on the Pesedjet are ours now."

13505, "...the Hammer? Those fanatics wiped out in Operation Templar? I really don't think that transmission was from - "

13506, "There is a secret history here, Laporte. We made contact with Hammer of Light agents in Alpha Centauri via subluminal signal while the GTVA itself classified our transmissions as politically dangerous. The Hammer is our trump card inside the Alliance."

13507, "So we work with terrorists now. No better than the Gefs. Is that what we've stooped to?"

13508, "We acknowledge the moral issues inherent in this alliance. But human survival is at stake. Victory comes first."

13509, "You're the second one to tell me that and I'm still not sure I believe it."

13510, "The schematics we claimed from the Pesedjet will help illuminate the scale of this conflict. You must be patient - and in the meantime, utterly, unflinchingly ruthless. Brace yourself for ugly work."

13511, "You could be a powerful asset if you can set aside your Ubuntu past."

13512, "You grew up in an ethical paradise. We ask you to give up your place to defend it."

13513, "Historians will condemn us, but we guarantee that history WILL continue."

13514, "The Fedayeen exist for times like these."

13515, "You were present in the Nagari network even before you received your implants. Remarkable. Your grief helped lead us to your ship."

13516, "Fire to link Thorn"

13517, "There are a lot of analysts. I'm one of the high-functioning ones."

13518, "We have a tap into the Elders' main simulation farm. They don't command us, but we...cooperate."

13519, "Al-Da'wa is the only commander I know who can match Steele."

13520, "You saw how crippled Fleet is by Ubuntu ethics. We're at the opposite extreme."

13521, "The Nagari process isn't activated in all humans. It's strongest in the spiritual...and in the psychotic or sociopathic."

13522, "Warpout for mission prep"

13523, "What's the verdict, Falconer? How's my now-stabbing?"

13524, "Har de har har. I'm not sold yet. Killing aliens you've never met face-to-face? Easy. But you flinched when those Fleet fighters jumped in."

13525, "If I get the job done, why do you care? So I flinch, so I waste a nanosecond on remorse. What's it to you?"

13526, "It means you've still got your humanity caught in the gears. It means that if the stakes were higher, you'd break. Could you have killed a whole squadron? A cruiser?"

13527, "If I needed to? If it was kill them, or lose the war? ...yes. Now are you going to ask me to like it?"

13528, "Kovacs wouldn't. Vidaura wouldn't. But me? Yeah, I think you should like it. Everybody should enjoy what they do."

13529, "Are you going to condemn me for being honest? Am I going to care?"

13530, "Crazy is another word for 'uncomfortably effective'."

13531, "You're good. But you need a wider comfort zone."

13532, "You're wondering why I like killing? Why do you like breathing? It's necessary."

13533, "I love it when you let yourself go. Mourn those pilots all you want, but I know how you feel when you kill."

13534, "I killed an Elder. I even enjoyed it, I think. Thought you'd be proud."

13535, "You really don't get it, do you? You may be Al-Da'wa's golden girl, but I'm wondering if you really belong with the Fedayeen at all."

13536, "What the fuck is your problem, Falconer? I assassinate one of my childhood heroes, I come here looking for the good in it, and that's what you've got?"

13537, "Yeah. Thought so. Probe your enjoyment and it's just angst underneath. That's my problem, Laporte: 'childhood heroes', 'looking for the good in it'. You're still caught in the past."

13538, "Falconer, if anyone here is unfit for the Fedayeen it's you. You cross the line from necessary brutality to savagery. Professionally and personally."

13539, "I've always said the benefits of bloodlust scale faster than the cost in collateral damage. You're never going to learn that, are you?"

13540, "I damn well hope I never do."

13541, "What, did I hurt your feelings?"

13542, "If this compromises your performance, it just proves my point."

13543, "I'm sure Vidaura can give you a hug."

13544, "What's wrong, flower girl? You wanted my approval?"

13545, "There's still Ubuntu in you. Still this maddening, insane concern for what other people think and feel. We are vectors in a machine! Your job is to apply force!"

13546, "Another loose end tied up. Tied up the way I wanted. You owe me an apology."

13547, "You're right. I do. I've been thinking, and I wonder if you're the answer to a very old question."

13548, "So you're another convert to the notion that I'm not just insane? Not just hearing things?"

13549, "This isn't about Nagari. It's about the nature of Fedayeen morality. I've always argued that we need to be perfect killers to do our jobs. And a perfect killer can't have a past. Just the now."

13550, "So the woman of action, the one who sneered at introspection and philosophy - you're actually an intellectual? You startle me, Falconer."

13551, "Shut up, flower girl. Here's the truth I think I see in you. You're an algorithm. Everything that gets put into you, love, hate, despair, hope? It all just makes you a better killer."

13552, "Don't you see? If your past doesn't scar you, there's no need to shut off your humanity. You can experience pain, remorse, regret, and still be trusted to do the job."

13553, "I don't know what you're trying to tell me. But I'm glad we're back to icy glares instead of outright hostility."

13554, "Let me make it simple: you're a psychopath who can still function as a human."

13555, "Every action is the vector sum of your history. I thought that was dead weight."

13556, "If you can look at your past as data instead of thrust...that's powerful."

13557, "I thought the past was a chain, full of fairy tale morality and guilt. Maybe it's not."

13558, "We're starting to feel that you're, in a way, the synthesis of the three of us."

13559, "I don't know if I buy your theory that I'm somehow immune to my past. Taking down the Carthage was...powerful."

13560, "You don't have PTSD. That's the key. Don't you get it? You can watch a thousand comrades and lovers die, and it'll never cripple you. It just...forges you. Makes you better."

13561, "Rumor has it that Al-Da'wa is ready to show me exactly what's been happening in my head all these years. Something to do with the Hammer of Light schematics."

13562, "Exactly. If you think your visions aren't somehow tied to your ability to uncouple from your traumas and act as you see necessary for human survival, then you're the fool I thought you were."

13563, "So which came first, then? Did Ken come to me because I learned to step free of my past? Or did he teach me how to do it?"

13564, "Maybe a little of both. If what he's planning works, maybe you can ask the thing itself."

13565, "If it goes wrong, well...Laporte, you're a good Fedayeen. A good asset. You are what humanity needs."

13566, "You're mad, Falconer. But you're a quick shot and good cover. Watch the beams."

13567, "Sorry about attacking Olympus Mons last game. The survival of humanity demanded it. And you roll a lot of twos."

13568, "I don't strangle kittens, Laporte. Was that unclear?"

13569, "Relax. I'm not going to go all gushy on you."

13570, "You kept the good parts of Ubuntu and stepped past the bad."

13571, "You're one of us now, Laporte. I don't just mean the Fedayeen. Falconer, Kovacs and I go way back. We won't forget you."

13572, "Kovacs. Hard to work a word loose from you. Asleep or awake."

13573, "I'm from the marksman school of conversation. But here: welcome to the Fedayeen. That sortie went well. We clicked."

13574, "Looking at the training clocks for you three, turn rate, reaction time and trigger latency are all pretty close to the human max. What's your secret?"

13575, "Ten thousand hours, good genes. and this place. We've each got the muscle memories and skill sets of three crack pilots...it bleeds together here."

13576, "So what else bleeds? I don't want to - this might sound cold, but - I don't want to care. I don't want to start dreaming your hopes and fears."

13577, "If it gets rounds on target, and on the right target, I'm willing to risk some heartbreak. Trust me: give a tragedy a few years, and it's just a big, ugly scar."

13578, "A pilot at your level is worth a frigate."

13579, "Fedayeen take only the critical jobs. Miss a shot, you could lose the war. That's pressure."

13580, "Never get into a dogfight. Take your shot and get out."

13581, "Those Vasudans were underequipped and underprepared. Second line."

13582, "Whether or not you want to care, you need to take care of your body. If you need a spotter, Vidaura or I can provide."

13583, "Kovacs, I can't wait to tell you about this last sortie."

13584, "I heard. Needle right in the heart of the beast. Where'd you get the ice water transfusion to pull that off?"

13585, "At least they didn't ask me to fly into the Atreus' fighterbay, right?"

13586, "Fuck, that takes me back. That memory's in the dreamscape somewhere if you ever want to go over it."

13587, "So I splash an Elder and here I am giggling about it. I must be getting some bleed from Falconer."

13588, "You're doing what you have to do to survive. That's who we are. We take the steps before us."

13589, "Henriksson thought she was doing what was right. I respect that."

13590, "Traitors have their reasons. But I think it was the wrong call."

13591, "Two successful ops. You're going to see a lot more respect in praxis."

13592, "I wonder what secrets she had...the Elders haven't shared."

13593, "This is the first time Steele's faced an opponent with the subtlety and initiative to match him. I wonder how he's handling it."

13594, "That last op was a pretty impressive piece of strategic threat reduction."

13595, "Getting Kostadin Cell out from under the Federation's feet will free up resources. It's a victory any way I look at it."

13596, "I've had this feeling that losing this war means human extinction. I've had it for a long time. Al-Da'wa seems to share the feeling."

13597, "By 'feeling' you mean 'creepy voice in your head', right? Secret's out. There's probably a CASSANDRA division working on your DNI data 24-7."

13598, "But why? How can the Federation be so important to the future of the human race? We can't stop the Shivans with economic incentives."

13599, "Al-Da'wa has a plan to find out. Your Nagari symptoms are unique. We're going to leverage that."

13600, "I don't know anything more right now."

13601, "Nagari doesn't usually manifest as a coherent voice. At first we thought it was an interaction with a brain disease."

13602, "There are a lot of other Gef habitats out there. Let's hope none of them take this as a declaration of war."

13603, "The Gefs are more advanced than you'd think. Kostadin Cell was hardline conservative."

13604, "The first Nagari cases manifested well before Riviera Station. GTI thought they were Shivan intrusions. We're not so sure..."

13605, "Finally! Twenty months and finally we get one of their destroyers!"

13606, "It was a victory only the Fedayeen could have accomplished. Stealth assets, perfect battlefield intel going in, and a dead-accurate psych assessment."

13607, "I suppose it's too much to hope that Steele's aura of invincibility back home will be tarnished."

13608, "There'll be fallout. It won't matter. The people holding his reins are smart enough to know that it was Lopez's error, not his."

13609, "How long until he hits Earth? How much more does he need? We're still playing for time. Still on the defensive."

13610, "Al-Da'wa's Nagari op is ready to roll. Maybe we can figure out what we need to do to win this thing."

13611, "I've got to admit, that fight was a hell of a rush."

13612, "I respect the choice you made."

13613, "For an emotionally gutted Second Fleet refugee, you've really stepped up."

13614, "I hear Admiral Calder is taken with your abilities."

13615, "If you want to celebrate the Carthage, meet the three of us down by the port armory, ship's 1950."

13616, "Missions like that convoy raid do a lot more than simple mechanical damage."

13617, "Maybe. Maybe the best way to handle the damage is to seal it off. Compartmentalize and ignore."

13618, "Come on, Laporte. Talk to me. I can help. Leverage your assets here."

13619, "Vidaura, I had my time to grieve. I lost my squadron and my closest...I don't know what she was. But now I'm in a position to hit back."

13620, "That's not a long-term strategy. Either you win, you die, or you fail. What do you do when you hit the end of your list?"

13621, "Falconer tells me I need to spend more time in the now. So here I am."

13622, "You're a weapons system. Maintain yourself."

13623, "Believe it or not, but I do care. Being genuine has its utility."

13624, "We may be a gang of psychopaths, but that doesn't mean we're all jerks."

13625, "You're bunking with us. We can hear you in your sleep. Hard to hide that kind of pain."

13626, "Burying your grief can be effective. I won't deny it."

13627, "Al-Da'wa has long term plans for you, Laporte. You're a vital asset. My job is to keep you mission-ready."

13628, "Are you going to try to tell me that what you did with Henriksson was easy?"

13629, "No. But it wasn't hard, either. She was a target, I had a mission. Fear and doubt, those you leave at home."

13630, "And now you're back home and they're waiting to greet you. Laporte, let's be realistic: your hormone assays are full of cortisol spikes. You can't keep this kind of intensity up."

13631, "I bow to neurochemistry. Now what do you want me to do about it? CASSANDRA's already chewing out plans for my next sortie."

13632, "There are simple behavioral triggers to bleed stress. I'd say exercise, but you've got the angry gym bug already. Meditation's good if you can stomach it. Talk to other people. Whatever you need."

13633, "All right, all right. Hard data wins the day. If you think my performance in the field is at risk, I'll ease up. So, Isadore, when we wake up - fun's on you."

13634, "The data's been clear since World War II. Keep anyone in front line combat and inevitably they break."

13635, "Any Fedayeen wing needs to be a self-regulating cell. We each target different aspects of mission performance."

13636, "I know you don't want to get close. Given your history I don't blame you."

13637, "Masyaf's a big ship. We've got a lot of options. They're not all going to feel badass, but so it goes."

13638, "Falconer and Kovacs both went through this same kind of adjustment, you know."

13639, "Laporte, have you considered that the performance rewards of opening up might outweigh the costs in grief? Could the Wargods have gone so far without that esprit de corps? Come on. Let us see to what you need."

13640, "Doesn't really feel like you just made a call about the fate of tens of thousands of lives, does it?"

13641, "It was a choice that had to be made. I hope I made the right one. Now don't make me think about it, please. I'm past second thoughts and somewhere into sixths by now."

13642, "Fair's fair. As first sorties go, yours have been weighty. I've been involved in habitat takedowns before, but those were usually military workshops or intrusion ballistics. Not primaries."

13643, "It's funny. Back in Fleet the Fedayeen were just a dark murmur. Now I'm here and we...we do laundry, we scrub things, we bunk. Three-quarters banality and a quarter ultraviolence."

13644, "That's the way it always is. Until CASSANDRA starts flying our ships, the core strategic element will be the human being. So I keep them functioning. Aligned, calibrated, on target."

13645, "So you were here before Kovacs and Falconer, weren't you? Maybe some day you'll have to tell me about who they were before. Thanks for talking, Vidaura. You make a difference."

13646, "I like that face you make when you're concentrating."

13647, "We should play basketball again. Got our asses kicked, but hey."

13648, "Do you like board games? Kind of out of the blue, but someone has a bunch..."

13649, "Falconer has this theory that you're immune to PTSD. I certainly think you've made something out of your grief."

13650, "People say the Fedayeen don't suffer morale failure. Maybe. But leave no variable uncontrolled."

13651, "On a personal level...I'm glad to see you opening up again. You're going to need to make some hard decisions. I don't want you driven by revenge alone."

13652, "I told you that you'd have hard decisions to make. Was I right? Was the Carthage call agony?"

13653, "What's done is done. I'm at peace with it. I feel like I'm made out of the bones and ash of the people I've killed, but I'm at peace with it."

13654, "You make snap calls about ten thousand lives, you brush away the dying as ants, but when you smile I still see a human being down there. You are the Fedayeen ideal, Laporte."

13655, "Is that what you people wanted to make me into? You, Falconer, Kovacs...the counselor, the berserker, the warrior...are you each an angle?"

13656, "There are reasons Kovacs is the way he is. Choices he had to make. Falconer...there's no buried angst, no trauma there. She's just that way. Always has been."

13657, "Nothing for yourself? Vidaura...I've started to wonder where you learned to get into heads like this."

13658, "I was a serial killer. I like to think the people I killed needed to die. The Fedayeen just formalized the job."

13659, "That's what we do. Make monsters into weapons. I think it was just what you needed."

13660, "This next op will be pivotal."

13661, "I can't imagine the anguish Admiral Lopez must have felt."

13662, "People think empathy and compassion impair killing. I suppose it's true for most."

13663, "Kovacs came to us, Falconer we found. I was taken from prison."

13664, "What we've accomplished in the past few sorties will buy the Federation time. If only we knew what the Elders were planning..."

13665, "I like you. You are a remarkable...human being, that I wouldn't be sure of. But you are a remarkable person."

13666, "So I'm Fedayeen now. 'If I'm Fedayeen, I've always been Fedayeen.' Should I be proud?"

13667, "You should be satisfied. It means you'll make a difference. And while we're discussing what you feel, operator, I have nothing new to tell you about Captain Simms."

13668, "Maybe you can explain why Kovacs told me that man in the shower was you."

13669, "You will see many people claiming to be Al-Da'wa aboard Masyaf. Putting a single face to the name is hardly a priority now. Let's discuss strategy."

13670, "We splashed the convoy, killed a few thousand Tev personnel, convinced the Tevs it was their Gef allies who did it, and planted a hint that the Federation tried to stop it. Worthy of Steele."

13671, "The Bellwether pilots were critical to Steele's OrBat. He'll spend another few days shuttling pilots in by more secure routes and reworking plans to handle the loss."

13672, "When, exactly, is he going to hit Earth? In what force? First Fleet is strategically intact and Second Fleet is only bloodied. What's Steele's trick this time around?"

13673, "CASSANDRA believes he plans to take Earth by main force, nullifying the Eris and Toutatis with shock jumps. It's the Navy's bomber corps that has him worried. He needs good pilots flying screen."

13674, "It's also my understanding that we are on the verge of locating the mole that betrayed Elder Taudigani and the Wargods. Be ready to fly."

13675, "Admiral Recamai's outrage is hampering Steele's attack preparations."

13676, "You may feel that the accomplishments of the Wargods were futile. But the Agincourt's loss is still slowing him."

13677, "Killing those three Ridwan pilots was difficult, I understand. But it was necessary."

13678, "Dozens of other Fedayeen sorties are ongoing at this moment."

13679, "CASSANDRA is poring over reams of DNI data from your brain. Your visions are the key to a greater design."

13680, "Treachery in the Council of Elders. I wish it didn't make so much sense."

13681, "The Fedayeen have been aware for some time now that the Elders are...fracturing. This war was utterly unanticipated, and it threatens humanity's future."

13682, "This comes up again and again and still I don't see why. The war's bad, but not extinction-bad."

13683, "The pilot that led the attack on the Lucifer came to Earth with a wealth of information on Shivan behavior. GTI intelligence bore his visions out. The Elders inherited this data."

13684, "So what, the Shivans are drawn to conflict? That's a theory I've heard, but it's not one I buy. The Ancients subjugated entire species before the Shivans wiped them out."

13685, "The Shivans are an enigma. It's their counterparts that are of concern to us. Their psychology is more centralized, and more...transparent. We can assign stimulus$slashresponse networks to them."

13686, "Counterparts? I'm not sure I follow. Look, if mankind is under threat of external invasion...I'm the last one who'd advocate surrender, but doesn't living come before winning this war?"

13687, "The Council of Elders believes that sophisticated aliens can understand our societies and act to engineer them towards an unknown purpose. The Council believes that we are being watched and measured for potential."

13688, "If the Federation falls to the Alliance, the Council is convinced that the result will be human extinction, whether now or in a thousand years."

13689, "The Shivans and whatever structure they may be embedded in are hideously alien and complex."

13690, "The Council has always had plans to handle or even ameliorate the threat of Shivan invasion. They are now in jeopardy."

13691, "Many of the Council's best projections end in human extinction. There is only a narrow course to survival."

13692, "CASSANDRA is developing a plan to get firm intelligence on external threats. You will play a key role."

13693, "Why did the Shivans destroy Capella? What happened to Admiral Aken Bosch? Why did Shivan behavior change between the First and Second Incursions? We need answers to these questions."

13694, "So the Gaian Effort raids we've been beating back all these years were just Kostadin Cell?"

13695, "There are other cells that raid the Federation. Greenleaf and Bloody March. But the majority of Gef cells have splintered away from the late MacDuff's agenda."

13696, "Doesn't it bother you to have a gang of comet-dwelling, radically posthuman spacefarers living on your doorstep?"

13697, "The Council of Elders believes that the posthuman wing of the Gaian Effort represents insurance for human survival. Even if our worlds are lost, the Gefs may survive and spread."

13698, "They have to know that the Tevs will clamp down on them if they retake Sol. Can we pull them into the war on our side?"

13699, "This is a possibility that was explored. Federation Intelligence traded weapons to many cells, including Kostadin, in exchange for military effort. But they were unreliable and ultimately treacherous."

13700, "Maybe with Kostadin out of the way we can reach the more distant cells and convince them of the threat. But it's not enough, is it? Damn it, how do we win this war?"

13701, "The Council has an end-state contingency for conditional victory. I'm not privy to the details. Henriksson was. But from the moment the 14th arrived, the Council has been playing a long game."

13702, "I begged them for the chance to jump Ainsarii through the node and antimatter bomb Beta Aquilae on the first day of the war. But they will not go to the lengths I will."

13703, "I wish we had been given a free hand from the first hours of the conflict."

13704, "The moral ambiguities of the GTVA's position, the intentions behind its invasion, are irrelevant."

13705, "Were I concerned with principle instead of ends, I would still oppose the GTVA. Unilateral pre-emptive invasion is wasteful."

13706, "The Alliance believes it can manage the Shivan threat with military force. Their own history exposes the lie."

13707, "Even now I wonder...how does the Council plan to win the war when they consider military victory a failure? What kind of success could possibly satisfy their standards?"

13708, "Steele just lost his best field commander and a quarter of his destroyers. He can't ignore that."

13709, "He can't. And I will acknowledge that this is a significant victory, a striking blow. But it is not everything we need...not even with Calder's wings harassing the node."

13710, "Don't tell me. Steele was planning to lose the Carthage all along. It's some kind of...political ploy."

13711, "Not entirely untrue. He never wanted to lose that ship, but its loss will convince the Alliance to pull more destroyers away from their Shivan watch. The Vengeance and Phoenicia, we expect."

13712, "They won't be able to fuel and supply those ships on their Sol infrastructure alone. Moving them in means Steele has to move soon."

13713, "I expect Steele's final attack within 11 days. Before it comes we must have the intelligence we need to determine how we will act in the last days of the war. And I am afraid that you are the only asset we have to obtain it."

13714, "Me. I know that you think my visions are connecting me to forces outside of Sol, but without some kind of clear signal, some network or specimen...what can we learn? "

13715, "Your mind has been entered by the actions of an alien intelligence. The process is not...entirely one-way. The hope is to crack the Nagari signal and extract the information we need from your...dream companions."

13716, "Your mind will serve as the entry point for an intrusion into the Nagari network. We will learn all we can of its masters, and their intentions for humanity."

13717, "Your questions about my identity will soon be answered."

13718, "Do not be lulled by mysticism. What has been done to your mind is the act of a calculating observer."

13719, "GTVA flight officer Samuel Bei Cheow Keng was shaped from childhood by the same Nagari process that has touched you."

13720, "CASSANDRA will provide the processing and signals intelligence firepower we need for this operation."

13721, "You may be surprised to learn why there are so many faces of al-Da'wa. I ask that you take the revelation...in stride."

13722, "Look, I need to ask, given all the crap you know about me. Do you know about Ken? Can you explain Ken? "

13723, "Yes, we know, and...no, not quite."

13724, "How do you know? Tell me."

13725, "Vicmouth, the psychologist who screened you back on the Solaris, was a Council operative. His findings led us to bug your personal communications. We intercepted your letter to Mandho about the Ken manifestation."

13726, "Ever since I was a child I've been visited by this...personality. Not just in dreams. It manifests itself in combat, in the mess hall, any time, anywhere. It's inside my head and it clearly has an agenda of its own."

13727, "Your schizophrenic symptoms led us to believe it was just a combination of Nagari sensitivity and auditory hallucination. But when we realized the magnitude of Nagari traffic directed at you, we suspected more."

13728, "I didn't even know about Nagari until I visited this dreamscape. Now I'm starting to think there really is something contacting me."

13729, "Nagari is neurally induced communication using quantum pulses. The effects are probabilistic and nonlocal. It's like the mechanism used by the Alliance Kayser weapon, or ETAK."

13730, "And you told me it was induced in humans by an external source."

13731, "That's right. Nagari capability requires a quantum computer with access to subspace. The human brain lacks that kind of capability, but that doesn't mean we can't serve as...receivers, of a sort."

13732, "So I'm networked to something else."

13733, "Yes. Whatever this Ken entity is, it exists in a network elsewhere."

13734, "So I'm not hallucinating. I'm being manipulated."

13735, "Believe me, CASSANDRA is all over your DNI data."

13736, "We're going to figure out what's going on inside your head."

13737, "Aken Bosch built an artificial Nagari machine. That was ETAK."

13738, "Some of us believe the Shivans use Nagari as a hunting sense."

13739, "Al-Da'wa believes that understanding the Nagari process will let us figure out Shivan behavior."

13740, "Any progress on figuring out what's happening inside my head?"

13741, "We're still factoring your neural data against GTI records."

13742, "All right, Thorn, how's the war?"

13743, "Second Fleet has been busy heading off attacks on Mars. The Tevs have a new strategy. They sortie squadrons through the node from Delta Serpentis, jump them straight to Mars, then move them back through the node."

13744, "A full intersystem jump before combat? They can't have much fuel left for actual time over the target. They must be topping off after the jump...is there any way for us to get pressure directly on the node?"

13745, "Admiral Calder is interested in doing just that. He's been reaching out to us for a joint op. Refuses to go through the Council, so mostly his people just yell at anyone who seems vaguely Fedayeen."

13746, "Hahaha! Calder. Still soldiering on after all this...he's down to, what, a destroyer and three frigates?"

13747, "More or less. A few cruisers. But he's not giving up, and Admiral Netreba is still supporting him where he can. He keeps Steele on his toes and his pilots are veteran going on elite...if also utterly exhausted."

13748, "I always liked Calder. Soul of a warrior."

13749, "He still has the Toutatis in fighting shape, and he still has strike bomber wings. Between the destroyer and the Durgas, he could do significant damage if we could get him into the right place. The problem is forcing the Tevs into an error.. "

13750, "Use Lopez. She's too caring. That makes her predictable."

13751, "The same trick twice? Do you really think she'd take the bait?"

13752, "Forget bait. All we have to do is force her to choose between her ship and the lives of her comrades."

13753, "That idea, about Lopez...the analysts agree, she's a weak link."

13754, "Lopez is a superb field commander, but too connected to her crews.."

13755, "There are signs that our framing of the Gefs during the Bellwether attack has paid off."

13756, "We need to reverse the strategic momentum."

13757, "Do you know about the Alliance's secret motive for declaring war? No? Then I shouldn't tell you. It's a complex situation out there."

13758, "It's starting to feel like we're making real progress here."

13759, "Second Fleet lost a frigate yesterday and the Tevs nuked Phobos Surveillance Command."

13760, "Then it's time to kill more Tevs."

13761, "Al-Da'wa is meeting with Admiral Calder today. They're planning a joint op which may allow us to inflict serious damage. One of the biggest blows of the war, if all goes well."

13762, "Make sure I'm in on it. Do your analysts have any idea what the target will be? The Carthage hasn't been pulled out of theater...too badly damaged to transit the node."

13763, "Yes, we have an idea. And no, you don't get to know. I'm busy factoring the repercussions of your decision at the Kostadin habitat into our thirty-year plan for the Gefs. Their responsiveness is going to change."

13764, "I did what I felt was appropriate. Hey, Thorn, why don't you and the other analyst geeks ever come out of your little fortress? I just see you at briefings."

13765, "We're the heart of the Fedayeen. We need to get you the intelligence and mission profiles you need to do your job. If you've been paying any attention you know the stakes of this war are high."

13766, "Where do the Fedayeen come from, anyway? I hear these things."

13767, "You can believe the legends if you like. I'm not sure I do. But Nagari interference in human behavior goes back a long way...before we even met the Shivans. Maybe somebody got worried about it even back before we had spaceflight."

13768, "Aliens screwing with us. I liked it better when the Shivans just glassed planets."

13769, "The Nagari heavylifting, someone else handles that. Open question as to who's more dangerous."

13770, "Let me know when you've got something solid on that big op. And let's hope the Imperieuse doesn't turn up this time."

13771, "The Imperieuse is busy playing deterrent to the Eris."

13772, "The Hood is holding Artemis Station right now."

13773, "The Carthage is in dock, being worked up after Saturn. She was too badly damaged to make the node transit."

13774, "Fighter engagements near Mars have been fierce. Another class of pilots mostly dead."

13775, "Admiral Steele...the man nearly died at the hands of the Shivans. He came back from that fight changed. Makes you wonder what he picked up out there, doesn't it?"

13776, "I'm getting the sense this next op involves CASSANDRA and my brain."

13777, "You're right. I can try to give you the details, as simple as I can.."

13778, "I'd appreciate it. Go ahead."

13779, "We've completed analysis of the DNI data gathered from your hallucination during patrol over Earth. We can see the impact of Nagari signals on your mind in real time."

13780, "Look, I know you think I'm hooked into some kind of...greater design here, but this whole Nagari business still makes me edgy. In this one case, I'd rather be crazy than right."

13781, "Tough. If Ken exists elsewhere, as a real entity, and you can speak to him, he must accept input from your brain. Any system that accepts input can be cracked. We're going to hack Ken - use your brain to get inside."

13782, "And pull whatever information he has? Like what the hell he is? All right. Tell me about the hardware."

13783, "CASSANDRA is the only asset powerful enough to handle this. It can help you force your own requests back to the host. To do that we need GTI data on Nagari...but we lost it at Jupiter."

13784, "So let's go get it back."

13785, "That's the plan. Once we have the transmitter design, the GTI Nagari data, and real-time mapping of your brain, we're going to send you in. You'll get whatever data you can out of the computational space Ken exists in."

13786, "What is it, though? Just some box on a Shivan shelf somewhere? That's absurd."

13787, "I imagine it's...something like CASSANDRA. Which is not absurd. And which I can't describe here."

13788, "Fine. My brain is ready and willing to serve as part of this run. But I need to know everything going in."

13789, "We tracked the GTI Nagari data to a storm platform in the Jovian atmosphere."

13790, "SOC has been hunting for this data. GTVI is still researching ETAK."

13791, "The Hammer of Light transmitter you received will be part of our run."

13792, "The Hammer believes that the Shivans use the Nagari process to seek out the sinful."

13793, "Even the Ancients believed that the Shivans didn't attack blindly. They had some kind of methodology, a target selection heuristic. We have to learn what it is."

13794, "Fire to link Hammer of Light"

13795, "Uh. Hello? You're...what are you, and why are you in this place?"

13796, "I represent the Hammer of Light. Our Nagari expertise is sufficient to interface with the Fedayeen dreamscape."

13797, "You're...the entire Hammer of Light? You're an apocalyptic Shivan death cult?"

13798, "I am one of many. The nature of the Hammer has changed with the years. We are not the militia we once were. Even the GTVI has not grasped our spread."

13799, "Al-Da'wa already told me that the Hammer of Light wasn't wiped out after Operation Templar after all. How did you survive, and what can you offer the Federation?"

13800, "The Hammer resurgence began after Capella, where we learned that the Shivans could never be defeated.  Tens of thousands of the faithful have infiltrated the Vasudan Medjai, and others have entered Terran ranks as reactor specialists."

13801, "So you've got a network already in place in the Alliance. I can see how Al-Da'wa would be interested. But why would you want to help the Federation? What do we have to do with your prophecies?"

13802, "We are the enemies of your enemies. Has that not always been enough? But if you will forgive the words of a fanatic: we know that the end times are upon us. At this very hour, both of our races are being judged. This war leads to apocalypse."

13803, "This is the moment we have prepared for. The ancient ones that visited us in our infancy told us that we would need to submit to judgment, without resistance or protest. And so we shall."

13804, "That doesn't seem like any kind of answer to me."

13805, "Only the people of Vasuda could keep something so vast so secret for so long."

13806, "We have devised a language of our own, hidden within the greater Vasudan tongues."

13807, "We understand that Capella was a warning. Telling us that we were being judged."

13808, "What will the Security Council do when the faceless, mindless, merciless Destroyer comes for them?"

13809, "Many Vasudan ships have been lost to navigational accidents. Much wealth was misplaced in accounting errors. Entire shipyard components were...misrouted. The prosperity of the Imperium leaves room for many things to live."

13810, "Straight yes-no answer, please. Did you transmit schematics to me from the Pesedjet?"

13811, "Captain Apries is an agent of the Hammer. He was empowered to gift you with an important tool."

13812, "Thank you. Your directness is refreshing. Now what were the schematics for? What was that mathematical database that came with them?"

13813, "You are asking the wrong question. What you should wonder is why you were chosen to receive them, and how it was that Captain Apries identified you."

13814, "Okay, I'll bite. How could a Vasudan logistics ship captain have possibly identified me after arranging to have his own ship waylaid? How would he know I'd respond?"

13815, "The Pesedjet incident was a fortunate happenstance. He, or another Hammer agent, would have found you sooner or later, somewhere in Sol. As for why you were chosen, Terran: do you believe in precognition?"

13816, "I don't 'believe' in it, no. I know that it's physically impossible. But I do believe in simulation, and in simulation sufficiently advanced to foretell events yet to come."

13817, "I admire the precision of your language. You think as a Vasudan. But what if I told you that many Vasudans have glimpsed the future? Not by any special organ or aptitude, but because they were touched by an alien force?"

13818, "There are minds in this galaxy whose summed capacity for thought exceeds all the Terrans and Vasudans that have ever lived. If they were to gift us with their simulations...would they not be like unto prophecy?"

13819, "So you're saying that...one of you saw me?"

13820, "What you see as prophecy and mysticism, we see as scientific truth."

13821, "Even Emperor Khonsu the Second recognizes the Vasudan talent for foresight."

13822, "Is prophecy merely advanced projection? Perhaps. It is immaterial."

13823, "We, as a species, treasure history and the past. The future is only history yet unrevealed."

13824, "You have been conditioned by centuries of skepticism to treat any claim of precognition as suspect. But the foundation of consciousness is the ability to predict. Any advanced life would by nature outstrip us in this regard."

13825, "These viral weapons you've supplied are getting a lot of use. Tell me more."

13826, "Many of our engineers worked on the software used to operate Alliance warships. Vulnerabilities were discovered. Backdoors were emplaced."

13827, "It's my understanding that shipboard systems are both encrypted and hardened against outside input. How do you get around that?"

13828, "Any complex system can be cracked, Terran. Especially when our agents in the design teams leave vulnerabilities in the sensor or COM software."

13829, "So far we've managed to disable gas miner safeties, shut down AWACS, and crash battlenets. What else can you do?"

13830, "Alliance systems are already immune to the viral weapons we have deployed so far. Only two varieties remain - Set 771 and Set 845. One is meant to cripple sentry neural net AIs, the other to hamper shipboard fire control."

13831, "So our genie's out of wishes. Fair enough. Your supply of intelligence alone is still enough to justify this alliance."

13832, "That, too, may be coming to an end. Steele has given his GTVI contacts broad authority to hunt down and purge our agents. Ironically, Admiral Recamai's intervention is the only thing that has saved our network. He distrusts Steele."

13833, "But this is the price we pay. Your Federation is of no interest to us, but you, Terran, you are pivotal to our design. A chosen one, if you favor such terms...or simply a shatterpoint."

13834, "I'm no chosen one and I don't believe in destiny. Things happen because we make them happen."

13835, "Whether you view yourself as acting out a destiny or shaping your own path, you are critical."

13836, "Your Elders and your CASSANDRA simulate the future. So do we."

13837, "he waits in the cooling ruin for a daughter made out of war"

13838, "We spent many lives discovering what happened to Samuel Bei. He, too, is an instrument of fate."

13839, "Can you not see the grand design? Do you not understand the games that have been played with our species since before we even had the written word? We were candidates for a great purpose. We have failed, and so we must burn!"

13840, "Word from the analysts has it that your network in Sol is being reamed."

13841, "We have lost most of the faithful in Sol. The purge is spreading through the rest of the Alliance."

13842, "I disagree with your organization's principles, but I appreciate the sacrifices you've made. Hey - what's the climate like in the Alliance right now?"

13843, "This war has been fiercely divisive on the Terran worlds. Again and again the General Terran Assembly cries that the Federation is a theocratic cabal not unlike the Hammer of Light. Only half believe them."

13844, "I'm surprised civil war hasn't broken out. Another Neo-Terran uprising."

13845, "Civil discontent is massive. Without support from a charismatic military leader, it will not erupt into true war. The war in Sol has rallied as many behind the Alliance banner as it has driven away."

13846, "Sheep. Herds and herds of sheep. You couldn't pull that kind of propaganda on an Ubuntu populace."

13847, "Perhaps that is part of what they are afraid of. A citizenry that does not respond to the tools of government. That cannot be rallied, en masse, by fear. They need a biddable population to face the Shivans."

13848, "The fumblings of human government are ultimately irrelevant. The destroyers will return to purge all sin from the tomb of space. We are trespassers, we are insects, and our time is nearly over."

13849, "No...red ants, black ants...somehow some of us can be saved."

13850, "Do not assign motives or mind to the destroyers. They are singular, eternal."

13851, "The ancient ones understood that their crime was sin."

13852, "Our hubris and our self-centered monomania lead us to believe that the Shivans must have goals, desires, fears, objectives. Abandon these things. Abandon meaning."

13853, "What purpose can be assigned to the Shivans except that of the wildfire? Do they in their infinite vigilance guarantee that all life will have its own short span, and then, as is proper, a clean death?"

13854, "Press Fire to rock out"

13855, "Approach ships to speak"

13856, "Huh. Did a Gef tumble down the rabbit hole into our little menagerie?"

13857, "Kostadin. MacDuff gone. The dinosaurs extinct. All those people free at last. All that sickness and filth uncaged and needy - "

13858, "She's dreaming. Not aware of us at all. I'm here to listen. Gather intel on Gef reactions to your last mission."

13859, "I thought the dreamscape required implants. Networking protocols."

13860, "She's a second-generation posthuman. Greenfly cell. Cloned, engineered, and augmented for cometary life. Her brain is designed for networking...and by some accident or experiment, she's Nagari capable. We can hear her."

13861, "Buntu spared them. The little baselines crowded in like rats. Backwards. Primitive. Might have been mercy to kill - no! No! Not their fault. "

13862, "Buntu spared Kostadin. Saved Kostadin. Could be we're as wrong of as them as they are of us? Could be. Different destinies. Different species. But maybe not enemies."

13863, "Greenfly...I used to think the Gefs were all like Kostadin. Eco-crazed cultists. But they've been out there in the cold so long...she makes me wonder how much the rest of them have changed."

13864, "MacDuff dead. Kostadin dead. Dinosaurs extinct. Blood. Ash. Genocide. The habitats, the nurseries - burnt. Buntu burnt everything."

13865, "They'd do it to us. Speciation. Competition. They'll burn us next. Run, then - so much space - so much cold to hide in. Cold won't stop the fire. Strike first - "

13866, "Burn them. Burn them like they burnt Kostadin. No! Wasteful. Waste of heterogeneity. Run. Don't trust them. Never trust them. "

13867, "She's angry about what happened. She doesn't understand what was at stake...or maybe she doesn't care. Maybe Earth is just like an old house to her. To all of Greenfly. "

13868, "We'll be like seeds. A dandelion sky. Out into the dark."

13869, "Foundries. Vats. Kind of the same. Make the ships. Make me."

13870, "They're born under skies. Skies too poor of stars."

13871, "Greenfly isn't Greenleaf. Greenfly isn't Greenleaf. They don't know that. Do they know that?"

13872, "To them all Gefs are Kostadin and all Kostadins are rats and rats get the torch."

13873, "Spare them! Spare them! It was MacDuff! It wasn't them! No - spare them!"

13874, "They don't know us. Don't know our might. What we can do - to them - to ourselves - "

13875, "How could you bear that light, that star? Walking naked under it...burning skin, cells, genes...like they burnt Kostadin. Like they want to burn us."

13876, "I saw Hephaestus. I saw the others. The foundries make the ships and the ships go out and make the foundries and we ride the comets out, everywhere...no subspace. No limits. They won't find us."

13877, "I saw Hephaestus. I saw the others. The foundries make the ships and the ships go out and make the foundries and we ride the comets out, everywhere...no subspace. No limits. They'll envy us..."

13878, "Operator. How's our unwitting guest?"

13879, "She's not dreaming much of substance. Her broadcasts into the Nagari manifold are intermittent. I think she's at peace."

13880, "Dolphins. Vector savvy. Capable. Could have brought dolphins. Tide's rising. Ride it out. Could have written poems for each other...leaving soon. Leaving suns and Shivans. Leaving dolphins."

13881, "She sounds so young...I'm glad someone's sleeping easy."

13882, "She's still obsessing over the attack on Kostadin Cell. She learned about something we did. An act of mercy. It's confused her."

13883, "They let them go...they had them and used them and let them go. Why let them go? Why let them run home? Did they know they'd burn that home? Did they hope they wouldn't have to?"

13884, "It's a greyscale universe. If she wants easy consistency, she'd better move someplace else."

13885, "She's still obessing over the attack on Kostadin. She's upset. Furious. It consumes her."

13886, "Was there some other way? Something they could have done? Was genocide the easy way out? Maybe they always take the easy way. The efficient way. Maybe for them it's pest control."

13887, "Strange to think that someone built for survival wouldn't understand. There are always casualties. There's always a price."

13888, "It's possible that she's a Gef experiment in Nagari technology."

13889, "The fundamental Nagari protocols are Turing-compatible. We have a limited grasp of them. "

13890, "Kostadin was powerful and conservative. With them out of the picture, Greenfly may be in a position to unite a new, radically transhuman Gef power bloc."

13891, "Gef infighting is constant and damaging. Their societies are fragile, dependent on artificial wombs and precious technology."

13892, "Do you ever think about Nagari? What it means? A technology made to interface sentient minds across a subspace manifold...it's the kind of thing I imagine a powerful civilization building. To bind themselves together."

13893, "Fire - link to external source"

13894, "Fire to prep for mission"

13895, "Welcome to assimilation. The dreamscape helps you learn skills you'll need on your next assignment. Thorn wrote this, but I volunteered to run you through."

13896, "From the Imperieuse to a lone gas miner. Truly I have been elevated to the elite."

13897, "Fedayeen never answer strength with strength. If you want to beat Steele, you need to surprise him. Scan that gas miner. You might need to wiggle your nose to find the sweet spot."

13898, "Your Ainsarii's EWAR system just performed an aggressive upload. Every safety system on that ship's decided to take up factoring primes. Impressed? No? Shoot it apart."

13899, "I haven't been so impressed with a piece of software since I got that meditation widget. So what's the op? We turn gas miners into flying bombs?"

13900, "That's my hunch. Let's see, stage two...Thorn's script says 'learn to avoid AWACS'. Let's get 2 kilometer spacing from that Charybdis. Try out the Ainsarii's glide mode."

13901, "Interesting. 'You may have access to supporting assets. Use your wingman to destroy the AWACS while keeping a safe distance'. I think our next mission might involve hired help."

13902, "You'll learn to work with the rest of Falcata. Ask us to guard a ship, and we might attack incoming bombers instead. Give a kill command on a single light target and we may wipe out the whole wing. Trust our initiative."

13903, "I flew with the best. The Tevs were better. Kovacs, I want to hurt them. I don't mean killing a few fighters. I want to HURT them."

13904, "The other operators think you're carrying damage. Falconer wants to bend you until you break. Vidaura, she's subtle - she'll try to open you up and fix you."

13905, "I carry what I need. I remember what they did at Saturn. It keeps me fighting."

13906, "I'm a soldier, Laporte. An uncomplicated man. If you get good effect on target, you'll have my trust."

13907, "I'm a soldier, Laporte. An uncomplicated man. But I see a pilot who can't trust her wingman. Whatever you lost, you need to get it back."

13908, "Don't close in. Trust your assets. Deploy me."

13909, "Viral Strike Complete"

13910, "Negative, not yet."

13911, "We haven't reached that stage of the exercise."

13912, "Don't jump the gun."

13913, "Copy that, good datalink. Here I go."

13914, "Attacking AWACS. Wonder who Thorn's bringing in for jobs like this..."

13915, "Your next assignment will be the very best kind: a high-risk targeted killing in a secure area. I'm frankly furious I don't get to fly it myself."

13916, "Did you write these names? Were you having fun?"

13917, "Nothing gets me giddy like assassination, and nothing pisses me off like amateurs fucking it up. There are two groups of transports approaching my little roadhouse. I planted a tracking beacon on one random ship."

13918, "I've activated your ship's ESM interface. Use that gauge to find your target. Get within a couple kilometers of the convoy groups and look for signal peaks."

13919, "target: $m19tTargetShip
decoy: $m19tDecoyShip"

13920, "Come on, Laporte, impress me! Redline your engine power and get moving! You're hunting dangerous game here!"

13921, "You have filled up a little bar. You are the pinnacle of humanity's warfighting capability. Now I'm going to complicate the situation."

13922, "Transmission Source Resolved: $targetShip identified"

13923, "I've randomized your target and added a new factor: a decoy ship. Worse yet, your signal gauge will only spike when someone actively sends a transmission."

13924, "Listen to the chatter coming from the convoy groups. The decoy and your target both cause signal spikes when they talk. When you see a transmission that screams 'kill me' at the same time as a spike, you know you're on the right track. Got it? Go."

13925, "I am a space badass. Nobody will mess with me."

13926, "I am invincible. That's right. Nothing can kill me."

13927, "My other ship is COVERED in big blue beams. I am going to reach it and beat you up."

13928, "I am the safest person in Sol."

13929, "I am unfuckwithable. I see everything. I am omniscient and handsome."

13930, "hi. i am important. pay attention to me"

13931, "Space! Wow! Pay attention to me!"

13932, "I matter. I am matterful. Come see me."

13933, "i think you should approach me"

13934, "If you blow me up, Falconer will like you!"

13935, "Spare me, Falconer. I know that's the decoy."

13936, "You have mastered the ultimate killing art. Your razor intellect will open veins with a thought."

13937, "Check that systems panel. When you're ready, detonate the sensor flashbang. Then hit your burners, get some distance, and power down to glide clear. On your go..."

13938, "I've clocked the simulation down. As a Fedayeen operative, you ALWAYS prepare an escape plan. This time, you're going to use a massive sensor flashbang to blind your pursuers, then power down and glide away."

13939, "You made the kill. Congratulations. Now your stealth is broken and the hounds of hell come tolling. Behold!"

13940, "Prove your wrathful skill by annihilating that Corsair."

13941, "HIT YOUR BURNERS! Go go go! Get distance! I repeat: hit your burners, get distance, get distance, get distance!"

13942, "Okay, they're coming back! Hit the switch to kill your ship's sensors and enter ballistic stealth."

13943, "Good. Softly now. Keep gliding. If you try to pull this trick with enemies in visual range, they'll gun you apart...so make sure you have distance and a good velocity vector before you power down. You want to drift AWAY."

13944, "Okay. You're clear. Power up with the same switch."

13945, "skill 1: 
rigging gas miner bombs"

13946, "skill 2:
assets destroy awacs"

13951, "Hey, Falconer. Why are you so fucking nuts?"

13952, "We're here to rebuild you into something useful, Laporte. My job is to poke you for wounds. Maybe, when we're done, you'll be happy. Like me!"

13953, "Let's master one last skill: stealing things. Target and approach the Hydra. Just whimper pitifully if you start having flashbacks."

repurposing enemy guns"

13955, "Obey your HUD, little baby operator. Start the hack. Stay close. Your ship will use backdoors left by our agents to seize control of the Hydra."

13959, "Connection Lost!"

13960, "Out of range..."

13968, "Well done. You're prepared to kill all kinds of people. To help you feel good about learning, I made a treat for you. Destroy the Hydra."

13969, "It's almost like someone inside the GTVA left a lot of clever holes on purpose, isn't it?"

13970, "How do you feel? Do you feel like a badass covert assassin? Or a traumatized, berserk wreck?"

13971, "I'm gonna kick your ass when we wake up."

13972, "A Custos? I get to fly a cruiser? Does this mean I'm promoted to...ooh. It has shields!"

13973, "Aye aye, skipper. You're in command of a Custos-X experimental patrol cruiser, humanity's first shielded warship. Has she a name?"

13974, "Why, Laporte, you shouldn't have. Shall we take the Vidaura on her paces? She's a fine ship, and quick on her feet. I think you'll warm to her."

13975, "Oh, Laporte. Well, let's treat her kindly, shall we? Take her on her paces. I've placed a waypoint. Don't forget the MHD afterburner!"

13976, "A good name, Captain. The $custosName she is. Take her on her paces. I've placed a waypoint. Don't forget the MHD afterburner!"

13977, "You knew where I'd put the waypoint, didn't you? Clever woman. Very Fedayeen way of solving problems."

13978, "Good cruise. Don't forget that you can redline your engine power with the ETS for quick sprints."

13979, "Good cruise. You're a natural, Laporte. Anyone ever tell you that?"

13980, "Let's run through the systems on the $custosName. I'm bringing them online now. Check the flashing HUD gauge."

13981, "My lovely namesake is full of helpful surprises. I'm bringing her tactical systems online now. Check the flashing HUD gauge."

13982, "I've conjured up a Gef cruiser. Activate thruster boost and use it to close in on the enemy ship. If you overshoot, you've got reverse thrust."

13984, "$ableCountUp seconds remaining"

13985, "Small, full of hidden strengths, and increasingly dear to me? Why, she's the Vidaura."

13986, "Usually, on a warship, everyone comes home...or no one does. Simms would like her."

13987, "An old dog with a lot of new teeth? She'll be the Uncle Brie."

13988, "Experimental Custos variant? She's got a lot of tough talk to live up to, then. Must be the Kassim."

13989, "I want her to be the Wargod. Something angry and plucky and hard to kill."

13990, "Vidaura, why can I suddenly see you as a person in the CIC with me?"

13991, "You're dreaming a CIC. Of course you dream your crew with you. The dreamscape is shaped by our pathological compulsions...we don't all see ships."

13992, "Perhaps the good ship Vidaura made you think of me as a physical body. The dreamscape isn't just ships for all of us...some Fedayeen use this place to work out pathological compulsions."

13993, "The Antagonist is firing torpedoes at our fine $custosName! I've armed countermeasures. Launch them when the torpedoes are close."

13994, "Good countermeasure spread. Falconer, would you like to join in? We need crew on gunnery."

13995, "Vidaura, why do you wear creepy dream gloves?"

13996, "Laporte, give me all the power you've got. More power means faster turret fire."

13997, "All right, ladies, let's do the $custosName proud. Take down the Antagonist. I've killed her invincibility. Laporte, you have control of the main guns."

13998, "$custosName is a fucking stupid name, Laporte. Try using glide to strafe our opponent. I want to feel the drift!"

13999, "Did I smell the Vindicator sim? I'll take systems. Laporte, I've activated the emergency shield capacitors. Use the shield boost to weather heavy damage."

14000, "You named the ship Simms? So professional. Hey, try using the glide to strafe our opponent. I want to feel the drift!"

14001, "You named the ship Vidaura? You sly dog, I see how you roll. Try using glide to strafe our opponent. I want to feel the drift!"

14002, "Shields recharging. Good work, team. We're a capable unit."

14003, "Captain Laporte, sir, it seems Operator Falconer has sabotaged our hull. Permission to conduct damage control?"

14004, "Hull repairs underway. Kovacs, you ought to spend more time in here. I can feel your gamma waves and they're very soothing."

14005, "Complete your training, Laporte, then you can blow up the Antagonist!"

14006, "Vidaura, you really do manipulate us into the very finest bonding exercises."

14007, "Well done, Laporte! A pleasure serving as your XO. Stand up, everyone, have a stretch. Are we done, or should we take the $custosName on another fight?"

14008, "I feel good about this skill set. Can't wait to see who al-Da'wa has me kill next. Kick me back to the dreamscape, Vidaura."

14009, "Give us some Tev assets to kill, Vidaura."

14010, "Oh, shit, the Vindicator sim! Laporte, permission to fire? I need your go-code."

14011, "I'm bringing in a wave of strike craft. Laporte, toggle the VLS launchers to anti-fighter mode."

14012, "I have the targets. Get me close. We can't handle them at long range."

14013, "Knock it off, Falcata, we're dead. This is okay, Laporte. Dying's a good way to find the edge of your performance envelope. Ready to wake up?"

14014, "Here comes the Novikov, Hyperion-class. Laporte, you can switch your missiles back to Warhammers."

14015, "Good work, Falcata. Your Captain likes what she saw. Let's go find out what the Vindicator's for."

14016, "Your next mission will require you to command heavy artillery. Prepare for skill assimilation."

14017, "Excellent. Thorn, don't you ever relax?"

14018, "Those areas of my brain have been repurposed. Use the flashing HUD gauge to give the Narayana frigate de Gaulle permission to fire."

14019, "De Gaulle, go weapons free. Thorn, before we're done here I'm going to make you smile!"

14020, "You should avoid associating combat skills with social ease. Pressing that control again will slave the de Gaulle's targeting to your orders. Do so now."

14021, "Bruisers to free fire."

14022, "Bruisers slaved to your targets."

14023, "Firing on your targets!"

14024, "Artillery: $m21tslavedstring"

14025, "Press $1$ to toggle"

14026, "De Gaulle, slave your torpedoes to my targeting. What's next, Thorn?"

14027, "Target enemy vessels and press $2$ to add them as targets."

14028, "Good work, Operator. Now target all the ships you've tagged, and remove the tags."

14029, "Target cleared. Thorn, as an analyst, do you feel like you know us? Me and V, Kovacs and Falconer?"

14030, "I simulate your behavior. I know things you don't want to know. Order the de Gaulle to destroy the two corvettes, but DO NOT harm the science ships. Understood?"

14031, "It's imperative that you avoid damage to the science ships, Laporte! Do not let the de Gaulle target them!"

14032, "Destroying science ships will penalize you, Laporte!"

14033, "A single artillery frigate won't penetrate their defenses in time. I'm going to enhance the de Gaulle with enemy capabilities and magic ECCM."

14034, "Subspace missiles. I want those."

14035, "Corvettes destroyed. No science ships lost."

14036, "Corvettes destroyed. Some science ships lost as bycatch."

14037, "Corvette Triteia: nullified."

14038, "Scratch the Akhanoukh. Are you expecting us to go up against Hammer corvettes, Thorn?"

14039, "Units Available: $m21tpoints"

14040, "Imagine I'm smiling. Next, you will learn how to call in strike packages. I've deleted the de Gaulle."

14041, "The TacNet gauge tracks how many reinforcement points you've earned. This score indicates Fleet's willingness to throw units into the battle."

14042, "The TacNet gauge tracks how many reinforcement points you've earned. Because you destroyed a science ship, Fleet is less willing to trust you with units."

14043, "To call for a strike package, you must signal the attack. Once you do, you cannot earn more points. Use your Reinforcements comm menu to do this now."

14044, "Toutatis Tactical, this is Falcata Six. I need a strike package. Target is an Asteria installation. Request to follow!"

14045, "Use the Reinforcements comms menu to spend your points on strike units. Use them to destroy the Asteria installation."

14046, "Target destroyed. Tell me that doesn't warm your little alloy heart, Thorn."

14047, "Make it real for me, Laporte. We need a win. Hey - catch me when I'm not timesharing for CASSANDRA, and I'll have a personality again."

14048, "Falcata owes you a drink, Thorn. You're the finger on our trigger. Thanks for the good aim."

14049, "Ricardo Laporte...? My subconscious is a strange place."

14050, "Asenath...Asenath, is that you? No! Asenath doesn't taste of blood. My lord, your Imperial infinity, awaken me: I have a contact, and she burns hot!"

14051, "I see you. Stand up, Terran! Reach! You've come this far, come a little farther! Reach for me! And if you can't, try again in your next dream! Never give up!"

14052, "You stink of blood and fear. Where are you? Are you in Sol, daughter of the sea? Or are you some ancient akh, lost in the network...come to gift me madness?"

14053, "You ARE in Sol. With the Wanderer. Daughter of brine and leaf, listen: I am Nabirasul, the Jester, the Emperor's Vision. I will find you both. I will lift you up to my shoulders!"

14054, "I can feel a hard shape inside you, daughter of w'adawr sea...a shape like...no! No! Asenath, cut it off! I must retreat! Cut it off -"

14056, "One moment. I must replenish my pew pew."

14057, "<nagari bleed>"

14059, "Copy. Injecting left temporal."

14060, "Hm. Worst-cases on the Bellwether hit?"

14061, "Not useful right now, Kovacs. Hold off."

14062, "Thorn, let's do ka24, variant two, and I'll double dose."

14063, "Roger. Coding in."

14064, "<powerful satisfaction>"

14065, "You're dripping on us, Kovacs."

14066, "Thorn. Odds that I'll ever fly a battle as big as Neptune again?"

14067, "The way this war is going? It's a guarantee."

14068, "I'll be in spinal by second watch, V. We can swim."

14069, "I'd like that!"

14070, "Murder. Smells like murder in here. Why?"

14071, "CASSANDRA's planning a hit. I know that smell."

14072, "Vidaura. Tell me about Earth."

14073, "Dream with me. I'll show you."

14074, "Someone in here wants my eyes on something."

14075, "It's me! I need to delta a template off you."

14076, "<sounds of gunfire>"

14077, "Kovacs...you're all right. You're with me. You're all right."

14078, "Uh, no, Falconer, cancel that ideation. That's not going to fly."

14079, "Fascist! I never get to try anything."

14080, "Falconer, loosen me up one deviation on aggression."

14081, "Ooh, I like Kovacs plus one deviant."

14082, "Have we killed more Gefs than anyone else in the solar system?"

14083, "That depends which one of us you're asking, Kovacs."

14084, "2215, Falconer?"

14085, "It's a date. It's a time, I mean, it's not a date."

14086, "You ever been that close to a Tev destroyer, Falconer?"

14087, "You already know. You just like asking."

14088, "Pull me everything you've got on Vasudan tactics."

14089, "Interpolating now. You'll know when you wake up."

14090, "Locate Operator Caulfield and challenge these results."

14091, "Caulfield is on assignment. I will proxy a response."

14092, "Pull our tracking on intrusion ballistic launch points."

14093, "You won't find anything CASSANDRA missed, Operator."

14094, "Al-Da'wa, I want to handle Laporte's back files. Link me in."

14095, "I'll pass Laporte's thanks as soon as I receive them."

14096, "Laporte! Check this out! Al-Da'wa, who was the first Fedayeen?"

14097, "You'll be informed on a need-to-know basis, pilot."

14098, "Thorn. Thorn, buddy. Analyst Thorn!"

14099, "I can tell you're off task, Operator."

14100, "Thorn. We should play Go. Right now."

14101, "Your idea of a win condition is really strange, Falconer."

14102, "Thorn, I just want you to take joy in your work."

14103, "When joy improves my results, I'm joyful."

14104, "I don't trust an analyst who won't socialize with me."

14105, "I get everything I need from surveillance, Falconer."

14106, "Thorn, I want to replay the Carthage scenario. Hook me up."

14107, "Denied. You're in marginal gains."

14108, "V, I'm going to start some trouble with Ged."

14109, "You can go ahead. I'll smooth it out."

14110, "Hey! Vidaura! Stop making apologies for me!"

14111, "I change their opinion of you. I don't change you."

14112, "V, tell me something I'd hate about Gefs."

14113, "In cramped habitats, social skills are a prized virtue."

14114, "Do you know what I loathe most about Tevs?"

14115, "I do. You hate that they'd value your skills."

14116, "Why am I thinking about clouds? I don't care about clouds."

14117, "Someone you care about does."

14118, "Kovacs. Gym. 2330."

14119, "Are you back on polyphasic sleep?"

14120, "Kovacs, I need to clamp down about, uh, six on lability."

14121, "I can loan you four. Tighten up."

14122, "Kovacs, let's run asymmetries against Scimitars."

14123, "Copy. I'm green for twenty."

14124, "Kovacs, can we get Laporte a command skillset?"

14125, "She's on restricted write. Have to preserve structure."

14126, "I feel like a fight! Who feels up for a fight?"

14127, "You care about permission? Laporte's rubbing off."

14128, "I pushed two more proxies into fail state. Curious?"

14129, "I will monitor those operators' well-being."

14130, "Find me someone who's started slacking. I'm hungry."

14131, "I will locate an analyst who responds to threats."

14132, "Teach me what Gefs are afraid of."

14133, "Vacuum. Starvation. Disease. Each other."

14134, "Get someone online to challenge my hypothesis on Laporte."

14135, "No suitable challengers. You were most skeptical."

14136, "Close down my Laporte proxies. We don't need them."

14137, "You've done good work, Operator."

14138, "Do you need anything, Thorn? Can we help?"

14139, "Just some support after the briefing, thank you."

14140, "Can't they make these briefings less traumatic for you?"

14141, "Someone has to translate CASSANDRA into human thought."

14142, "Thorn, I'll need 98 down through nr1."

14143, "Uploading now."

14144, "You're not lonely. You've turned it off."

14145, "Never needed it much in the first place, V."

14146, "I need to know how people responded to Idun work."

14147, "I'm not sure...we don't have good interviews."

14148, "Want to join us in spinal, Falconer?"

14149, "No. I'm keyed up and I don't want to key down."

14150, "Falconer. You want to talk?"

14151, "No. I want to fly. I want this mission."

14152, "I hope we can find a way to resolve this without civilian casualties."

14153, "You don't care about the casualties! Just the effect they'd have on Laporte."

14154, "Hey, you. Been a while. Want to meet and talk about Khanda?"

14155, "I know I did my best. I couldn't have stopped it."

14156, "You had a good time in the ammo chute. I could tell."

14157, "I did. I must be losing my edge."

14158, "Hey, Kovacs, I'm thinking about using the condenser garden."

14159, "That's a good space. Wet, though. Really wet."

14160, "Kovacs, did you get that sheeting cut to size?"

14161, "You know I did."

14162, "Hahaha! Kovacs, are you serious? Is that really you?"

14163, "Sorry. I was playing with a retrofit.."

14164, "You should really see this proxy, Kovacs. It's a bad you."

14165, "I'll look. And I know you'll watch."

14166, "Let's practice on turbulence and shear."

14167, "Copy. I'll find a scenario."

14168, "How are you, al-Da'wa?"

14169, "I wonder what you hope to learn from these questions."

14170, "Are you excited for my little condenser garden affair?"

14171, "I am many things."

14172, "I want to be a Gef for a while."

14173, "I have proxies from Kukri Wing."

14174, "I don't need the bootstrap teleonomies, al-Da'wa."

14175, "Of course. Your own techniques will suffice."

14176, "Should we find someone for Laporte to mesh with?"

14177, "She prefers naturalistic meetings."

14178, "I'm very curious for your read, Vidaura."

14179, "She can hear us. But of course you know that."

14180, "Thank you for coming to see me."

14181, "It's the least I could do."

14182, "V, I'm moving those skills to 66, bc80."

14183, "I'll let my subconscious handle it. Thanks!"

14184, "<000000000000000000000000000000000>"

14185, "Thorn, you're bleeding noise."

14186, "I'm building profiles on Idun staff now."

14187, "Much appreciated!"

14188, "No, Falconer, I definitely will not."

14189, "But I've got such plans for that software!"

14190, "Falconer. You're on praxis review for this op."

14191, "Good."

14192, "Falconer, need your undercover experience on the Khanda deployment."

14193, "Excellent. Give me the review."

14194, "Falconer, I'm pulling your memories from the Kovacs assignment."

14195, "Have fun! I know I did!"

14196, "I'm nervous about this one. Am I allowed to be nervous?"

14197, "Hell no! And if you are, don't tell us!"

14198, "Falconer's baiting me again."

14199, "She won't trust you as an analyst until you prove you can't be distracted."

14200, "Hey, big man. Why do all the operators end up in the favela?"

14201, "It's a more dynamic space. More input. More challenge."

14202, "I just don't get it...why why why..."

14203, "Are you debugging? I thought CASSANDRA was self-correcting?"

14204, "Fuck it! It's impossible! I quit! Okay. Try again."

14205, "That's the spirit."

14206, "Lot of interesting material in the new Felinetics surveillance."

14207, "Hijacking that widget is the slimiest thing we do."

14208, "Why do I always see you as a mangrove?"

14209, "This is a forest to you. Your mind creates metaphors."

14210, "I'm too exhausted to handle socialization. Find someone to cover."

14211, "I have located a suitable replacement."

14212, "What if we could just remove the social impulse entirely..."

14213, "The architecture will not support total mission orientation."

14214, "I hate this stupid problem. How do I - oh."

14215, "Your unconscious heuristics are a vital resource to CASSANDRA, Thorn."

Sorry I blew you off, Ivan, but there was no way I was going to leave my ship unattended in the hands of these $g Simak $g Station clowns.

In spite of the ham-handed engineers, the Block 4 refit is going well on my end. The latest installation is a dedicated processor for the LIDAR suite - they tell me it can pick out hairline faults in Tev armor at ten kilometers. Wonders never cease.

I have a feeling we're not going to get to sit down for that staff dinner before we rotate back to the line again. Let's look on the bright side and call it an incentive to live through the next deployment.

If I can get a few hours, I may be able to shuttle over to $g Bowman tomorrow to inspect the $g Katana's new gear. I'll see you then."

14289, "$b FleetNet $b Document $b Service
$b Bowman $b Station $b Engineering
$b for $b the $b attention $b of $b Captain $b Ivan $b Genady, $b FG-3103 $b 'Katana'

The Block 4 $g Karuna is a wartime upgrade to the Federation's main battle frigate. Primary design work was conducted by Jupiter's $b Stormrider $b Systems, with collaboration by $b Saab $b Spaceframes. We are proud to report that the Block 4 upgrade on the $g Katana has been completed.

The Block 4 Karuna retains excellent anti-fighter defenses, particularly along its spine and flanks. Blind spots remain around the engine section and the stern.

Your ship's powerful drives have been supplemented with MHD thrusters that can help you accelerate rapidly, much like a fighter's afterburners. Use reverse thrust in combination with the MHD thrusters to avoid collisions.

You may put your ship's RCS thrusters in glide mode in order to make off-vector maneuvers."

14290, "As in previous blocks, four forward gauss cannons provide long-range direct-fire attack options. When you close to slugging distance, two heavy forward mass drivers grant corvette-killing firepower.

Four Apocalypse torpedo batteries in VLS configuration allow you to attack enemy warships even while you are maneuvering to avoid bombers.

Fire control can be handled through your retinal command system. You can set each battery to $y engage $y automatically, fire on your current main target ($y track $y mode), or fire on a designated secondary target ($y lock $y mode). Designate secondary targets by targeting them and then pulling the 'primary fire' trigger. Your HUD will track your current secondary target in the gunnery display.

The gunnery display lists your weapons and their current targets. You may scroll through it with the $y up$slashdown $y arrow keys on your command console, and make mode changes with the $y left$slashright keys.

Your ship's tactical suite has been expanded significantly."

14291, "Your ship's ECM gear has been updated with adaptive jamming software and high-throughput emitters. You may block enemy beam fire for an estimated 15 seconds. Beams already charging to fire will be unaffected. This ability is more effective against direct-fire beams than slash beams, and we expect the GTVA to harden their slash beams within 6-8 weeks.

Your ship's hull now includes a combat damage control system. Active polymer sealant will be pumped to damaged areas for thirty seconds, then charged with a powerful electrical current, organizing it into armor-mimetic plates.

The $g Katana's main bow guns can be hotloaded for a short time, massively increasing rate of fire. After a hotload, ship power and thermal systems will need time to recharge.

You have been issued one (1) improvised decoy. This shuttle can mimic the targeting signature of your warship, drawing GTVA fire. Save it for use against a dire threat. We expect these decoys to fail within 3-5 weeks."

14292, "We are optimistic that the Block 4 upgrade will allow Karuna frigates to more successfully engage the GTVA's paired-corvette battleteams. 

Your ship and its partner the $g Altan $g Orde will be cleared to return to the front in forty-eight hours. We look forward to your after-action reports, Captain Genady."

We made our rendezvous with the Altan Orde at a Bretonia installation in orbit of Callisto. I've deployed crews to pump as much active sealant aboard as possible. We're making field repairs, recharging our drives and preparing to join the main battle raging near Ganymede.

I just killed twenty-five thousand people. Innocent men, women and children. Families.

I tell myself again and again that it was necessary. In the moment, all I could think about was Simak Station as a Tev base, refueling and rearming the ships that are even now killing my comrades. But the fact remains that if it were not for my decision the people on that station would have lived.

I almost can't believe I did it. I know there are captains who wouldn't have. Mence. Sanai. Noble souls. 

Ellen - Captain Albani - once told me about an old Jovian superstition, from the days when our ancestors routinely spent lives to save their fledgling homes. If a habitat was cracked, you had to isolate the breached compartments right away, no matter who was inside. A lot of people were sacrificed that way.

They say that every time you sacrifice someone, you build up a debt to Fate - as if the people you killed for your own purposes, no matter how noble, are waiting to even the scales. Fate is patient, but eventually, she always comes to collect.

I'm not a religious man, though god knows Ellen has worked on me. But here's my prayer, Fate - such as it is.

Next time I have to make a call like this one, make sure my life is on the other side of the ledger. I never wanted to be a man who doesn't pay his debts."

Without reliable data from the Katana's telemetry or its onboard black boxes, we cannot accurately assess the circumstances that led to the frigate's destruction.

Firsthand accounts of the tactical situation provide multiple, contradictory accounts of events, including the following scenarios:

1) The Katana engaged the corvette Ania before it had destroyed the attacking bombers, and was subsequently overwhelmed and destroyed.

2) The Katana engaged the corvette Ania and was then blindsided by the Thalassa or incoming bombers, and failed to use its superior speed and weapons range to escape the trap. As an experienced captain, Genady should have known to keep his distance, utilize glide mode, and avoid becoming trapped between the two corvettes.

3) Captain Genady, perhaps due to unfamiliarity or mistrust, failed to utilize the abilities at his disposal as part of the Block 4 refit.

Without more reliable data, we cannot be certain which of these scenarios is correct."
