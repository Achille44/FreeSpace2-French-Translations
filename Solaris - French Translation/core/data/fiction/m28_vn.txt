SHOWICON kelly file="portrait_kelly" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "Commander, now that the formalities are out of the way I wanted to give you something more personal. Something that means more than ceremony." 7384 "28a-01"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "Thank you for selecting me as XO. Sincerely. It's not the promotion, or the position really. It's that the offer came from you. That...probably sounded a little strange but bear with me a moment." 7385 "28a-02"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "I've been on Aria since her commissioning, almost two years now. I've seen a lot of people come and go. I was given several chances to transfer to a larger ship, but Aria was special to me." 7386 "28a-03"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "The thing about these little ships is they've got quirks that you don't really see on the larger vessels. Aria's is freedom. If you let her, the corvette can bring out the best in you, so long as you're true to yourself." 7387 "28a-04"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "Cameron and Ellis meant well. They saw a loner with undeveloped social skills. It was frustrating to see. I kept telling Ellis that you needed validating, not fixing." 7388 "28a-05"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "I'm not a counselor, but part of manning ship's comms is knowing people. All your life it seems the world refuses to meet you halfway, like you're never good enough. You're trying to keep afloat on a raft held together with duct tape." 7389 "28a-06"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "You manage, for a while. Until it all disintegrates in an eruption of fear and rage. And then you disconnect, vowing that it'll never happen again." 7390 "28a-07"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "As CO, you've now got a chance to do things your way, and as XO I'll do what I can to make it work." 7391 "28a-08"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "Let me take the heat for you, it's part of the job description. Let go of others' expectations, and just do what you need to do." 7392 "28a-09"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "You're more than Aria's pilot now. You're Aria's, and Aria is yours. Whether you believe in fate or not, the universe gave you this remarkable opportunity. Make the most of it." 7393 "28a-10"
MSGXSTR "Kelly" 7383 "Right. Now that's out of the way, I'm forwarding copies of the day's reports. The XO can save you from others' expectations, but she can't save you from paperwork." 7394 "28a-11"

SHOWICON tierney file="portrait_tierney" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Commander. Work on HMS Aria proceeds well. Ladigue Dockyard estimates completion within the next 48 hours." 7395 "28a-12"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Aria's getting the final fitting of Eriksson's new ECM systems. Your corvette will be the aegis for Formidable's battlegroup during the Veil operation. I think there's some poetry in that." 7396 "28a-13"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "This is the capstone for years of ECM research, a requirement that had become more acute in recent weeks. We need this advantage if the situation calls for a direct engagement with Kakotchka's battlegroup." 7397 "28a-14"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Begin your final preparations. As soon as modifications are complete, the task group moves out. Preliminary mission briefings will be given tomorrow for senior command staff." 7398 "28a-15"

MSGXSTR "Cleghorn" 7292 "This will be a tight operation under close proximity to the gateway structure itself. The gateway's energy output masks any power readings from the mines, so Aria will have to close in to detect and remotely deactivate them." 7404 "28a-21"
