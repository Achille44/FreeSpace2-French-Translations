$b * $b Antares $b System
$b * $b 5/1/35

$b News $b From $b the $b Front

GTA High Command is pleased to report a major victory in our war against the Shivans.  A combined Terran-Vasudan task force crushed a massive buildup of Shivan forces in Antares, destroying the SD Demiurge and a large number of supporting cruisers and cargo depots.  With the removal of this nexus of activity, the Shivan armada has been fragmented into numerous smaller secondary fleets scattered throughout known space.  Victory over the Shivans, though far from imminent, appears to be in sight.

Both the GTA and the PVE are moving quickly to secure their positions and press the advantage.  The GTD Minnow has been deployed to Beta Cygni and Betelgeuse, while the PVD Hope is en route to Vasuda and Alpha Centauri.  The Krios, however, is returning to Antares to monitor Shivan behavior and investigate several pirate factions that have cropped up in the aftermath of the Shivan defeat."

8249, "$b The $b Deneb $b Incident

Terran Command has informed us that the escape pod recovery mix-up in Deneb was due to a breakdown in communications.  Misunderstandings and bureaucratic errors such as these have unfortunately plagued the GTI command structure ever since the loss of the GTD Legion several months ago.  Both the Repulse and the Krios were accidentally assigned to the same operation, and the Repulse arrived first.  The first escape pod landed in the Repulse's hangar bay, while the confused personnel on the second pod landed in the Krios.

After the Krios received confirmation of the Repulse's orders, the escape pod and its occupants were transferred to Beta Aquilae.  Terran Command has classified all official records pertaining to their proceedings on this subject."

8250, "$b The $b Einstein

In the absence of further information, the Krios is continuing to investigate the Einstein's appearance in the Deneb system.  According to service logs, the Einstein was reported destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128.  The Einstein had entered the system on a routine geological survey mission three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Deneb during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

8251, "$b The $b Einstein $b (continued)

Before its alleged destruction at Ross 128, the Einstein was under the command of Captain Ezra Tycho, a high-ranking GTI officer.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.

The appearance of the Einstein in such a highly secure region of space is troubling.  Analysis of the ship's flight pattern indicates that it was performing a high-level scan of the area in and around the Deneb asteroid belt.  The Einstein would be in an ideal position to observe and record the activities of all Vasudan research convoys in the area.

The purpose behind these scans, as well as any data the Einstein gathered, remain unknown.  Our brief interrogations of the Einstein's survivors yielded little useful information on this subject, as most of the command crew were aboard the escape pod retrieved by the Repulse."

8252, "$b New $b Shivan $b Technology: $b SB $b Seraphim

Recent engagements with Shivan forces have revealed the existence of a new class of bomber, which we have designated Seraphim.  The Seraphim appears to be similar to the Nephilim in most respects, except that it boasts an additional four primary hardpoints and its armament capacity is approximately 50% greater.  Like the Nephilim, the Seraphim is a formidable foe.  Pilots are advised to carry a heavy shield-damaging weapon, such as the Banshee, in theaters where these bombers are expected.

We are unsure as to why the Shivans waited until now to introduce the Seraphim.  Its deployment could have shifted the balance in a number of close engagements during the height of the Great War.  Now, however, the Shivans appear to lack the initiative to use it effectively."

8253, "$b New $b Technology: $b GTF $b Loki

Research and Development has completed field testing of its latest stealth fighter prototype, the GTF Loki.  Featuring high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability, the Loki is designed primarily as a reconnaissance fighter.  Its shielded reactor chamber and compact hull give it a low sensor profile, enabling it to elude detection by enemy forces.  Pursuant to regulations, the Loki's on-board IFF transponder will emit an encrypted signal to allow targeting by designated friendly units.

At this time, the Loki is restricted to GTI pilots only.  No pilot in the standard GTA fighter corps is to be authorized to fly the Loki until further notice."

8254, "At approximately 1500 hours today, the $f Talus $f Installation in Antares was attacked in a pirate raid.  While registered as a mining facility, Talus is in fact home to a particle accelerator and covert weapons and energy production research.  Whether the pirates knew this or not is uncertain, but the attack certainly did not go as planned."

8256, "Research Vessels"

8257, "Pirates"

8258, "GTC Leto"

8259, "Somehow, during the attack, a massive explosion occured when volitile materials breached containment.  All small craft in the vicinity, including the entire pirate force, was wiped out.  The only part of the station's defenses that survived the blast was the Leviathan cruiser $f Leto, which had been disabled in the initial raid."

8260, "Several damaged cargo containers litter the immediate area.  Due to the sensitivity of this cargo, the covert nature of the station's research, and the high probability of another pirate attack, the GTI is being sent in to oversee the cleanup operation.  This station has always been on the cutting edge of new research, and it must be secured for the benefit of future generations."

8261, "We have conscripted several $f Chronos freighters from civilian facilities in Beta Cygni.  These freighters will jump in, collect the cargo, and move it to a secure location.  Your primary objective is to ensure the safe recovery of this cargo."

8262, "Freighters"

8263, "Also, the structural integrity of Talus Station was compromised and it must be evacuated.  Since the docking bays have collapsed, the crew is using the $f Hermes escape pods.  We do not expect the pirates to be so callous as to fire on unarmed lifeboats, but their tactics are erratic at best.  Defend the pods if necessary."

8264, "Escape Pods"

8265, "We are organizing a repair crew for the $f Leto, which will then move into position near the station to deter any future attacks.  Once the Leto is in position and the cargo recovered, you may return to base. "

8266, "Be aware that these pirates have demonstrated considerable discipline.  Intel believes they are under the control of the local secessionist faction, calling themselves the $h Antares $h Federation.  While the GTA has done its best to keep them under control, this is their boldest action yet.

If these weapons fall into the wrong hands, millions of lives could be in jeopardy.  Under no circumstances are you to allow this to happen.  Dismissed."

8267, "Outstanding job, pilot.  Thanks to you every cargo container is accounted for, and the Talus and Leto are safe.  All the warhead materials have been recovered, and are being held at a secure facility until Talus can be reconstructed.  Technicians estimate the station will be back online and fully functional within the month. "

8268, "Your sensor logs indicate you were able to identify the pirate drones visually.  This attention to detail is what we look for in GTI officers, and you are to be commended."

8269, "Thanks to you, the station was saved, the Leto is repaired, and the cargo was carried off safely.  Unfortunately, not all the cargo containers were accounted for at the rendezvous point.  It is suspected that some of the freighters were pirate drones.  The contents of those containers was highly sensitive, and their loss is disturbing.  Local police forces are attempting to locate the pirates, but it is unlikely the stolen materials will be recovered."

8270, "Scanning the incoming freighters will verify their status.  Try to get them all before they jump out.  You might be able to spot the drones visually."

8271, "Talus Station was destroyed in the pirate raid.  Though damaged and defenseless, you should have been able to ensure its safety.  The facilities and research lost on the station will set back particle physics by a decade.  As GTI pilots, we expect nothing but the best from you, and your failure is inexcusable."

8272, "Destroy any bombers that target the station.  They shouldn't pose any serious threat."

8273, "The GTC Leto was destroyed in the pirate raid.  Command has ordered the Iapetus and Python to permanent security detail here, which means two fewer warships on the front lines.

This is a significant victory for the Antares Federation.  The Alliance cannot afford a civil war when the Shivans still control Terran space!  Your poor performance on this objective will be noted."

8274, "Ken wing's Athenas pose the greatest threat to the Leto while it is being repaired.  Keep an eye on its hull integrity after it has been repaired and help it if necessary."

8275, "Despite the pirate feint and the Shivan attack, you also ensured the safety of all the escape pods and their crew.  Your superior ability and concentration under fire have been duly noted.  Well done."

8276, "Don't leave the area until ordered."

Dismissed."

8702, "Your team also destroyed all escaping GTI craft.  Without that research, the rebels will not be able to rebuild their military.  Well done."

8703, "Unfortunately, this war isn't over yet.  The rebel juggernaut you encountered has been identified as a Terran-Shivan hybrid, possessing advanced weapons capable of annihilating one of our warships in a single shot.  We have designated this new class of destroyer 'Hades'.

We don't quite know what we're up against, but Command intends to find out."

8704, "Our forces have been routed by the GTI rebels.  Their advanced technologies have apparently won the battle, and now a destroyer of incredible proportions is headed towards our base.  Your failure today will likely collapse the Terran-Vasudan alliance and put the rebellion in charge."
