MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5603 "CDR ANIL CAMERON - HMS ARIA" 5895
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "Hello Lieutenant. Crown Command has need of your skills. You will report to myself as your operations manager for the next mission." 5897 "20a-01"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "Katherine Lau has accepted the terms of our contract of employment. I thought it prudent you receive a personalised briefing. You're still a King's Officer, half-pay leave or no." 5898 "20a-02"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "First, a summary of the strategic situation and how it relates to our upcoming operation." 5899 "20a-03"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "As you no doubt know, an unknown actor has been supplying the Malikans with high grade weapons, and setting them loose in Sulsia." 5900 "20a-04"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "It's clear the intent must have been to cripple the Sulsian Hegemony, and as a result undermine Commonwealth interests in the sector." 5901 "20a-05"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "We don't know exactly who's supplying them, but we believe high ranking officers within the Sinarus Combine are involved." 5902 "20a-06"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "The consequences have been severe. The Sulsian navy has been brought to its knees, and thousands of civilians in Sulsia have died at the hands of Andri Gadaria's militia." 5903 "20a-07"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "For his crimes against humanity, the Alban Commonwealth has answered the Sulsian Hegemony's call for assistance to bring Andri Gadaria to justice." 5904 "20a-08"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "Crown Command has identified two short-term goals in the Sulsian theatre. First is to apprehend or neutralise Gadaria." 5905 "20a-09"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "Second is to identify the individual responsible for arming Gadaria's terrorist group and gather evidence against them." 5906 "20a-10"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "The Alban Parliament is building a coalition against the Sinarus Combine. The more evidence we can bring to the table, the more support we can gather and the better we can offset the Combine's military power." 5907 "20a-11"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5896 "When war comes to the Commonwealth, we'll need all the advantage we can get." 5908 "20a-12"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "All right Ross, Meiks. Your former masters have hired us for an operation against the Sinarus Combine. I figure since we're already enemies with their rear admirals we might as well go all in." 5909 "20a-13"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "Commander Cameron's crew has finished their interrogation of Kendra. She doesn't know who her employer was but was able to give details of their intermediary." 5910 "20a-14"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "Through Kendra's information, the Albans have identified a convoy which could give clues to her employer's identity." 5911 "20a-15"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "The convoy contains three Sinarus-flagged freighters with a cruiser escort. Their destination is Guardador Station, a mining hub in Sulsia that was comandeered by the Malikans several days ago." 5912 "20a-16"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "The cargo manifest on those freighters mentions heavy mining equipment but the Albans believe they're shipping weapons under cover." 5913 "20a-17"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "The Albans want one of the freighters so they can dissect her cargo for clues. This is where we come in." 5914 "20a-18"

SHOWICON hoshi file="icon_corvetteold" text="Hoshikuzu" color="none" x=20 y=52 xstrid=3744

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "The Hoshikuzu will jump in just inside ASM range of the convoy and launch missile strikes against the convoy's escorts. The hope is that the Combine warships are lured into an engagement away from their charges." 5915 "20a-19"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "Once an opening is made, you need to disable the astrogation systems of one of the freighters. This is critical. We cannot commit the rest of our group until we're sure the freighters won't be able to make a run for it." 5916 "20a-20"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "Once this is done we'll call in the Nassau, Hopewell and the Aria to assault the Combine ships." 5917 "20a-21"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "This is going to be a balancing act. As long as the Combine think they're dealing with a solitary corvette, they'll be less inclined to warp out." 5918 "20a-22"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "One more thing you two should know. The Hoshi's drone bay got replaced by her ASM launcher, so you won't have any repair drones for the first part of the mission. Be careful out there." 5919 "20a-23"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5686 "I think that's it. Probably the most insane job I've ever accepted, but your Commander Cameron is paying us premium rates. It helps that I've got you two with me to help pull this through." 5920 "20a-24"
