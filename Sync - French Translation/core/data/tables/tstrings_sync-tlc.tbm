Probably the best course of action to take upon arrival would be to jump deeper into the system as soon as our subspace drives are recharged.

Somewhere out there is the rest of our team. We've got to find a friendly soon. With any luck, Persistence should be out searching for us, along with everyone else. I don't know where we are or what's going on, but I do know that I don't want to be here any longer."

6478, "Its communication systems are down, Alpha 3. It's possible the crew are still alive."

6479, "How the hell did they survive out here at all?"

6480, "I guess their disabled systems and the nebula made them practically undetectable."

6481, "I don't like it. This is all too... neat. We found a disabled transport, which somehow repairs its engines and leads us to the Farae. This has got to be some kind of trap."

6482, "I don't think so. The Vasudans were still attacking us."

6483, "They're not attacking the Qetesh, though. It's barely been hit at all."

6487, "Cut it out, pilots. We're getting some strange readings ahead. They... don't make sense. It says there's a jump node here, but at the same time the readings are far removed from any jump node I've ever seen."

6488, "What does that mean?"

6489, "It means if there really is a node here, then it shouldn't be possible. These readings... they're way off the scale. This node shouldn't even exist."

6490, "We've reached some kind of debris field. It's too dense for us to progress any further. Pilots, you'll have to follow the Qetesh in on your own."

6491, "Phi wing, if you get much more than two klicks into the field, return to guard the Persistence. I'm not risking getting jumped by the Vasudans while you're following that transport."

6493, "The nebula's interfering with our transmission. We're gonna have to go back. We're 2 klicks out anyway. We'll be back with instructions from the Persistence."

6499, "Well, the only reason I'm here is because someone needed to give you the order."

6506, "Damn. They must be using some weird shielding system that's tricking the scanners."

6507, "We'd better get back to the Persistence. You think you can find your way back here, Alpha 3?"

6509, "Right then. After you."

6510, "That's weird. Where's Qetesh and Farae?"

6511, "Okay, this place is getting really creepy. Let's get back to the Persistence."

6512, "Agreed."

6513, "Report. Did you find it?"

6514, "Roger, Persistence. The cargo is intact, and a nav buoy has been deployed. How are we going to pick it up, though?"

6515, "Why's it so important anyway? The Raikan is still out there. Some of the crew may still be alive!"

6516, "We don't have any way of boarding the Raikan. The Farae, on the other hand, is ours. We might be able to get the engines online if--"

6517, "The Farae is gone, Persistence. It vanished. So did the Qetesh."

6520, "Where the hell is the Farae, then?"

6540, "But something's different. The power readings we're getting from the drives are normal, but -something- in our immediate vicinity is giving off huge readings."

6541, "But right when we enter the portal, there's a massive fluctuation in the energy. I don't know what's causing it, but it seems to be the cause of this whole mess."

6542, "What about the Vasudans? Why were they there?"

6543, "You heard how they talked. They were... different. Not our Vasudans. They must be some distant cousin, or something... somehow they got separated from our Vasudans ages ago."

6547, "Well... can you use this malfunction to take us back to our own systems?"

6548, "We don't even know what's causing it yet, let alone how it happens. I've never seen such high energy readings. We'd never be able to achieve something like that in a million years."

Thank God Sarah's okay. Looks like we made it in time after all. The Vasudans spoke to us, although they didn't make much sense. Maybe they're related to the ones we encountered back in Betelgeuse..."

6554, "They had some kind of super destroyer. I'm just glad they didn't decide to use it against us. Once they'd finished their little speech, everyone jumped out at the same time again. I tried to stop it this time but failed. The system won't respond to any commands after the anomaly is detected.

The energy signature the Truth was talking about turned out to be some kind of huge portal. It's nothing like anything I've ever seen. It must have been made by some new species. Definitely not Terran or Vasudan, and it doesn't have the architectural properties of anything Shivan, either. At least not from what I've seen of them, which admittedly isn't all that much."

6596, "I'm convinced it's some kind of artificial jump node, or at least a device which can somehow alter naturally formed ones. It's created a node, certainly. We're travelling through it now. It must have taken years to build... probably been sitting here for even longer.

Beta 2 lost it right before we went through the jumpgate. What happened to him? And what's that Sync he was talking about? I guess Max was right. There must be something special in that cargo unit. But the Persistence seems as blind to it as we are."

I think there's something out there. It's not the Shivans that are our problem. They're just messengers. Messengers. And we wouldn't listen. We just ran away. They're always running away. Everyone runs."

7154, "I can feel it watching me. It's out there somewhere. Waiting. Sometimes it's so close I can't breathe. It's not a creature. Nothing like that could be alive. It's going to catch us and make us never exist. We've done this to ourselves. It's something that wants nothing. Everything to become nothing. And the Shivans are its messenger..."

7155, "That must have been a communication node of some sort."

They used us... They used Sync. We'd eluded them for so long, fought them back. But it wasn't enough, was it? They'd never stop. They'll always be hunting us. And in our naivety we have created a device of incredible power. A device they could use against us to create a direct link from their home systems to ours.

We are the architect of our own destruction.

But how did the Shivans know of Sync and its power? How did they know it was us that carried it? Why did the Farae not stop when the Shivans surrounded her? The question of why the Farae and the Qetesh followed us in our journey with not so much as a word remains unanswered, and the meaning behind the riddles spoken by the Vasudans continue to elude me.

Our journey has just begun."
