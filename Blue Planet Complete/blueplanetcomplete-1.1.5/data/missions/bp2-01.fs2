This is Admiral Byrne. Give me your ears.

I will be plain with you. The rumors you have heard are correct. 

After an eighteen-month stand, Jupiter has fallen to the $r GTVA. The Jovian Systems Republic issued an unconditional surrender at 2330. Admiral Calder's $f Third $f Fleet has been routed.

Alliance marines are now landing on Ganymede. The Jovian government, under threat of orbital bombardment, has agreed to cooperate.", 7347)

For now, know this. The GTVA has committed to total war.

At 0330 yesterday the front-line destroyers $r Atreus and $r Imperieuse, under $r Admiral $r Chiwetel $r Steele, transited the Delta Serpentis node. These ships and their battle groups carried out the attack on Jupiter at 0700. Steele himself personally captured $f Artemis $f Station, before scorched-earth protocols could be enacted.

By capturing Jupiter's gate network and civilian infrastructure intact, Steele has accomplished what $r Admiral $r Cyrus $r Severanti could not: he has given the GTVA the logistical footing for full-scale war.", 7348)

We have a more immediate task, however. $f Third $f Fleet's survivors need our help. At 2335, Fleet Admiral Calder issued the order for a full-scale retreat to Mars. Warships and strike craft from the $r Imperieuse and $r Atreus battle groups are pursuing these survivors, as well as any civilian convoys that have refused the no-fly order.

As $f Second $f Fleet $f Mars fends off raids from the $r Hood, $r Carthage, and $r Meridian, I will deploy our squadrons to cover the retreat of civilians and $f Third $f Fleet from Jupiter space.

Noemi, it's Brie.

You know what's happening out there. You've been trained, you've flown patrols. You're ready.

I want you to trust yourself. Yes, your psych profile makes you look like a lamb, and Kassim has his discipline issues, but the two of you have aptitude scores better than most of First Fleet. There's a reason I asked for you two in my wing.

You can fly like no one I've seen. Our Uhlans can match any fighter the Tevs have. The two of you will survive. And I've got a few tricks up my sleeve myself.

Captain Telfer is about to pass on our frag orders. Get to the ready room. If you need to throw up, do it before we launch.", 7351)
