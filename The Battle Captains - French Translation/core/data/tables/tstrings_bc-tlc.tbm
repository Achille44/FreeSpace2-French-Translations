16004, "GTVA Legion of Honor (2367), Citation Excerpt: Captain Anita Lopez, Galactic Terran Vasudan Alliance, distinguished herself by actions above and beyond the call of duty, on October 7th, 2367, while serving as Acting Commanding Officer of the GTD Carthage, GTVA Third Fleet, during the Nebula Campaign. Captain Lopez used the Carthage as a base of fire at the Knossos Jump Node, in the nebula, while subjected to heavy Beam Fire and anti-capital ship warheads from large numbers of Shivan craft."

16005, "$b October $b 7, $b 2367

Though the GTVA has overcome the NTF Rebellion, Aken Bosch's dream of a pact with the Destroyers has opened the Knossos portal in Gamma Draconis, and unleashed a second Shivan incursion on Terran and Vasudan space.

Buoyed by the destruction of the Sathanas juggernaut, GTVA Command sent its battlegroups charging into the nebula beyond Gamma Draconis, in the hope that a sustained offensive could break the back of the Shivan war effort. But the destruction of the GVD Psamtik by a second Sathanas has proved that against the Destroyers, there could be no victory$semicolon only, perhaps, a reprieve from annihilation.

Shivan ships now flood into the Nebula, forcing a massive strategic withdrawal. Allied ships race for home. The GTD Carthage, flagship of the Terran 3rd Fleet's 2nd Battlegroup, has withdrawn to the Gamma Draconis node under heavy fire. Its escort has been slaughtered, and Admiral Christie, the battlegroup's CO, lies on the border between life and death. Captain Anita Lopez, the Carthage's well-respected XO, takes field command . . ."

16006, "$b ATTN: $b OPERATIONS $b ROOM $b STAFF, $b GTD $b CARTHAGE
$b FROM: $b CAPTAIN $b ANITA $b LOPEZ

After having reviewed the logs from the Supply Depot Kappa engagement, I commend the entire Operations Room staff on keeping cool under fire. If you hadn't worked around our power outages, and coordinated that barrage on the SCvs Cagnazzo and Rubicante, we might have lost the Warspite.

I knew it was a gamble, but I couldn't raise Admiral Christie, and I was confident that Delta and Epsilon could keep the bombers off us. Even if we lost the opportunity to kill a destroyer by deviating from the battle plan, that maneuver kept our men alive and our ships fighting. That's always a win in my book."

16007, "$b CAPTAIN'S $b REFERENCE
$b GTD $b CARTHAGE $b (DD-52)
$b TACTICAL $b SUMMARY

The GTD Orion Flight II-ETC remains the premier battleship of the Galactic Terran Navy, mounting the heaviest beam cannon battery of any purely Terran-designed warship. With a standard strikecraft complement of eight squadrons, it remains an effective fleet carrier.

The Orion is equipped with an Energy Transfer System, allowing you to shift power between the ship's weapons and engines as the situation dictates.

Your Tactical Air Control System delivers context-sensitive attack orders - order your strikecraft to attack most Shivan capital ships, and they will automatically disarm the target's main beam cannons before destroying it."

16008, "The Orion's anti-capital battery consists of three 'Crypt Hammer' heavy beam cannons, and three 'Forge Eagle' slash beam cannons. They are mounted in broadside configuration, besides a single Crypt Hammer in a chin turret. These beams have a range of 4 km. (In Manual Fire or Overload modes, your beam range is measured at 5 km on your lower-left rangefinder, due to unusual power distribution.)

You can set your beams to $y fire $y manually when you press $b Left $b CTRL on your console, $y engage $y automatically, fire on your current main target $y(track $y mode), or fire on a designated secondary target $y(lock $y mode). Designate secondary targets by targeting them and then pulling the 'primary fire' trigger. Your HUD will track your current secondary target in the gunnery display.

To toggle between Manual Fire and the three automatic modes, press $b Alt-X on your console. To toggle between the individual automatic modes, press the $b Left and $b Right keys.

The Orion also mounts a weak anti-strikecraft battery of 7 laser turrets and 3 AAA beams. These weapons are primarily placed to cover the Orion's dorsal and ventral arcs, so take especial caution against bomber attacks on the horizontal plane. As your defensive battery is too weak to fend off a heavy bomber attack, you must rely on your interceptor wings for anti-strikecraft defense. Your anti-fighter weapons are all automated."

16009, "$b ADDENDUM

The GTD Carthage mounts nonstandard upgrades to its ETS, giving it four alternate energy-transfer modes, to be used according to tactical exigency.

Pressing $b 1 on your console will overcharge your main beams for a single overloaded volley. The plasma cores will require 30 seconds to charge, temporarily taking all your beams and turrets offline$semicolon your beams will automatically fire on your target once they are fully charged.

Press $b 2 to transmit detailed targeting telemetry to your strikecraft wing. Your entire air wing will benefit from enhanced fire control and avionics for 20 seconds$semicolon your systems will take 15 seconds to cycle afterwards.

Press $b 3 to channel more plasma to your engines, temporarily mimicking a strikecraft's afterburner. You will have 10 seconds of afterburner power, but your engines will take 20 seconds to recover from the stress.

Press $b 4 to boost the Carthage's ECM protection, disrupting enemy precision targeting and reducing incoming damage for 20 seconds. Your capacitors will need 15 seconds to cycle after each jamming pulse."

16010, "This is Acting Captain Lopez to all crew. We have arrived safely at the node, and all main systems are still operational. Damage control is still underway.

We have $f four $f wings in the air. $f Alpha and $f Beta Artemis $f tac $f bombers are fully-loaded with Maxims, Tempests, and Cyclops$semicolon we'll be relying on them to destroy $h Shivan $h capital $h ships while disarming their beam cannons, but they're still capable interceptors in a pinch. $f Gamma and $f Delta Perseus $f interceptors are flying CAP and space superiority. Six more wings are repairing heavy damage, and will be launched as soon as they are ready.

Unfortunately, as you may be aware, $f Admiral $f Christie fell into a coma during the attack. Therefore, I am taking command of the $f Carthage and all remaining $f 6th $f Battlegroup units."

At 0712 hours, the $f Aquitaine and $f Admiral $f Petrarch transited the node after sustaining heavy damage from $h Shivan attack.

It is critical that we withdraw as many ships and crews through the node as we can. The $h Shivans are in hot pursuit$semicolon we have confirmation of multiple $h destroyer $h battlegroups and $h hunter-killer $h teams pursuing retreating $f Allied $f forces, but no confirmed $h juggernauts as of yet."

The $f Allied tac-net is in severe disarray, and the strategic situation is in flux, so $f Allied and $h Shivan ETAs are unreliable. All incoming ships have been instructed to arrive near the $f nav $f plotter $f beacon, but be advised that some ships may misjump away from the beacon."

16022, "We know that units of the $f Terran $f 5th and $f 13th $f Battlegroups, the $f Vasudan $f 3rd and $f 7th $f Battlegroups, and various $f scattered $f units are withdrawing in heavy disarray. They are retreating under fire from $h Shivan destroyer $h battlegroups, $h cruiser and $h corvette $h hunter-killer $h teams, $h bomber $h strikes$semicolon everything in the $h Shivan playbook short of $h juggernauts. We'll have to play this one by ear, gentlemen. $f Command won't be sending us any reinforcements, so we'll have to make do with available resources.

We will deal with each new tactical situation as it arises, by employing the $f Carthage's abilities and its $f CAG in concert. Our $f air $f wing's been taking a beating, so we'll need to carefully use and conserve every $f strikecraft.

I know you're all terrified$semicolon I am too. But I promise you that we'll make it out alive, and that we'll save as many good men and women as we can.

Lopez out."

16028, "With Captain Lopez's death, the Alliance lost one of its finest officers, and one of its finest future battlegroup commanders.

Fifteen years later, when Admiral Steele was preparing his trap for the UEF Wargods battlegroup, he was forced to use a lesser commander as bait. In the ensuing fiasco, Steele lost both the GTD Vengeance and the GTD Imperiuse. This disaster turned Steele's planned masterstroke into a major reversal of fortune in Sol$semicolon the GTVA was forced into a humiliating retreat by Calder's aggressive counterattacks, collapsing the Sol node behind them under the faked pretext of a third Shivan Incursion. All because Anita Lopez never fired that crucial shot over Neptune, which changed the course of the war . . ."

16029, "Remember to use the Carthage's weapons, your fighter and bomber wings, and your special abilities in concert. Use ECM Boost (4) to reduce incoming beam and bomb damage when you can. When you have the opportunity, use your bomber wings and their Maxims to de-beam Shivan capital ships before attacking them head-on with your beams."

16030, "Unless you protect at least two of the Lubeck, Minuano, and Pylos, you cannot advance.

To protect the Lubeck and Minuano, charge forward and destroy the Jezebel with your beams (use the Thruster Boost ability.) To protect the Pylos, send Gamma and Delta wings to escort it."

16031, "Unless you protect at least half of the convoy, you cannot advance.

Send your fighters to protect the convoy against the bomber wings, and send your bombers to do as much damage to the Rakshasas as possible before they can get in range of the convoy. Charge the cruisers with the Carthage if the convoy is suffering heavy damage."

16032, "Unless you protect the Cyntherea, you cannot advance.

Charge at the hunter-killer group attacking the Cyntherea, and hit them with all your firepower and strikecraft. Use ECM Boost (4) to reduce the damage you take from the capital ships' beam fire.

When the Chemosh arrives, immediately start blasting it with manual beam fire. You've got no time for tactics$semicolon it's a damage race between your two capital ships and the Chemosh."

16033, " . . . . You must've deliberately failed the mission to get this debrief stage. There's no other way you could've died this early.

My Little Pony, My Little Pony,
I used to wonder what friendship could be,
Until you all shared its magic with me!
Big adventures, tons of fun,
A beautiful heart, faithful and strong,
Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat,
And magic makes it all complete!
You're all my very best friieeeends!"

16034, "Don't charge headlong at the Rakshasa group. Let your bombers pick away at them before they get in beam range. Use ECM Boost (4) to reduce damage from their beams."

16035, "Use your fighters to tie up the Apollyon's fighter cover, then send in your bombers to strip away its beam cannons. Use Overload Beams (1) to blast the Apollyon with a well-timed salvo, or ECM Boost (4) to reduce damage from its beam cannons."

16036, "Defend yourself from the TAG spotters with both of your fighter wings and CAG Telemetry (2), then destroy the TAG Cains with bombers and$slashor beam fire."

16037, "When defending the Cyntherea from the hunter-killer group, use ECM Boost (4) to reduce the damage you take from beam fire. Every point of hull integrity you save here will help against the Chemosh.

When the Chemosh arrives, immediately start blasting it with manual beam fire. You've got no time for tactics$semicolon it's a damage race between your two capital ships and the Chemosh."

16038, "Defend yourself and the Vasudan corvettes from the TAG spotters with all of your wings and CAG Telemetry (2)."

16039, "Defend yourself and the Vasudan corvettes from the TAG spotters with all of your wings and CAG Telemetry (2). The more hull integrity you preserve against the TAG spotters, the better a chance you'll have against the Ravanas and their air wings.

When the enemy wings attack your gunline, have all your wings clear them out with Engage Enemy (C-3-9). When the Termagant closes to attack you, then attack it with your bombers, to destroy its main beams. Use Overload Beams (1) to blast the Termagant with a well-timed salvo, or ECM Boost (4) to reduce damage from its beam cannons.

If you protect the Sobeks from the initial Shivan attacks, their overloaded beam salvo should destroy the Mammon for you."

16040, "For holding the Nebula-Gamma Draconis node open for eighty-five minutes, saving tens of thousands of Allied lives, and showing excellent tactics and performance under pressure, Captain Anita Lopez was awarded the GTVA Legion of Honor, the highest decoration which the Security Council could bestow.

The Carthage came back a crippled warship$semicolon she was eventually refitted into a Combat Evaluation technology testbed, and returned to active duty years after Capella. Lopez and her beloved destroyer still had more battles to fight together.

Lopez herself, due to psychological reasons and Fleet politics, received a transfer back to the 2nd Officer Academy on Delta Serpentis, sitting out the final days of the Incursion. In 2372, she took command of the 2nd Battlegroup, reuniting with her beloved Carthage.

When the GTVA invaded Sol, Lopez faithfully served her government's cause, and served with distinction over the fourteen months of Severanti's grinding campaign of attrition. When Admiral Steele used her as bait for his trap for the Wargods, she held her position, and protected her men. When Admiral Calder and a vengeful Noemi Laporte came to take back Neptune, she held her position, and tried to protect her men, but this risky holding action would be her last . . ."

16041, "Captain Lopez defeated the Shivans by being a DIRTY, DIRTY, CHEATING CHEATER. You CHEATER. The ponies would be ashamed of you."

16042, "If the mission was too hard, then go back to the release thread and slap Lepanto in the face for bad balancing. Or blame Battuta or TheHound$semicolon they beta-tested for me, so I'll try to offload some of the blame onto them.

If you're just lazy, then just read this debrief and be ashamed of yourself.
Of course, I've never ever cheated on a FS mission myself - hey, what are you looking at me like that for?"

16455, "Commander Cyrus Severanti fends off the NTF attack on Luzon Station while covering its evacuation, despite suffering personal injuries."

16456, "$b April $b 4, $b 2366

The Neo-Terran Front Rebellion has dragged on for nearly a year. The Lost Generation's anti-Vasudan hate and blame, which Aken Bosch whipped into a storm of fury, continues to ravage GTVA space. Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius continue to produce NTF warships, crewed by the eager youth of the Lost Generation, which are hurled into battle against the Alliance across multiple fronts. The Rebels are unaware that they are merely puppets in Bosch's grand, mad scheme to save humanity by forging an alliance with the Shivans, but they eagerly kill Terran and Vasudan soldiers and civilians alike, all the same.

The Alliance battles the NTF in Alpha Centauri, Deneb, Vega, and Epsilon Pegasi. After an initial series of costly battles around the NTF home systems, the war has largely devolved into a stalemate. Neither side is willing to risk a major offensive, and risk losing everything$semicolon most fighting is limited to probes and raids. The Security Council has repeatedly proposed cease-fires, which the NTF has abused to recover its strength and launch covert attacks.

Cyrus Severanti, captain of the 6th Fleet's GTCv Steadfast, is already a stalwart commander and veteran of months of war. The 6th is assigned to the Epsilon Pegasi theater, against the NTF's own 6th Fleet, which has recently fallen under the command of the fiery Rear Admiral Koth. Koth has launched a series of probing attacks at the GTVA's scattered holdings in the system. Admiral West, the GTVA 6th Fleet's CO, is worried that Koth is planning a major offensive, and has dispatched ships to reinforce poorly-defended Allied holdings . . ."

16457, "$bFrom: $b cseveranti2@6flt.navy.mil
$b To: $b gwest5@6flt.navy.mil
$b Subject: $b Re: $b Your $b performance $b evaluation

Admiral,

You are most kind. During these months, I have resolved to do my duty as a corvette captain, but I feel honored that you would consider recommending me for fast-track promotion. You have been a most generous patron, Sir.

Frankly, I am amazed that Admiral Koth was ever given a theater command. His tactics are unduly aggressive, especially his frequent attacks with his flagship. His fleet, and the NTF as a whole, are losing the war of attrition. Even if Bosch has the operational genius of a Robert E. Lee, as long as we play Grant and grind the Rebels down under our superior numbers and industrial might, our eventual victory is assured. You know me, Sir$semicolon I simply cannot abide commanders taking foolish gambles.

On a lighter note, the Steadfast's maintenance has finished. The ETS is working at peak efficiency, and my Chief Engineer has devised some new power-distribution programs. My ship stands ready to fight, Admiral.

Yours,
Cpt. Cyrus Severanti"

16458, "$b CAPTAIN'S $b REFERENCE
$b GTCv $b Steadfast $b (CV-73)
$b TACTICAL $b SUMMARY

The GTCv Deimos is an effective multirole combatant, protected by modern molybdenum armor, and mounting weaponry capable of engaging all classes of hostile vessels.

The Deimos is equipped with an Energy Transfer System, allowing you to shift power between the ship's weapons and engines as the situation dictates."

16459, "The Deimos's main anti-capital weapons systems are its four 'Forge Eagle' slash beam cannons$semicolon two are mounted in the nose, and one on each side of the vessel. These beams have a range of 4 km.

You can set your beams to $y fire $y manually when you press $b Left $b CTRL on your console, $y engage $y automatically, fire on your current main target $y(track $y mode), or fire on a designated secondary target $y(lock $y mode). Designate secondary targets by targeting them and then pulling the 'primary fire' trigger. Your HUD will track your current secondary target in the gunnery display.

To toggle between Manual Fire and the three automatic modes, press $b Alt-X on your console. To toggle between the individual automatic modes, press the $b Left and $b Right keys.

The Deimos also mounts 10 laser turrets, 6 flak cannons, 4 AAA beams, and 2 Piranha missile launchers. These weapons are primarily placed to cover the Deimos's side, ventral, and stern arcs$semicolon if you are attacked by enemy bombers from ahead or from the top, maneuver into a more favorable firing arc. Your anti-fighter weapons are all automated."

16460, "$b ADDENDUM

The GTCv Steadfast mounts nonstandard upgrades to its ETS, giving it three alternate energy-transfer modes, to be used according to tactical exigency.

Pressing $b 1 on your console will start overcharging your main beams to fire a single overloaded volley. The plasma cores will require 30 seconds to charge, temporarily taking all your beams and turrets offline$semicolon once charging is complete, your overloaded beams will fire on your target.

Press $b 2 to fire a heavy jamming burst. All enemy ships in the battlespace will lose fire control and avionics for 20 seconds$semicolon your capacitors must cycle for 10 seconds afterward.

Press $b 3 to channel more plasma to your engines, temporarily mimicking a strikecraft's afterburner. You will have 20 seconds of afterburner power, but your engines will take 15 seconds to recover."

16461, "Looks like $h Koth's finally making a move. Our scout wings have detected an $h NTF $h strike $h force mobilizing at the $h Polaris $h node beachhead. We are unsure of their intended target, but $f Luzon $f Station, in Orbital Sector 137 of Epsilon Pegasi V, is too vulnerable to be left uncovered. Therefore, Commander, you are ordered to deploy the $f Steadfast to $f Luzon, and prepare for defensive action. You will be supported by $f Luzon's four onboard $f fighter $f squadrons, which should be sufficient to repulse any expected attack. All other operational $f 6th $f Fleet units are being kept in reserve to counter other potential $h NTF attacks."

Between the $f Steadfast, the Luzon $f defense $f fighters, and the $f 341st, $f Luzon should be able to repel any assault force under battlegroup strength.

Should the $h NTF attack with overwhelming force and $f Luzon $f Station be in critical danger, it will be evacuated in accordance with General Order 22. If this occurs, you are ordered to cover the $f evacuation $f transports' exit pattern. $f Luzon $f Station is manned by over 12,000 military and civilian personnel. Their safety is a high priority, especially the civilians'.

The NTF attack did heavy damage to Luzon Station, crippling GTVA efforts in Epsilon Pegasi.

Over a decade later, when the GTVA declared war on the United Earth Federation, Admiral Chiwetel Steele was quickly appointed to supreme command in the Sol theater. Without Severanti's grinding fourteen-month campaign to wear the UEF down, or the TEI ships which would enter service in the near future, the ambitious Steele overplayed his hand, and the GTVA took heavy losses in a failed Blitz on Earth . . ."

16470, "To stop the NTF cruisers from firing on the evac ships, move in close enough to distract them. To stop the fighters, move in and engage them with your AAA. Proper positioning, and use of the Deimos's capabilities, is key."

16471, "For his heroic defense of Luzon Station on April 4, 2366, and for staying in command of the Steadfast despite heavy personal injury, Captain Cyrus Severanti was awarded the Order of Galatea.

With Luzon Station intact, the GTVA could hold Epsilon Pegasi without needing to reroute forces from other theaters.

Between his wartime achievements and his connections in GTVA high command, Severanti would rise in rank over the ensuing years.

Over a decade later, when the GTVA invaded the United Earth Federation, Severanti would take supreme command of the Sol theater. Thanks to his slow, attrition-based strategy, the war would drag on for eighteen months, before the mounting impatience of his political masters pressured him into the foolish gamble of attacking Luna. After nearly losing his flagship to a UEF counterattack, he was ignominiously relieved of command, and rotated back home. His war of attrition did succeed in depleting UEF logistical assets, and rendered Sol more vulnerable to his successor, the more aggressive Admiral Steele . . ."
