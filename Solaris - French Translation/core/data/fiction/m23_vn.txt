MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Stuart. I guess this is it." 7215 "23a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The paperwork's been finalised. I've released you from the Hoshikuzu's employee list." 7216 "23a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I wish we could have kept this going for longer. It really felt like we were starting to hit our stride." 7217 "23a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Easy for me to say I suppose. I've never had to swear an oath to anyone, especially not to a King." 7218 "23a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I suppose you'll be staying in Sulsia doing your Commonwealth business. I'm taking everyone to the Aryavarta Subah to pick up further security jobs. No guilt this time, Sulsia's in better hands now." 7219 "23a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I hope you get a chance to make it up with Caitlyn. She sounds like the sort of person you need to hold on to. We all need to take care of each other out here, and you need to take care of yourself too." 7220 "23a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Well, I guess I'll see you round. If you find some time away from your Fleet in the future, come find me." 7221 "23a-07"

SHOWICON tierney file="portrait_tierney" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "I'm Captain Tierney, Admiral Cleghorn's 2IC and CO of HMS Royal Oak." 7224 "23a-08"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Admiral Cleghorn has ordered your reinstatement to full pay, effective immediately. You'll be attached to my carrier's roster. Welcome back to the Fleet." 7225 "23a-09"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "After reviewing Commander Cameron's reports of your actions in Sulsia, the admiral has approved your promotion to Lieutenant Commander. May you continue to serve His Majesty's Navy with dedication." 7226 "23a-10"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "I expect you've got questions. Your clearance level has been escalated accordingly, and I'll give you what you need to know." 7227 "23a-15"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Fifth Expeditionary Squadron is the Commonwealth contribution to the Sulsian Combined Task Force. The other element - a Jacobine Republique battle group - is on its way." 7228 "23a-12"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "His Majesty's naval assets are supporting ANI's operations in the region. The unrest in Sulsia is a second order consequence of the presence of the Veil artifacts. Securing these artifacts is Fleet's primary objective for this theatre." 7229 "23a-16"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "We now know the ghost station you encountered was a Combine research base to study the alien technology. This explains how they were able to develop their own version of Solaris so quickly." 7230 "23a-17"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Crown HIGHCOM's overarching objective is to stop the Combine's Solaris weapon. Securing the Veil station is crucial to this. Neutralising the Combine forces in Sulsia is a preliminary objective." 7231 "23a-18"
MSGXSTR "Tierney" 7223 "Your first posting will be aboard HMS Aria as her attending pilot. Aria is being redeployed for a special assignment. I'll let Commander Cameron brief you on the specifics." 7232 "23a-11"

SHOWICON qship file="icon_civmissilefrigate" text="Nashira" color="none" x=70 y=25 xstrid=5223
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "This is a covert operation to get our forces in range to Vicare station unopposed. The lynchpin of this attack is the minelayer Nashira, a modified Carthage freighter. The Malikans have employed similar warships in the past." 7241 "23a-26"
SHOWICON player file="icon_fighterold" text="Ross" color="none" x=70 y=45 xstrid=3333
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "Playing the part of a Malikan supply convoy, you and Nashira are to move into position close to Thresher. To complete the deception, you'll be flying a repurposed Mace fighter for this mission." 7242 "23a-27"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "This operation hinges on redistributing the Vicare garrison prior to moving against our primary target. A distraction force will simulate a navigation transponder error by arriving at range to the station." 7243 "23a-28"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "The aim is to force the Combine garrison into committing security assets to cover multiple angles of approach. The navigation error will also provide a credible explanation for Nashira's approach." 7244 "23a-29"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "Once in position, Nashira will launch a combined EMP and HE attack to cripple the cruiser. Even if not outright destroyed, this will neutralise Thresher for a significant period." 7245 "23a-30"
MSGXSTR "Cameron" 4908 "This operation is the culmination of weeks of planning. The viability of future Commonwealth operations in Sulsia rests on a successful outcome." 7246 "23a-31"
