MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5040 "CDR ANIL CAMERON - HMS ARIA" 5324

MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "Lieutenant Ross. My congratulations on your victory at Jotram Station. The entire operation was a risk but Bertini was never a man of temperance." 5364 "22a-01"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "The strategic situation in Sulsia remains volatile. We've received word that the Children of Renewal congregation is heading for the Pallavian Veil via Sulsian space." 5365 "22a-02"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "We believe this is one reason why the Malikans have halted their advance and pulled back. We're unsure how the Children of Renewal prompted this, as they have no military capacity to threaten Gadaria." 5366 "22a-03"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "Admiral Cleghorn has authorised a light unit detachment to shadow the Renewal congregation. Due to the proximity of the Veil to Sulsia, we need to identify any possible threats to future Commonwealth operations here." 5367 "22a-04"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "I want your ships with me. Our task is to escort the Renewal convoy to it's destination and discover their intentions there." 5368 "22a-05"
MSGXSTR "CAMERON" 5325 "Your Katherine Lau already has a professional relationship with Reverend Lightowler on Covenant, and I plan to take full advantage of this." 5369 "22a-06"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "I've contacted Reverend Lightowler. He's given us the coordinates of the Renewal's final destination. It's deep within the Pallavian Veil, off of all major cartographical charts." 5370 "22a-07"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "This is the location of the Children of Renewal's 'Promised Land'. They're making the final journey with their entire contingent." 5371 "22a-08"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "I've checked our long range sensors. There's a black hole orbiting a K-type star, but no detectable planets or other system bodies. Lightowler assures me the coordinates correspond to high orbit of an Earth-like planet." 5372 "22a-09"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "It's possible the black hole or the Veil itself is confounding our long range sensors. If there is a planet out there, we might not be able to see it." 5373 "22a-10"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "The Children of Renewal have shared their space charts with us. If we need to make our way out without Covenant, we'll be able to use their navigation data." 5374 "22a-11"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "I suspect this is the last job that the Renewal are offering us. Lightowler's offering an astronomical payment for this job, enough for me, Navo and Badami to retire comfortably and the rest of our group to receive a generous payout." 5375 "22a-12"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5104 "I don't know if this 'Promised Land' is real. I suppose it doesn't matter. It's real enough to the Children of Renewal and that's good enough for my conscience." 5376 "22a-13"

MSGXSTR "MEIKS" 5378 "Tae be honest a didn't expect this work tae be so intense. Thought it wid be a easy job tae win down 'til retirement." 5380 "22a-15"
MSGXSTR "MEIKS" 5378 "It didn't turn out so bad I suppose. Managed to make a difference out here. Showed the Combine a thing or two about messin wi the Commonwealth didn't we?" 5381 "22a-16"
MSGXSTR "MEIKS" 5378 "Anyway, a think this is the end for me lad. My fighting days are done. The cocktail hangovers are getting rougher an lasting longer. They say your body lets you know when it's had enough and mine's shouting at me pretty damn loud." 5382 "22a-17"
MSGXSTR "MEIKS" 5378 "Don' let my retirement bring ye down wi me. Ye've got a good future in the navy ahead of ye lad. Command never interested me but a can tell ye've got the knack for it. Ad be surprised if they don't give ye yer own squadron soon." 5383 "22a-18"
