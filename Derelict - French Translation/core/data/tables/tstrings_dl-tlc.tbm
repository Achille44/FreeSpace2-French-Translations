The D.H. variant is faster and more maneuverable than the standard Artemis bomber, at no cost to armor or armament. During the OpEval period, Artemis D.H. bombers are being deployed in only select squadrons in different theatres of the war. If the evaluation trials go well, wider deployment of the Artemis D.H. class is expected."

Five years have passed since the jump nodes to the Capella system were collapsed, sealing off a massive wave of Shivan juggernaughts and preventing them from pushing further into GTVA space. The supernova and subsequent nebula hang like a growing scar throughout the GTVA as light from that event continues to spread across our worlds."

4535, "The Ripple Effect

The loss of Capella created serious economic hardship throughout the Alliance - a new Great Depression is upon us. The complete loss of the planetary resources and economic foundation of a rich world was devastating in its own right, but that is not all. Two hundred million refugees continue to walk the stars, seeking a new home. Some have settled, while others have been forced to move from place to place, hoping that the next place may welcome them with open arms."

4536, "The Fall of Reason

While the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance continues to hold, the current depression has given way to political instability. Local governments rise and fall as often as lunar tides, organized crime and piracy have prospered in a black market environment. It seems no one is immune. Radical voices are raising echoes not heard since the blood cries of the Neo-Terran Front. The ghosts of the past are catching up with us."

4537, "Response of the Alliance

Since collapsing the Capella jump nodes, the recovering GTVA fleets have spent much of their time and resources in police actions. Our own resources are taxed to the limit, and yet still we have the courage to live up to our calling. Even so, it is alarming that there are those who are starting to take matters into their own hands."

Fortnight Update

I trust you are settling in well, pilot, now that you have been with us for more than two weeks. To be honest, aside from the recent excitement with the Blackbeard pirate raid near the Station, not much else happens out here. You're about to get a taste of the less exciting parts of life in the boondocks. Unfortunately, I am not much for motivational speeches, especially when we have work that needs to be done. 

Welcome to Deep Patrol duty. You can thank me later."

4614, "Tau Sigma Wildernesse

While Tau Sigma has been settled as a mining colony for over fifteen years, very little of the system has been marked for navigation. As a result, there are many hazardous regions of the star system that require navigational beacons, to ensure safe passage in these areas. Until now, only a small number of beacons have been set around the system. They mark the critical commercial lanes, particularly near the mining operations. However, GTVA Command informs us that in the coming months, the traffic to Tau Sigma will increase significantly. There is a need to step up the schedule of navigational beacon deployment.

Report to briefing for your specific assignment."

4615, "With a recent shipment of $b Mark $b IV $b Pharos-Class navigational systems, we are ready to proceed with their deployment as soon as possible. Your $b Myrmidon fighters are being modified to carry several of these beacons. They will become available to deploy under your control when you reach the designated area for that marker. In order to make room to carry these navigation beacons, your primary weapons have been limited, and your secondary banks have been reduced in capacity."

4616, "Due to the length of this mission, you and your wingmates will be flying in shifts. You will take turns sleeping as you make your patrol rounds. While asleep, your navigation systems will be locked into your wingmates'. In the event of any danger, you will be automatically alerted, and your systems brought online."

4617, "Each fighter wing has been assigned to lay markers in three different locations in the star system. $f Alpha, your task is simple. In each designated area, you are to make a clean sweep, noting any hazards, and dropping the navigational beacons in their appropriate area. Your onboard computer will automatically determine the best location for deployment, marking it with a $b computer-generated $b Pharos beacons on your HUD."

Once this is all over, we hope to make $b Tau $b Sigma much more accessible to those wishing to develop this region. "

4621, "On the first leg of your patrol, you will be placing beacons near an ice-belt further out of system. If we are lucky, these beacons may be able to use the reflective surfaces of the ice-belt to amplify their own scanning range. Once you successfully place the beacons, your computer will automatically download the next stage of your mission. Despite your remote location, you are still well within communication range of $f Tau $f Sigma $f Station. $g Command will be monitoring your progress.

Now, down to business... We seem to have encountered a situation at your next destination. Two Morgan Mining freighters have jumped in too close to the asteroid field you're about to mark. Lack of navigational data is proving to be a liability.

They have also picked up some transmissions from within the belt - it seems like you're flying into a pirate ambush. Be on your guard. While you will still lay the navigational buoys, your first task will be to guard the freighters by elminating any pirates, and  clearing a path for them through the asteroid field.

5052, "Personal Log: Governor Raymond Francis M'kembe
Date: November 13, 2372

It has been just over five years since the largest exodus humanity has ever seen. Towards the end of the Neo-Terran Front rebellion, an ancient portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system. It had been activated by the NTF, opening the doorway to another confrontation with the Shivans. 

In our arrogance, we thought we had learned from our experience thirty-two years ago. Nietzche once said, 'That which does not kill us, makes us  stronger.' We believed him. Our trust in our technology and our alliances made us overconfident. We assumed we could overcome any obstacle, and that nothing could stand in our way. When the Shivans came again, we thought, like Jerusalem of old, that our walls would never fall."

5053, "But the prophets cried out, warning of doom on the horizon. We ignored them, believing the lie that we had made for ourselves. The lesson, like the universe, was harsh, and we had forgotten it. We forgot that we had paid the price with our homeworlds. We were cut off from Sol and Earth, Vasuda Prime had been laid waste. Scattered across many systems, our colonies became our havens, because we had little choice. Terran, Vasudan, we walk amongst the cold space between the stars as exiles, looking for a place where we might find comfort, and most of all home."

5054, "We learned the lesson again with Capella, a place I once called home. When the Shivans came again, we fled our homes with a hope that we could soon return. We hoped that the GTVA would stop them. Yet after a short-lived victory, we saw our place in the universe. The Shivans tore through our defenses as if they were paper, batting us aside as if we were nothing but a minor annoyance. In efforts to save the rest of our colonies, the jump nodes were collapsed, and the Shivan advance stopped at Capella. 

Yet I am left to wonder. I look at the starfield from here at Altair, looking at the golden glow of the star I was born under. Yet I know this to be an illusion, this system will not see the supernova that destroyed our home for many years to come. It is a reminder of a place to which we can never return. We are exiles once again."

5055, "In all, there were some two hundred million of us cast out of Eden to walk amongst the stars. We look for a place to call home. Many resent us, because the strain on the GTVA economy has thrown us into a new depression. The Vasudans have been kind, showing us a hospitality that we never expected. The wounds of the Terran-Vasudan War still run deep, it has been heartening to discover, however, their honour and their trust. Yet perhaps they have more in common than we once thought, for they too are exiles, having a deeper understanding of what it is to never return home. 

This is why we come to Altair, the doorway to a new promised land. The systems beyond show great promise and hope of a new found freedom for our people. For the first time in many, many years, I feel hope for our future.

5056, "It has been one week since the jump corridor between $b Tau $b Sigma and the $b Altair system was quarantined under provisions from the $b Beta $b Aquilae $b Securities $b Act. Any discussion on this matter is $b classified. Travel in this subspace corridor is strictly prohibited, even to $g GTVA personnel. As such, all members of the $b 212th $b Silver $b Scythes present in $b Altair have been temporarily assigned to the Vasudan Installation, $f GVI $f Luxor."

5059, "The $f GVI $f Luxor is a decommissioned Vasudan $b Typhon class destroyer combined with a $b Ganymede docking ring. It serves its purposes well and is a very flexible design. 

While the $f Luxor's fighter complement can be that of a fully operational destroyer, they are operating at approximately half-strength. Since your stay in $b Altair is for an unspecified time, your skills will be put to use. While assigned to $f Luxor $f Station, you will be assigned to fly patrols and escort duty alongside your Vasudan colleagues."

5060, "In spite of the closure of the jump corridor, $g Capellan refugees have begun to arrive in the $b Altair system. In all, some one million refugees are expected to pass through here in the coming weeks. 

Leading the way is the $f GTM $f Alexis, a medical frigate carrying Governor R.F. M'Kembe. "

$f Alpha wing, you are charged with ensuring security in the area. You are responsible for not only the Governor's safety, but for the $f GTM $f Alexis and the rest of the refugee fleet."

5066, "Governor's Shuttle"

5067, "$f Delta wing is flying patrol around $f Luxor $f Station. They are under your command if you need assistance with the convoy. The $f GVCv $f Qualmotep is also on active duty near the station. 

In an emergency, $f Beta wing is also on standby as the refugee fleet approaches. They will only be launched at the discretion of $f Luxor station. "

5069, "Beta"

5070, "We do not know what potential security threats exist. However, there are several pirate groups in operation in these outer systems. They have been plaguing $g GTVA security forces significantly over the past few months. $b Morgan $b Technologies is one of many voices claiming that the $g GTVA does not have the ability to maintain security in this region. 

Keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. With the Governor's arrival, it is very possible that one of these pirate groups may attempt some kind of raid. Good luck pilot!"

5071, "If any security threat was perceived before, now it has become critical. Pirates operating with fighters, bombers and even a small cruiser is one thing, yet for this group to be this well armed indicates something much deeper and dangerous.

Additionally, the docking bays of the GVI Luxor were sabotaged by a substantial explosion. In doing so, the Governor's Shuttle was stranded outside the station during the firefight, leaving it vulnerable to a kidnap attempt.

It seems that Kappa wing had access to GTVA clearance codes in the system. This is a serious breach of security. Their IFF appeared as friendly so that they could approach the convoy unmolested. Fortunately, with you and Alpha 2 flying escort, you were able to pick up on the inflection of their voice and act on the situation before they could carry out their orders."

5072, "Governor M'kembe was kidnapped by an Elysium class cargo transport that appeared while all of our fighter wings were tied down in battle. We had warning, pilot - you could have prevented this."

5073, "As soon as you receive word that the Sneak has arrived, disengage from the main battle and rescue the governor. You will need your afterburners, missiles, and guns."

5074, "However, to the mission... you managed to thwart an attempt to kidnap Governor M'kembe. Your quick action and adequate response has prevented what could have been a serious incident. "

5075, "The death of Governor M'kembe is unacceptable.  His leadership will be sorely missed. We expected better from you pilot. Your poor conduct has not only seen the death of a well respected leader, but has endangered the secure future of millions of lives. "

5076, "The GVCv Qualmotep was destroyed in the firefight. Her loss is a substantial blow to security in the area. "

5077, "The bombers pose a serious initial threat to the Qualmotep, as does the Ithaca. Try to take out the bombers quickly, as well as the Ithaca beam cannons."

5078, "The Ithaca, a Deimos-class corvette represents a substantial security threat in the area. While it was driven off, we are going to have to take some steps to track it down.

We were fortunate that the GTFf Cypher was in the area, and helped drive off this pirate attack. However, details of their presence in the system is classified. You are not to discuss this matter, even amongst your wingmates."

5079, "Unfortunately, the food convoy fell under attack on the way to their station. The loss of this part of the convoy is serious enough that we will have to look at alternative means of feeding the Capellan Refugees."

5080, "The GTM Alexis was destroyed enroute to Luxor Station. We are more than disappointed, pilot. Over 3,000 lives were lost when she went up. This will be reflected on your permanent record. "

5081, "The GTM Alexis successfully made it to her rendezvous point. As flagship of the Capellan flotilla, she will hold position at Luxor Station to supervise the operation. Hopefully, the quarantine of the jump node will be short lived, and the Capellans will be able to establish a new home. "

5082, "Regardless, the situation has now become serious enough that the GTVA is mobilizing its fleets to deal with the security threats in this region. We are going to have our hands full over the next few weeks, pilot.

Luxor Station
Hunt for the Ithaca

Four days have passed since the attack by the mercenary group upon the Capellan refugees entering at the GVI Luxor. Thankfully all that was destroyed were a few containers of food. Morgan Technologies has generously offered aid to the refugees until the subspace corridor to Tau Sigma is reopened.

All has remained quiet in Altair since the attack, and despite numerous searches, we have been unable to locate the Ithaca, the mercenary corvette."

5182, "Attack on GTSC Berkeley

However, at 1046 Terran Standard Time we received a distress call from the GTSC Berkeley. This Terran science cruiser was studying magnetic field anomalies near the Casa belt, a scattered asteroid belt between Altair 3 and Altair 4.

The Berkeley reported that it was under attack from a Deimos-class corvette. Based on this data and the events of the past four days, we must assume this to be the Ithaca. The Ithaca destroyed the Berkeley at 1052 hours."

5183, "Security Risk

The threat the Ithaca poses is extreme. We cannot ignore it, nor can we wait for GTVA fleet assets to reinforce us. By that time the Ithaca may have moved on. We must deal with the Ithaca at once.

Unfortunately, the GVCv Qualmotep was severely damaged in its last engagement. Despite repairs, it is still not fit for battle. The Qualmotep will have to fight at long range, if at all. Still, at this point we have little choice."

5184, "Terran Fighter Repairs

Regrettably, we have been unable to repair the damage which your Myrmidon fighters sustained during the engagement in the Altair-Tau Sigma jump corridor. We lack the parts required for a full refit of a Terran fighter. The Myrmidons will never fly again.

You will have to make use of the Vasudan fighters which we have available. Fortunately, we have enough spare fighters for you to use and some fighters modified for Terran use. Get used to them, you may not be flying Terran issues for a while to come.

Report to mission briefing on the double, pilots."

5185, "As you are all well aware, the $h Ithaca must be dealt with immediately.  Latest data shows it to be seeking refuge in the $b Casa $b Belt. The belt's composition prevents sensors from penetrating it. We believe that the $h Ithaca is making repairs within the belt."

5186, "Because of its intelligence value alone, we must attempt to capture the $h Ithaca.This will also eliminate the threat posed by the vessel without having the $f Qualmotep engage it in direct combat."

5187, "$f Alpha wing, flying $b Horus fighters, will be integral to this mission's success. You must plant a $b TAG guidance beacon on the $h Ithaca's hull. Evade the fighters guarding the corvette until this task is complete. Our data suggests four to five fighters, all damaged, guarding the $h Ithaca."

5188, "Sentry"

5189, "The $f GVCv $f Qualmotep will then engage the $h Ithaca at long range using overcharged beam cannons. The weapons will only have enough energy for a few shots, so the $f Qualmotep may need your help to disable the $h Ithaca. For this reason the $b Akheton $b SDG disruptor cannon has been made available to you, if you wish to use it. However, you will be required to modify your loadout if you wish to use this weapon. You may vary your loadout if you wish, though the $b TAG missiles will be required for the mission. The $f GVA $f Neith will be providing a sensor scrambler field to prevent the detection of the $f Qualmotep by the $r mercenaries. $f Alpha wing will then deal with the defending fighters."

The mercenary vessel will be in no shape to put up a fight, so hopefully they'll surrender peacefully. If they do not, $f Alpha wing will disarm them as well. When we have the $h Ithaca's crew, you will be authorised to depart.

Good hunting, $f Alpha."

5192, "The apparent self-immolation of the crew of the Ithaca cannot be readily explained, especially considering their last words. It appears that they were as taken by surprise as we were. We suspect that the destruction of the Ithaca was linked to the unusual sensor readings recorded by Alpha 2 just prior to the explosion. The sensor data is under analysis now.

The crew of the GVT Isiroth were killed in action. However, their honourable death was not entirely in vain, for we have at least removed the threat the Ithaca posed."

5193, "Alpha wing, with the tools available to you the task you were given should not have been difficult. Your failure to provide fire support for the Qualmotep and disable the Ithaca has resulted in it's disappearance, for the second time. We have been unable to track the vessel, though we have received reports that another Capellan food convoy was hit by the Ithaca at 0315 hours."

5194, "The mercenary wings which threatened us were all destroyed by you and your wings. For this you are to be commended. In the fight against pirates and mercenaries, we need to retain the upper hand."

5195, "Your failure to destroy the mercenary attack wings pales in comparison to the loss of life we have seen today. In the constant battle against criminal elements we must always attempt to turn the odds in our favour."

5196, "The identity and allegiance of the unidentified Faustus-class science vessel sighted near the Ithaca immediately prior to the explosion remains unknown. Our pilots were unable to gain sensor lock. We're looking into this vessel's origin and motives but we have little to go on.

According to her profile, she was transporting supplies for the $g Capellan refugee fleet when she signalled an onboard explosion. As of yet the cause is unknown. "

5259, "Bates"

5260, "The $f GTCv $f Escher is responding the distress call. $f Alpha wing, you will be providing fighter cover launched from $f Luxor $f Station. The $f Escher recently arrived in the area and is conducting some preliminary scans for any additional $r pirate activity. While the $r pirate corvette $h Ithaca was neutralized in our last operation, security is of paramount concern."

5261, "Escher"

5262, "The $f Bates is presently stranded in the heart of a small asteroid belt. It reports that its cargo container was destroyed, scattering its contents of smaller containers everywhere. The $f Escher has already arrived on the scene and is moving to assist. However, the $f Escher just signalled us. They have noticed an odd power fluctuation near the freighter and are proceeding with caution. "

Prepare for launch. "

5265, "It seems that the Bates distress signal was a trap. Pirates must have ransacked her earlier and planted the distress signal, along with energy draining and anti-fighter mines. The real target was the GTCv Escher, as she is attached to SOC intelligence gathering operations."

5266, "The Escher was destroyed in the firefight by incoming bombers. Her loss is a considerable blow to a GTVA attempting to establish a secure presence in the Altair and Tau Sigma star systems."

5267, "The primary threat to the Escher is the bombers. However, there are too many of them to deal with at once. Your most effective solution is to find and destroy the energy draining mines as quickly as possible. Once free from the draining field, the Escher will be able to power up her defensive weaponry. "

5268, "Congratulations, pilot, you managed to destroy the minefield, and fend off the pirates long enough for the Escher to make her escape. There were some very important people aboard, and they took notice of your actions."

SOC Reassignment

Welcome to Special Operations Command, pilots. This is Jonas Ekestam, captain of the GTCv Escher. Not many are recruited into our ranks, but when they are, they are pilots of the highest calibre. After your performance defending the Escher from pirates, as well as excellent performance in several other missions, we have decided that those pilots who flew Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 in previous missions will fill the gaps in our deep cover team."

5326, "Deep Cover Brief

Deep cover missions are carried out behind enemy lines with little or no logistical support. You've got to be tough to make it through a mission like this, but we're sure you'll be able to manage."

5327, "Tau Sigma Mercenaries

The subject of this operation is the mercenary group operating out of Tau Sigma - also active in Altair - that we believe are responsible for numerous attacks on GTVA targets. We must discover to whom these mercenaries report, and who has been leaking them and other groups sensitive information about GTVA ship movements."

5328, "Undercover Contact

Your contact on this mission will be Lieutenant Tom Faulkner. Faulkner infiltrated the mercenary group five weeks ago and has been investigating ever since. He'll teach you all you need to know about deep cover ops."

5329, "Rendezvous with Mercenaries

The SOC have certain privileges and the Escher is able to travel through the subspace corridor to Tau Sigma despite the blockade. We'll be dropping you off at a rendezvous point in Altair before travelling on to Tau Sigma Station, where we have some supplies to deliver."

5330, "Denial of Knowledge

Good luck, pilots. This will be a difficult assignment, but I'm sure we have the right pilots for the job. Remember that if you are uncovered, the SOC will disavow all knowledge of your assignment. Agents are provided with cyanide capsules for a reason. I'm sure I needn't spell it out."

5331, "Good morning, pilots. I'm Lieutenant Tom Faulkner, your contact inside the $b mercenary $b group for the duration of this operation. Our principal objective here is to discover to whom these mercs report, and who has been supplying them with sensitive information about $g GTVA movements. We have you a fairly routine job today. We are to guard a cargo depot belonging to our mysterious employer."

5332, "Depot"

5336, "I'll be flying $f Shadow $f 2. Your ship has been fitted with a secure channel communications device, which will allow you to speak to other members of $f Shadow wing without the other $b mercenaries listening in. They should interpret your communications as systems diagnostic and targeting data.  The device was tested extensively during the $g GTVA's conflict with the $r Neo-Terran $r Front and should work perfectly."

5337, "Shadow 2"

5338, "If you get the opportunity, try to scan the cargo containers. Their contents might give us a lead on the employer of the mercenaries. You'll never know if you don't take a look, as they say.

Watch yourselves out there, pilots, and good luck."

5339, "Cargo"

5340, "Shadow, you did an excellent job of protecting the cargo from the pirates. It seems that these pirates are somewhat more organised and devious than most of the other groups operating in the system. They could pose a more serious threat to us than we had initially thought."

5341, "All of the pirate raiders were destroyed before they could make off with any of the cargo. What would have happened to us if they had got hold of the cargo doesn't bear thinking about."

5342, "The RGFr Sophron was saved with our help. This freighter belongs to Redman-Gray, a major Capellan mining corporation now trying to set itself up here in Tau Sigma. However, larger companies such as Morgan have quite a stranglehold on the local mining market. You'll be pleased to hear that we did get a small bonus for our effort."

5343, "The cargo containers seem to hold equipment for freighters and mining operations. Unfortunately, this doesn't really tell us a great deal. There are many mining companies in this system alone, and that cargo could belong to any one of them. The jamming equipment, however, is intriguing."

5344, "What we did out there today has shown the mercenaries that we can be trusted. Bearing our precarious position in mind, we could do with as much of their trust as we can get."

5345, "Despite the number of mercenary fighters defending the small depot, we failed to protect it from a small group of disorganised pirates."

5346, "Destroy or disable the freighters as soon as possible."

5347, "Some of the raiders got away. No doubt that the next time they attack they'll be better prepared and armed. This pirate group seems better organised than the rest. We'll have to keep a close eye on them."

5348, "Destroy all of the raiders before departing."

5349, "The RGFr Sophron was destroyed by the pirate raiders. While the destruction of this mining freighter means little to us, any loss of civilian life should be prevented. The mercs won't be too happy that their chance of getting a reward has slipped away."

5350, "Leave Shadow and Kidd wings alone to guard the Sophron."

5351, "You had ample time to scan the cargo at the depot, Shadow 1. Those containers could have held the key to this whole mystery."

5352, "Scan the cargo at the start of the mission."

5353, "Our failure out there has put a black mark on Shadow wing's record with the mercenaries. They won't be too pleased about this mess. We could have done to succeed in the mission in order to gain the mercenaries' trust. We can only hope that our next mission gives us a chance to redeem ourselves."

5354, "Your desertion put the entire wing under suspicion, pilot. Sneaking off in the middle of a mission did not give a good impression, and our already precarious position with them has been weakened further.

I'm dropping you from the team, pilot. You aren't suited to deep cover operations, evidently. With luck, they won't even know you're gone.

These fighters should pose no threat to us, as we will be equipped with far more modern fighters. However, the flak guns on the freighters pose a considerable threat. Avoid them if possible by attacking the freighters from below."

The convoy we are attacking is not a genuine $g GTVA convoy - it's a mock-up created by $g GTVI in order to give us the opportunity to gain the trust of the $b mercenaries. However, the cargo is real, as is the threat of $r raiders. The convoy is also armed. This is in order to create the illusion that it is real. However, the armaments on the fighters are considerably below the norm. It will also still jump to $f Luxor $f Station if we fail to intercept it.

Needless to say, you do NOT tell anyone this. Do so and our cover's blown for sure. I'm not sure how the mercs would react, but suffice it to say that swallowing that cyanide capsule would probably be a more comfortable death. Now get down to the fighter bays, they're waiting for us."

Thankfully no GTVA personnel lost their lives on the vessels and the mercenaries did not catch onto our ruse.  "

The mercenaries are dissapointed with us, and so am I. I thought that pilots recruited to the SOC were of the highest quality. Looks like I was wrong."

5444, "Destroy the fighters, as they have Hornet missiles.  Assign another wing to simultaneously fight off the bombers."

Several friends, as well as our valuable payment, are gone. It seems that the pirates thought that if they couldn't have the cash, neither could we."

5541, "The Zenith is a weakly armed and armoured vessel.  It can't stand up to much punishment or dish much out.  Make sure it is well protected."

5542, "The crew of the Whisperer send their sincere thanks to all of your for your defence of their ship from the pirates' attack. She never would've made it through the engagement without your intervention, which was totally unneccessary. Thankfully your extra duties did not endanger the Zenith as it made its way out, and Tachyon was capable of defending the transport."

5543, "The destruction of the Whisperer was highly unfortunate. The pirates' attack was fast and powerful, and the Whisperer stood little chance of survival.  "

5544, "Dispatch the pirate gunboats and bombers quickly to ensure the survival of the Whisperer."

5545, "The pirate raiders that showed up to threaten our vital operation were all dispatched with skill and efficiency. Your skill matches your reputation, Shadow. Although there were many pirate vessels, none escaped to tell of today's engagement."

5546, "Not all of the pirates that attacked our operation were destroyed by our forces. This was not helped by the sudden and mysterious disappearance of Halberd wing but is still a blow. We can only hope that the pirates who escaped did not manage to ascertain the location of our base from our exit vectors."

5547, "Draw the pirate vessels to the Whisperer's beam cannons, or use your wingmen to engage them."

5548, "You managed to cover the Zenith's escape, protect the Whisperer from harm and destroy all of the attacking pirates. Excellent work, Shadow! Truly a sign of a great pilot."

"

5632, "Okay, $f Shadow, we've been assigned an important but potentially dangerous mission by the $b mercenaries' employers themselves. It seems that our successes in the past few sorties we've flown have gained us something of a reputation. Hopefully it's a good one."

5633, "We will travel to the $b Altair-Tau $b Sigma jump node. The jump corridor is currently closed to all traffic. However, we hope to sneak in while the $r Vasudans aren't looking. Their vessels patrol in shifts, and there are some times when there are few or no vessels at the node for several minutes, due to a lack of resources here in $b Altair."

5634, "Vasudans"

5635, "We'll approach and enter the $b Tau $b Sigma node in between a vessel shift transfer. There should be no $r Vasudan presence. However, we don't want to linger in the area."

5636, "Once inside the jump corridor, we'll approach the site of the $r Shivan derelict, the $h Nyarlathotep. The mercs want a number of scans of this vessel for themsleves and their employer. The destroyer is not active, but the $r GTVA has secured the area."

5637, "Nyarlathotep"

5638, "A number of $r sentry wings patrol the area around the destroyer, and there are numerous science and surveillance vessels also in close proximity. Getting into the area may be difficult. The vessels at the site are unaware that we are $r GTVA operatives, and will use force. Once in, we need scans of the $b weapons and $b sensor subsystems of the destroyer."

5639, "Sentries"

5640, "Once we have the data, we get out as quickly as possible. Do not engage any $r GTVA forces unless directly threatened, and then do not destroy unless totally necessary. We don't need to make this any harder on ourselves.

Get down to the loading deck, pilots."

5641, "A series of unfortunate events prevented us from achieving our primary objective of scanning the Nyarlathotep. The GVCv Qualmotep and her fighter escort were unaware that we were GTVA operatives and acted on the only orders they knew of. Fortunately the Escher was able to intervene and rescue us."

5642, "However, even if we had entered the subspace corridor, it is unlikely that we would have obtained scans of the Shivan destroyer. Hostile fighters from an unknown group attacked the science vessels at the site of the derelict. All we know about them is that they are extemely well-equipped, possessing fighters that are special issue only in the GTVA today."

5643, "It is extremely fortunate that we were able to save the GTSC Tesla and GTA Los Alamos. Most of the research data from the Nyarlathotep was saved and we have invaluable eyewitness accounts of the attack. When the Escher neared the Nyarlathotep, they did not discover any hostile craft or tampering with the Shivan vessel of any kind, but all other friendly craft had been annhilated."

5644, "The GTCv Escher confirmaed that all of the other vessels at the site of the Nyarlathotep had been destroyed, presumably by the same unknown vessels that destroyed the science vessels that fled from the scene. However, no hostiles were located.  It is unfortunate that the Los Alamos and Tesla were not saved. Their crews could have provided valuable insight into the attack, and the research they carried would have been a valuable asset."

5645, "Intercept bombs headed for the weak science vessels.  They are already damaged and won't stand much punishment."

5646, "Good work escorting the Escher. The attacks from enemy bombers were fierce, but you were able to stand up to them and protect our valuable corvette as it carried out its objectives."

5647, "The GTCv Escher was destroyed while attempting to carry out mission goals. Her skilled crew will be sadly missed, and the firepower the Escher wielded would have been useful, especially with the rising of this new enemy.

More distressingly, the Escher was to be key in bringing the Nyarlathotep out of the node and into GTVA hands. Furthermore, the corvette was also to have had a role in defusing a situation at Tau Sigma Station, the soon-to-be home of the Shivan derelict. With the loss of the Escher, a new corvette not burdened by other duties will have to be found - a process that could take weeks, if not months."

5648, "Intercept Lancet wing's bombs before they do serious damage to the Escher's hull."

5649, "It's been a pleasure serving with a group of pilots as talented as yourselves, and GTVI has gained some valuable information through our actions. However, our undercover job is over now. I've been reassigned to discovering the identities of these mysterious attackers, and you're headed back to Tau Sigma Station. I hear that the situation in Tau Sigma isn't good, and they'll probably need you there to help out. Good luck with your next assignment, Alpha. I'm sure you'll do well. Remember, GTVI is watching you. This may not be the last time your services are required.

-- Revelation 13:18

It is amazing how many times throughout history people have used this passage to point out evil somewhere else. The great doomsayers of the late 20th Century turned this into an ill-conceived art. John of Patmos was not writing in some kind of mystical code pointing to some obscure figure in the future, but to the reality of evil in our midst. Through metaphor and imagery, John pulled back the curtain of reality to look at ourselves more deeply. Yet we have always wanted to put the blame elsewhere. The Shivans or the Vasudans have been an unfortunate convenience for our darker nature. In looking somewhere else, we don't realize what we ourselves are capable of... 

-- Bishop Rambaugh, New Galactic Biblical Commentary - Revelation. 2337"

5733, "Captain Ekestam of the GTCv Escher here. Welcome back to the $b Tau $b Sigma mining colonies, pilot. The $g GTVA has decided to reopen the jump corridor. Unfortunately, your return will not be as warmly received as it was the first time. In the three weeks since the $b Tau $b Sigma-Altair jump corridor was quarantined, supplies have not been getting through to the station. While there is another jump corridor into the region, it is far less stable and requires travel through the uncontrolled systems beyond $b Regulus.

As a result, the residents have been cut off without much more than emergency supplies, and $b Tau $b Sigma is now in a state of unrest."

5734, "Several hours ago, at 0745, workers on board the station commandeered the $b TRGC $b Sai and the $f GTC $f LoneWolf. They, along with a group of freighters, gas miners, and other cargo ships have formed a blockade in protest of the $g GTVA's closure of the jump corridor. At this time, we do not know their demands. Since their original move, all communication with $b Tau $b Sigma has been cut off. "

5735, "Blockading Miners"

We have little choice but to move the $r Shivan derelict out of the node and into the $b Tau $b Sigma system within the next several hours. If we do not, the corridor will become too unstable to support the flood of $g Capellan refugees now gathering in $b Altair."

5738, "$f Alpha wing, you will be flying escort to the $f GTCv $f Escher as we arrive in system to help calm the protest. We know there are mercenaries and pirates in system that may be a part of the blockade. The $f Escher may need fighter cover if things turn ugly.

Report for launch."

5739, "Welcome back to Tau Sigma Station, pilot.

The most difficult thing in any riot, is being able to focus on doing one thing well in the middle of chaos. With all that has happened, we are still picking up the pieces. However, as near as we can discern, this is what happened."

5740, "The arrival of the SD Nyarlathotep sent a wave of panic throughout the protest crowd. This wasn't unexpected, but we had hoped to clear the area before the superdestroyer was brought out of subspace.

It seems the crew of the Clement were experienced enough with the main guns of the Fenris cruiser, that they panicked and began firing on the Nyarlathotep. Failing reason, the Escher ordered you to destroy the forward beam cannon of the Clement, which you did quickly and efficiently."

5741, "It seems that while this was a protest on the part of union workers in the region, some of the cruisers, including the Cassius, the Nero, and the Gas Miner Brutus were hired union busters. It seems that they were intending to instigate a riot all along, hopefully killing Adam Tarovich in the melee."

5742, "Excellent job in protecting the Sai in the middle of that firefight. You managed to focus well in the midst of a very chaotic situation. Even though in custody, Mr. Tarovich is grateful for your efforts in warding off attacks during the riot."

5743, "Unfortunately, the Sai was destroyed in the riot, and Adam Tarovich along with her. This situation is getting out of hand. It is not a loss that we can accept."

5744, "The Sai is the primary target of the bombers. Be sure to concentrate on intercepting their attack run."

5745, "The Nero and all of her crew were unexpectedly destroyed by a stray beam from the SD Nyarlathotep. We are unclear if the Nero was deliberately firing on the the SuperDestroyer, or if they were simply missing the Sai. Regardless, the Nyarlathotep's defensive systems roared to life, destroying the Nero almost instantly.

We are taking extra precautions as the Nyarlathotep is being placed into docking rings near Tau Sigma Station. We do not want to risk reactivating her automated defenses. The science team on board is working overtime to determine what happened."

5746, "This was a difficult environment to fly in, Pilot. Riots are perhaps the worst kinds of engagements to be in. Innocent people always get hurt, and no one wins. It is now of paramount importance that we secure the rest of this system. 

Our first task will be to recapture the GTC LoneWolf which escaped in the melee.

5836, "The Derelict's Impact

Since the mysterious closure of the Altair jump node in Tau Sigma over three weeks ago, civilians in the beleaguered system had not been receiving pay or supplies. The situation had grown desperate, with civilians living on emergency rations alone until yesterday, when disgruntled inhabitants of Tau Sigma station took to their vessels or simply seized whatever they could lay hands on and formed a blockade at the jump node to voice their protest."

5837, "The Tau Sigma Riot

The protesters met a GTVI group entering through the Altair jump node, demanding pay and better conditions. The GTVI vessels, however, were not prepared to negotiate and demanded that the protesters move their ships from the vicinity of the subspace node. However, the protesters refused point-blank and were met with a terrifying sight as a result - a Lucifer class destroyer, only the second vessel of its type ever encountered."

5838, "Chaos and Anarchy

The appearance of this destroyer sent a wave of panic through the crowds, sparking off a riot. As GTVA forces battled to protect civilians, hired union-busters made an attempt on the life of the protest leader, Adam Tarovich. The appearance of pirates did nothing to improve matters and the peaceful blockade ended in bloodshed and a spiralling death toll, now estimated at several hundred."

5839, "GTVA Response

GTVA Local Command refuses to comment on this incident or the purpose of bringing the SD Nyarlathotep out of the subspace corridor other than to say that the destroyer posed a 'considerable risk to the long-term stability of the subspace tunnel'. The Shivan derelict has now been towed into the vicinity of Tau Sigma station, presumably for research purposes."

5840, "Allied Assistance

Reinforcements from other nearby GTVA systems are on the way to secure the Nyarlathotep and to deal with the growing pirate threat in the region. The Altair node has been re-opened and trade routes re-established. For the moment, it seems some measure of normality has returned to the distant colony system.

5841, "Alright, pilots, you've heard the news-scans and you know what went on out there yesterday. We must recover the $h GTC $h Lonewolf from the civilians who currently have control of the ship. We have traced the civilians to a small scrapyard on the outskirts of $b Tau $b Sigma. They appear to be hiding in this debris field. What they aim to achieve by retaining the cruiser is unknown."

5843, "The civilians in control of the $h Lonewolf aren't well-trained. They are, however totally unpredictable. We don't know how they will react to our appearance. The last thing that we want is the civilians to react badly and attack our forces - exercise caution, pilots."

5844, "$f Alpha wing will lead this operation. You'll arrive on the far side of the scrapyard and proceed towards the $f Lonewolf. If the crew won't surrender, disable her - this, however, is a last-ditch option. If it seems that the civilians will not surrender, you will however be authorised to carry out the attack."

5845, "Scrapyard"

5846, "When you have disabled the $h Lonewolf, we'll send in a recovery team to secure the vessel and apprehend the civilians on board. Cover the team as they dock. We don't want the crew to pull anything on us."

5847, "Capture crew"

5848, "With our recent efforts to quell $r pirate activity in $b Tau $b Sigma, there should be no expected attack from any pirates. If there are, keep the $h Lonewolf and the transport safe. The crew of the $h Lonewolf may be rioters, but they're civilians all the same. Take care when dealing with them. We've lost enough dignity with the fiasco that was the riot, and we don't need any more, that's for sure. Capturing the $h LoneWolf would certainly be some kind of victory for us."

5849, "Thanks to your efforts, a devious pirate attack was thwarted and the GTC Lonewolf has been returned to us only slightly the worse for wear. The repairs will not take too long to carry out, and the Lonewolf should be back on active service for your next sortie.

The civilians who seized the Lonewolf have been placed under arrest. Their court hearing awaits, but it is unlikely they will be punished too severely."

5850, "The pirates captured the GTC Lonewolf in a devious attack. What they have taken weakens our hand and strengthens their own.

We do not know what the pirates intend to do with the civilians who were on board the Lonewolf. They will likely be used as bargaining chips in the future.  Whatever happens, this has become a source of extreme embarrassment for us."

5851, "Destroy the Arcturus as soon as possible.  If you can't do that, disable the Lonewolf again."

5852, "The GTC Lonewolf was destroyed by pirate forces masquerading as derelicts and GTVA ships. This devious attack has not only cost us a fine warship with a proud history, but the lives of many civilians. Confidence in the GTVA's ability to control pirate attacks has fallen dramatically."

5853, "Shoot down Grey wing - their bombs pose the greatest threat to the Lonewolf."

5854, "The pirates who took part in the attack will trouble us no more, for Alpha wing destroyed them all. While unfortunate, this was necessary. We must curb pirate activity in the system before it grows out of hand."

5855, "Although they were unexpected, you handled the sentry guns well. It appears that someone had tampered with them before we arrived. Clearly someone has put a lot of thought into this operation."

"

5942, "Alright, pilots, intel has just discovered a $r pirate ammunition supply depot near a small moon of $b Tau $b Sigma $b 7. Their supplies are considerable, with some forty-two fighters, six bombers, and the supplies to keep them a pain in our side for some time to come. "

5943, "Vigilant"

5944, "Supplies"

5945, "$g Intel has been using long-range scans to determine the composition and guarding patterns of the depot. We have reason to believe that the pirates and whatever political forces that guide them are set to move to a more secure location within the next twenty-four hours. "

5946, "With the arrival of the $h Nyarlathotep at $f Tau $f Sigma $f Station, it is imperative that we secure the region. This ammunition supply depot has been designated a primary target. Unfortunately, we cannot wait for the additional $g GTVA forces that are enroute to the system. 

With this in mind, we are assembling a strike mission. Time is of the essence. We have a small window of opportunity, as the primary forces guarding the depot are now at their weakest. Even then, it will not be easy. "

5947, "The depot is still guarded by a wing of Hercules class fighters, designated $h White wing. Additionally, the supplies is guarded by no less than twenty sentry guns. The fighters are a credible threat, but the sentry guns are lethal. We will not have enough time to individually destroy each sentry gun to clear a path for our bombers. "

5948, "White"

5949, "The sentry guns are controlled and monitored by a crew aboard the $h Vigilant, a medical cruiser carrying more than three thousand civilians. Regardless of their political or criminal leanings, destroying the $h Vigilant is not an acceptable option. However, by destroying the $b radar $b dish on the $h Vigilant, we will temporarily knock out control of the sentry guns."

5950, "$f Alpha wing, your task is threefold - first, eliminate the fighter cover. Second, destroy the radar dish aboard the $h Vigilant, and third, destroy as much of the ammunition supply depot as possible."

5951, "Destroying the radar dish will only give you a brief window of time when the sentry guns will not work. They will switch to automatic sixty to eighty seconds after they stop receiving communications from the $h Vigilant. 

You will need to place your shots carefully. A well placed $b Cyclops bomb will be the most effective means to destroy the depot."

5952, "Remember, time is of the essence. We estimate that reinforcements are due to arrive in under ten minutes after you jump in. Hit them as hard as you can, and then get out. The $h Vigilant MUST survive the attack. Remember, we are soldiers, not butchers. We must do our best to protect civilian life, even if they fight against us. 

Report to the flight deck, pilots. "

5953, "The most important thing in any strike mission is surviving. The odds are often overwhelming, and the necessity for speed overshadows the need for accuracy. It is a tribute to one's skill when one is both fast and accurate. Good work in at least making it back."

5954, "While speed is essential, the need for accuracy in this mission was also necessary. The destruction of of the Vigilant is unacceptable in this kind of work. You can be sure of severe disciplinary action. If you end up without prison time, I will be very surprised. Get out of my sight."

5955, "Good job in making sure the Vigilant stayed alive. It was all the more difficult, given that she was firing on you while you were making your bombing runs. "

5956, "In taking out the Vigilant's radar dish, you had a little under eighty seconds to do as much damage as you could. "

5957, "White wing put up enough of a fight, but you were able to dispatch them effectively enough. Bombers are not the easiest craft to dogfight with, but then again, our options were limited."

5958, "Congratulations on destroying all the cargo containers. They held parts and supplies for the fighters in the depot."

5959, "The cargo containers contained weapon supplies for the fighters. Unfortunately you weren't able to get all of them in this strike. Better luck next time, pilot."

5960, "Excellent job in destroying all the fighters in the depot. In one swift move, you have saved many lives and have stalled the operations of pirates in the area."

It would seem that rivalries between various pirate factions are becoming more heated and bloody. However, most pirates would have taken the defenceless vessels at the outpost, not destroyed them.

Any $r pirates which do enter the area are to be eliminated. The valuable cargoes which the convoy craft carry and the civilians and scientists on board the vessels must be protected at all cost."

6115, "Finally, you won't be flying with all your usual wingmates this time around.  With the discovery of the $f Nyarlathotep we've received an influx of supplies and new pilots. They're rookies, just out of $g GTVA $g Academy. Still, I know you're an excellent pilot, $f Alpha $f 1. I'm sure you'll teach them all they need to know.

You know what you have to do. Get out there, $f Alpha."

6116, "The pirates dealt us a hefty blow out there today. You can console yourself with the fact that due to the sheer number of enemy bombers there was nothing you could have done to save those vessels from them.  "

6117, "At least some of the crew and research prototypes on board the Einstein were saved thanks to the efforts of your wing. Doctor Hadamard, leader of the Einstein's research crew thanks you for saving his and his colleagues' lives."

6118, "The loss is made all the more bitter by the destruction of the escape pods fleeing the Einstein, which carried important scientists and data."

6119, "The intent of the pirates remains a mystery. The TRGS Meridian and TRGF Haulian were left virtually untouched by the pirates. We still don't know what this means. However, as a result of this attack Command has decided to stamp down GTVA authority on these pirates in a series of missions to commence immediately. If the situation gets much worse than this we may have to impose martial law in Tau Sigma."

6120, "The motives of the pirates remains a mystery to us.  The TRG research vessels were left mostly unharmed by the pirates, though what this means is anyone's guess. However, as a result of the attack today Command has decided it's time to stamp out the pirate activity in the system. If it gets much worse around here we may be forced to impose a state of martial law. You failure to destroy the pirates which attacked our convoy today certainly doesn't help our cause."

6121, "Without the science vessels, their crews and their research, it seems that we will fall seriously behind in our research into the Nyarlathotep. Hopefully Morgan Technologies is still interested in offering assistance to us. They seem to be the only hope of getting the project back on track."

The senders identified themselves as the crew of the $b Event $b Horizon, a $b mercenary base in $b Tau $b Sigma. They reported that they were sustaining damage and required immediate assistance."

6181, "We have no record of an installation existing at the coordinates specified, but we're not likely to, given the less than savoury reputation these $b mercenaries have. Nevertheless, we must treat this as any distress call and respond. $f Alpha and $f Beta wings will investigate the area."

6182, "From what we have been told, the $b Event $b Horizon is under attack from a well-armed force. This is supported by partial sensor data we have obtained. If the installation is indeed under attack, assist in repelling them and defend the base."

The $f Cypher is also en route and will assist you with defence once it arrives."

6186, "Swiftsure"

6187, "Finally, beware of the enemy craft attacking the installation. The distress message stresses that the attackers are NOT normal $r pirates. Don't underestimate them, $f Alpha. Our sensor scans were interrupted at the same time as the distress call was cut, so we believe these hostile forces are blocking transmissions.

You have five minutes to customise your loadout. We can't spare any more."

6188, "Excellent work, pilots. The crew of the Event Horizon have given us valuable and deeply troubling information that would never have made it into our hands without your skilful piloting.  

It is clear that the events which occurred during this mission will change the future of the Tau Sigma system irrevocably. With the revelation by the Mercenary forces that Morgan Technologies has been employing them to disrupt and weaken GTVA control in this region in order to increase their own influence, there is only one possible course of action.

We have already sent encoded messages to GTVI and the GTVA Security Council in Delta Serpentis. While the Security Council cannot be expected to respond immediately, the GTVI has already authorised the freezing of all MT assets and impoundment of Morgan vessels operating on the Nyarlathotep. All Morgan employees will be removed from the Nyarlathotep and the Morgan officials will be taken into custody.

Unfortunately Morgan's influence extends beyond merely political subversion. It appears that Morgan Technologies have gathered and supplied a large military force of the most high-tech vessels and weapons in modern-day GTVA fleets. At the head of the MT armed force is the MTD Auriga, a heavily modified Orion-class destroyer. You saw what it did out there, pilots. The Auriga poses a grave threat to the security of the region. It's full capabilities remain unknown, but it is clearly very powerful. Scouting sorties to ascertain the vessel's capability will be launched as soon as it is located.

Go catch a few hours of sleep, pilots. We'll need you all later. We will begin the impoundment of Morgan assets at 0900 hours."

6189, "The crew of the Event Horizon perished in the attack on their base and the GTT Swiftsure. The information that they held was of immeasurable value to the GTVA. Under normal circumstances you'd be punished quite severely for this failure, but considering the value these mercenaries would have had to us...

From the transmissions sent by the crew of the Event Horizon it appears that Morgan Technolgies has been responsible for the string of attacks on GTVA and civilian targets. The mercenaries were employed by Morgan, but refused to do all of their dirty work for them. It seems that some of the attacks have been on questionable moral ground.

We have already sent encoded messages to GTVI and the GTVA Security Council in Delta Serpentis. While the Security Council cannot be expected to respond immediately, the GTVI has already authorised the freezing of all MT assets and impoundment of Morgan vessels operating on the Nyarlathotep pending a full investigation of the incident. All Morgan employees will be removed from the Nyarlathotep and the Morgan officials will be taken into custody to be questioned about the matter.

Unfortunately Morgan's influence seems to extend beyond merely political subversion. It appears that Morgan Technologies have gathered and supplied a large military force of the most high-tech vessels and weapons in modern-day GTVA fleets.

Your failure today indicates that perhaps the pressure might just be too much for you. While you are not being discharged from service, neither can we risk having you on the front lines, when there is the all-too-real possibility of you screwing up just when it counts the most - as you did today.

It's funny, I've been working on projects like this for almost all of my life. I have been searching for the secrets of the universe for as long as I can remember, and now all I want to do is go home. The Nyarlathotep is an archaeologist's dream. A derelict Shivan superdestroyer found adrift in subspace. Not since the discovery of the ruins of the Ancients have we come across something so horribly beautiful. It is a work of art, its lines and curves aesthetically pleasing in their own dark way. Some of these structures look like they have been grown, not built.

The recent business with Morgan Technologies has me concerned. Our research is supposed to be for the benefit of the Terran and Vasudan races. Now I find out that MT has been using their influence to gain political control of the region. They even killed some of my colleagues to get their people on board the Nyarlathotep. Maybe that's why I want to go home - even with the MT employees now in custody, I don't trust the people I am working with, and I never feel like I am alone.

Tau Sigma Station
The Hunt for the Nyarlathotep

It has been six days since the SD Nyarlathotep sprang to life and carved its way out of its holding docks at Tau Sigma Station. Even with full patrols scouring Tau Sigma, there is no sign of the superdestroyer or the SCv Tsathoggua, the corvette that assisted its escape. Even with the many navigation and scanning beacons added to the system in recent weeks, finding an object 3,000 metres long in a star system many millions of kilometres across is nearly an impossible task."

6370, "Superdestroyer Assessment

It is difficult to stress the severity of the situation. The Nyarlathotep is a Shivan Lucifer-class destroyer, the same type of vessel that rendered the surface of Vasuda Prime uninhabitable almost forty years ago. While considerably smaller than the Sathanas-class juggernauts, the Nyarlathotep wields only slightly less firepower. In battle simulations from the information we gathered, we now know that the much larger GTVA Colossus would only have had a 22% chance of surviving an encounter with a this vessel. While the point is now moot, the reason for our full alert status is anything but."

The GTD Valhalla is moving to Tau Sigma to take command and coordinate the search for the Nyarlathotep and Tsathoggua.

There is also the other variable: The Morgan Technologies destroyer Auriga is also a credible threat in the system, and at present we do not know if she will be willing to cooperate in our efforts against this new Shivan problem.

It seems that this success has improved public support for the GTVA around here a little."

The Shivans also seem to possess far greater situational awareness than anticipated. The GTVA Task Force has now arrived in system and has begun to secure the area around the Phi Eridani jump node. Clearly accurate reconnaissance on the Shivan presence will be required before any action is taken if we don't want to be ambushed again. We will exercise caution in our future attacks."

While we would not have been able to garner much information about Phi Eridani however this engagement had turned out, the loss of a corvette is a blow that we shouldn't have had to take. Furthermore, the Shivans that destroyed the Andrasta continue to guard the Tau Sigma jump node, making any incursion into Phi Eridani far, far more difficult than expected.

While the Valhalla and its escort are ready and willing to enter Shivan space, this failure is not an auspicious start to the operation. Luckily for you, you will not be present - Command has decided that you'd be better off elsewhere, back flying deep space patrols for Tau Sigma Station.

The Superdestroyer Discovered

Okay pilots, we've found the Nyarlathotep. She is hiding in a stellar gas cloud within the Phi Eridani system. Given the presence of both the Tsathoggua and the Tulzscha in system, this setup indicates something much more widespread and dangerous than even the Nyarlathotep by herself. These ships had to come from somewhere, and GTVI is still puzzled as to their source. The only current speculation that we have is that the Nyarlathotep was part of a larger fleet that has been lying dormant in subspace for thousands of years. Dr. Hadamard's speculation that the Nyarlathotep was indeed the Lucifer that destroyed the civilization of the Ancients seems both the most plausible and the most troubling."

The Nyarlathotep herself was residing dormant in subspace until a few weeks ago, when she emerged through a rift created by the explosion of the MT Mudenerei AWACs. While it was not clear at the time who was controlling the ships in that subspace battle, subsequent evidence has revealed that Morgan Technologies is behind much of the recent criminal activities in these systems. However, the Nyarlathotep's presence seems to be just the beginning of something darker."

We barely escaped with our lives from the last Shivan invasion, and if the Nyarlathotep is not alone, the danger is greater than we first imagined."

6611, "GTVA Response

We need information, and we need it now. We have pinpointed the location of the Nyarlathotep, but we do not know her present activities. Before we launch any kind of a strike, we are going to need some accurate information on her location and her status. We are fortunate to have a handful of Mara class fighters in our possession that have been converted so that Terran pilots can fly them. 

I hope you've been brushing up on your Shivan etiquette, pilot. You're going behind the lines."

6612, "At 1715 hours, we pinpointed the source of $r Shivan transmissions in the $b Phi $b Eridani system. The $h Nyarlathotep is located in a small stellar cloud that until now, has been masking all of our scans of the system. Our recent engagements with the $h Tsathoggua and the $h Tulzscha helped us to localize the $h Nyarlathotep's haven. At present, the $f GTD $f Valhalla is on standby, and will be awaiting  with a small strike force of $g GTVA ships that will be ready to deploy in three hours. The information that you provide will be used to launch the strike against the superdestroyer."

6613, "Your task is simple. In captured $b Mara fighters, get close enough to the $h Nyarlathotep and scan her $b Navigation, $b Communications, $b Sensors, $b Weapons and $b Fighterbay subsystems. Your fighters will appear to be $r Shivan, right down to your EM signatures - provided that you do not get too close to patrolling $r Shivans. The interference created by the stellar gas cloud should provide you with enough cover. However, steer clear of the other $r Shivan fighter patrols in the area. If they get too close, you will be readily identified. "

6614, "Given the $h Tulzscha's escape when the $h Tsathoggua was destroyed, we expect this $b Lilith class cruiser to be in the area. If it is present, scan the cruiser, and any other capital ships you find. Do not engage any ships, or it will ruin the element of surprise. 

Keep a low profile, $f Alpha. Remember to keep at least 500 metres between yourself and the fighter patrols."

6615, "Good work, pilot, you managed to scan the Tulzscha and Nyarlathotep's systems as you requested. Unfortunately, upon your initial broadcast, the GTD Valhalla's strike force launched a pre-emptive assault against the Nyarlathotep without your additional information of the growing battlegroup. We managed to signal her in time to pull out of the attack, but at the cost of burning out her jump engines. At present, the Valhalla is stranded in another part of the nebula.  "

6616, "Unfortunately, you let Aries wing get too close to you before you were able to gather the necessary information. We are no further ahead than when we were before. The Nyarlathotep has changed her location within the Stellar Gas Cloud, and we have no idea where she will be turning up next.

Presently the GTD Valhalla is attempting a deep range scan on the edge of the cloud, but so far is not having any luck. You will join her crew in the ongoing search for the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzcha."

6617, "When your wingmates tell you that Aries wing is getting too close, you need to stop completely and let them pass. If any one of those fighters gets within 200 metres of you, the jig is up and everything goes hostile."

6618, "Pilot, there was no reason for you to leave the area whatsoever. You had not been discovered by the Shivans, and you had not completed your scans of the Nyarlathotep. Your dereliction of duty has cost us dearly, since we know even less than we did before. This is going on your permanent record. 

Get out of my sight."

6671, "Roger that, Command, moving out of their range. "

6672, "What the hell? I just picked up another jump signature. "

6676, "The new ship is a Rakhasa class cruiser. She appears to be wounded too."

6677, "Yeah, but it appears she's healing like the other ships. Looks like our big friend is bringing more people to the party. We're going to need a scan."

6679, "Looks like a small battlegroup. Scan the Cyaegha. This can't wait any longer, we're going to have to contact Command."

"

6688, "Pilots, I'll make this quick, as we don't have much time. As you are aware, once we had obtained the scan data we needed from the $r Shivan vessels rallying where the $h Nyarlathotep is at rest, the $f GTD $f Valhalla was going to lead a pre-emptive strike against the Shivan forces. The $f Valhalla did lead a strike against this position, but ran into severe difficulties."

6689, "Tulzshca"

6690, "The $r Shivan force was much larger than anticipated, and the strike force ran into major problems. We lost over a dozen fighter and bomber wings defending the $f Valhalla and other vessels as they escaped."

6691, "GTVA Wings"

6692, "The $f Valhalla was able to jump out of the area before it was destroyed. However, it took damage to all systems and the engines of the $f Valhalla gave out after the subspace jump. The $f Valhalla's engines can be repaired without the need for new parts, but her fighter complement has been significantly reduced and now the destroyer is under attack again."

6693, "Epsilon"

6694, "This is where you come in. $f Alpha wing will enter the area and provide any assistance to the $f Valhalla until the engines of the destroyer are back up and running and she can depart. Be aware that the $f Valhalla has jumped to the edge of the nebula cloud, so you should be able to get acceptable radar ranges in the field. However, visibility is still limited."

6695, "Once the area is secured, approximately half of the 8,000 crewmembers on board the $f Valhalla will be evacuated in $f escape $f pods. We don't want to risk any more lives on board the $f Valhalla than we have to. Cover the pods as they depart. They have extremely weak hulls and can't take much punishment."

6696, "Escape Pods"

6697, "We're currently trying to get some support for the $f Valhalla, but for the moment you're on your own. There are several other vessels that need to be evacuated from the nebula region and the $f Valhalla can take care of itself. $g GTVI scans haven't located any larger vessels in the immediate vicinity - however, the large number of small signatures suggests multiple fighter and bomber wings incoming.

Get down to the launch bays, pilots. We haven't got enough time to let you choose your loadout, so it has been preassigned. Good luck."

6698, "Good work, Alpha wing. Despite fierce Shivan attacks on your position, you were able to defend the Valhalla unil she was able to repair her engines and jump out of the nebula. Captain Barrach sends you all his thanks for defending his vessel so well."

6699, "The Shivan attack was exceptionally fierce, and we paid heavily for our hasty strike on the Shivan position. The GTD Valhalla was one of the vessels destroyed.  Alpha wing, we were expecting more of you. You had the necessary resources to defeat the Shivans - even their destroyer, the SD Cthon."

6700, "Taurus, Cancer and the Cthon's beam cannon take priority over any other target."

6701, "The presence of a Shivan destroyer in the nebula is both surprising and worrying. It also explains where the large numbers of Shivan fighters and bombers have been coming from. However, a Demon class destroyer is a threat to capital ships in it's own right, as you have seen today. It appears that the Shivan force is larger than we had hoped. We'll need a lot more firepower to deal with this incursion than initially anticipated."

6702, "The non-essential crew were evacuated from the Valhalla without any major losses. Your escort of these vulnerable vessels was top-notch pilots, well done. The crew will rejoin the Valhalla at Tau Sigma station in a day or so."

6703, "Unfortunately, the good news that the Valhalla was saved is tempered by the fact that so many of it's crew lost their lives today. The Shivans cut through our defensive screen of fighters and decimated the escape pods. It shouldn't have been beyond you to stop a few Shivan fighters, pilots."

6704, "Aries and Virgo wings target the pods, so get to them before they get to the escaping crewmen."

6705, "Indeed, nearly 8,000 lives were lost here today, for not only was the Valhalla destroyed by the Shivan onslaught, but her crew were slaughtered by the Shivans as they tried to escape. The Shivans broke though our defensive screen and destroyed many pods. Alpha, it shouldn't have been too difficult to fend off a few Shivan fighters. Even if you couldn't save the Valhalla, you could have saved the pods."

The Failure of Subterfuge

Since we were unable to gain any significant information about the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzscha before the Shivans were alerted to your presence, the GTD Valhalla called off her pre-emptive strike. Instead, we are now engaging in search and destroy operations within the Phi Eridani system. Hopefully we will be able to prevent the Shivans from establishing any kind of foothold in this system. Their resources are limited, and the Nyaralthotep will need to establish supply chains to sustain any kind of territorial operations. If we can prevent those chains from ever forming, then we can ensure that this new problem will be nothing more than a footnote in the GTVA's history with the Shivans."

6773, "$f Alpha, your task is to eliminate the fighter escort and help the $f Escher destroy the $h Tulzscha's engines and communication systems.

She may not have the same value as the $h Nyarlathotep, but she is much more of an asset to us intact."

The $h Nyarlathotep's resources are limited - furthermore, our objective and strategy is to starve the superdestroyer into a trap.

Good hunting, pilot."

Perhaps if we had gained more information in the nebula, things would have worked out differently. Less than a quarter of the Valhalla's crew managed to make it to the escape pods.

Things are far worse than we first imagined, pilot. We are moving to evacuate Phi Eridani, and consolidate our forces in Tau Sigma.

The bomb was an integral part of our defense of the Tau Sigma node - your failings as a pilot allowed the Shivans to sweep it aside completely, before it could do any damage.

Suffice to say, the Shivans have taken Tau Sigma, and eliminated many of our forces fleeing the Eridani node before they could get to safety.

Unfortunately, things have not gone so well elsewhere. As you already know, the GTVA blockade at the Tania Australis node fell apart earlier today, and the Nyarlathotep fleet gained complete access to both Tania Australis and the systems beyond.

It appears they stabilized a previously unknown jump node, and made their way through it. Some twenty Shivan capital ships have suddenly vanished, with only this new mysterious subspace corridor in their wake. We are beginning an extensive patrols and scans of the area, as well as setting up a defensive perimeter around this new jump node. The Shivans could be anywhere."

7113, "Acknowledged, Command. I like my hide where it is, we should be pretty safe in these stealth fighters. You heard him, we'll have to target each ship for two seconds to get a reading."

7114, "Command. This is Beta. We're in Phi Eridani, and we're coming up empty. Not even a stray fighter."

7115, "Are you sure, Beta? "

7116, "As sure as I can get. The Shivans aren't fortifying anything, they seemed to have packed up their bags and gone elsewhere."

7117, "Welcome to elsewhere... Command, the count is in. All three destroyers are here, along with three Corvettes, and fifteen cruisers!"

7118, "Can you verify that Alpha? From our previous encounters, we've recorded only two operational corvettes and a handful of cruisers."

7119, "Would you like me to knock on their exhaust pipes and ask for a headcount? I'm serious Command, all of the Shivans are here!"

7120, "I agree Command, we're also getting nothing out here. Just a bit of Shivan wreckage. Looks like they scuttled several supply ships."

7121, "Acknowledged Kappa. Alpha, are you getting anything on their supply convoy?"

7122, "Nothing, Command. Not even a cargo transport or a container. They're all just... lined up."

7123, "Lined up, Alpha? What do you mean?"

7124, "As in lined up, they're tighly packed in a formation that isn't more than 3000 metres wide and about 6000 metres long. I don't really want to get much closer."

7125, "Acknowledged, Alpha, scan the Corvettes. Scan the navigation systems on the destroyers."

7127, "Dammit, they've seen us!"

7128, "The Azathoth has launched some fighters. They haven't seen us yet, so keep it quiet."

7129, "Command! We have a Shivan Knossos portal in the area... it just materialized in front of the Nyarlathotep! What the hell are they doing?!"

7130, "Say again, Alpha?!"

7131, "Do I have to repeat myself? We have a Knossos portal, clearly of Shivan design that just warped in in front of the Nyarlathotep! Transmitting an image of it now."

7132, "Confirmed, Alpha. Finish those scans if you haven't already, and get yourself to a safe distance to watch what's going on. We're notifying the Cypher."

7133, "Command! I have a massive subspace surge! They're warping out!"

7134, "Can you tell where they're going? They must be going somewhere in system!"

7135, "Negative, Command. My instruments are all over the map, I can't tell where they went. I am getting some really odd readings."

7136, "Confirmed Alpha. We're dispatching the Cypher and the Escher to your position now. Can you get a scan on that Shivan Knossos portal?"

7137, "Negative, Command."

7138, "Why not? Was it destroyed?"

7139, "No sir. It went with them. All we have left is a few stray fighters."

7140, "Say again, Alpha 2? Did you say it warped out with them?"

7141, "Yes, sir. That's confirmed. We were hit with a shockwave when she warped out. My readings are telling me something weird, but I can't confirm until the Cypher gets here."

7142, "Standby, Alpha. The Cypher and Escher should be there shortly to relieve you. Secure the area in the meantime."

7143, "Affirmative, Command. I'm going to have to do some overtime at the bar after this one."

7144, "We're on station, Alpha. What have you got for us?"

7145, "Nothing physical, Cypher. But can you confirm a reading I have with your instruments? I have a strong subspace signature here."

7146, "We're getting it too, Alpha 2. Does this say what I think it says?"

7147, "That we're now sitting next to a brand new stable jump node? Looks like it."

7148, "Damn... Okay, we're calling this one in. Return to base, Alpha, you've done all you can."

7149, "Roger that, Cypher, see you back home!"

7150, "Okay, all the destroyers are here."

7151, "Three corvettes? I don't think we've seen the Hastur before."

7152, "My count is eight cruisers so far, there's a lot more of them... "

7158, "Tania Australis
GTD Macura
A Second Tour of Duty

Welcome back to GTVI, pilot. As you are now well aware, we have need of your abilities once again. You join us under very different circumstances to your last assignment with Special Operations Command. With the threat presented by the Shivans increasing and spreading into our core systems, we can no longer bide our time but must act quickly.

Our objective over the next series of operations is the destruction of the Morgan Technologies defence force and the capture of its command vessel, the MTD Auriga."

7159, "Motivations Behind the Conflict

Morgan Technologies sought to gain control of the Tau Sigma system in order to exploit the high potential of the system. The corporation attempted to destabilise the region and undermine GTVA control with a series of strikes on civilian targets by hired mercenaries. The MT defence force was intended to replace the GTVA as dominant military power in the system once Morgan had the second thing they wanted - the two million Capellan refugees settling in Tau Sigma. With the refugees and control of the system, they had themselves a ready-made empire."

7160, "MT Warrant

The Auriga and other MT vessels participated in attacks on civilian and GTVA forces and showed no mercy to their enemies. The GTVA considers these forces to be guilty of crimes against the Alliance and war crimes under the provisions of civilian protection decree in BETAC. The Security Council issued a warrant for the capture or destruction of the MT vessels yesterday. The Auriga and her accompanying flotilla must be brought to justice."

7161, "Our search for the $h Auriga and the other $r MT military vessels begins in $b Tania $b Australis, the last known location of the $r Morgan $r Technologies destroyer. Our scouts believe that an $r MT vessel has been sighted near $b Wayfarer $b Station, and so you're going in to take a closer look."

7162, "$b Wayfarer $b Station is the largest artificial structure in $b Tania $b Australis, and is the principal stop-off point for a large number of fringe-dwelling miners, explorer vessels and less savoury elements of society. It is also, unfortunately, the location at which the $r MT vessel was sighted. You're going to be flying into a potential combat situation in which there will be a lot of civilian targets. This complicates matters a great deal."

7163, "Wayfarer Station"

7164, "You will be flying a $b Perseus fighter and be assisted by $f Beta wing, also flying $b Perseus interceptors. We weren't able to get a positive ID on the $r Morgan vessel, so your primary objective will be to identify the $r MT ship among the other targets. Once this has been achieved, try to disable it so that the recovery craft $f Giordano can extract the vessel's crew.  "

7165, "MT Vessel"

7166, "Cover the $f Giordano during the recovery op and prevent the destruction of the $r MT ship if possible. If the $b Wayfarer security forces present any opposition, you have limited authority to return fire. Do not destroy these civilian security vessels under any circumstances. However, $r Morgan fighters are fair game. Hopefully, once we have the $r MT prisoners our interrogations will yield positive results."

7167, "Giordano"

7168, "You failed to identify and capture the Morgan Technolgies vessel. Though traffic was high, this was a relatively simple task that you should've been able to complete with only basic training. The fact that you're a pilot of some skill highlights the fact that you should've carried out your mission objectives properly."

7169, "Scan all ships for MT crew until they are discovered. Follow your wingmen's suggestions as well."

7170, "Deserting the field is a serious enough offence in any mission - and a covert operation with high tactical value even more so. You failed the mission, your wingmen, and, worst of all, us at GTVI. Don't think that you'll be selected for special duties again, pilot."

7171, "You did well out there considering what we had to put up with - flying in a hot zone with many civilian targets, mistaken identity by the local security personnel, and an attack by mysterious fighters. Flying in this kind of environment always presents danger to our pilots and also to the civilians who we are sworn to protect. The risk of a shot hitting a civilian freighter or explorer is high in this kind of mission, but fortunately you showed skill and restraint, even when under fire from friendly forces. This isn't something that every pilot can boast."

7172, "The crew of the disabled MTT Juno isn't talking under conventional questioning methods, and because they're not strictly military personnel we're going to need special authorisation from GTVI HQ in Ikeya if we want to continue our inquiry. This could take some time. Nevertheless, the capture of this crew is a significant step forward. You did well out there, protecting our transport from the unwanted attention of hostile fighters. Their origin remains unknown, though it's a safe bet to assume that they were MT or pirate fighters."

7173, "The wanton destruction of the MT transport before the Giordano even had a chance to dock with it is simply unacceptable. We expect our pilots to show intelligence and restraint, and yet you have shown neither of these traits. It makes me wonder why they ever asked you back to serve again in the first place."

7174, "Don't destroy the MT transport, disable it! The crew is needed for interrogation."

7175, "The destruction of the GTT Giordano prevented us from retrieving the Morgan Technologies crew from the Juno, and so we've lost a valuable lead in addition to the loss of a fine capture crew. Lieutenant Commander Phil Barker and his team will be sorely missed by their colleagues and their families."

7176, "Protect the Juno and Giordano during docking. After that, you'll just have to concern yourself with the Giordano. She's weak, so don't let the fighters get through."

The last transmission from the convoy stated that they were under attack and that several vessels had been disabled.

7324, "It would also be reasonable to assume that were there anything out there to salvage, $r Morgan might come back and finish what they started. The convoy possesses considerable defensive firepower but their status is unknown and if $r MT ships attack, you will be called upon to defend friendly targets in the area.

You're going out into an unknown, possibly volatile situation. Tread carefully and keep your wits about you."

7325, "MT Forces?"

7326, "Alpha and Beta wings performed acceptably in a combat situation in which details were not readily available. Because of your efforts, the recovery craft were all able to dock and escape safely with the crews of the stricken convoy craft. By all rights this situation shouldn't even have happened. The method by which Morgan Technologies obtained the co-ordinates of the convoy remains unexplained.

However, it would seem that all of your effort was in vain. The Vaisang, Kucedre and Adjmetu didn't show up at the designated rally point, and have failed to do so in the intervening hours. Our search teams have found nothing to suggest they didn't make it - not even debris. The three recovery transports, their crews and those of the convoy craft have simply vanished. Command can give no valid explanation for this."

7327, "The freighters Emza and Selu both escaped with their crews. This may only be a small number of personnel to survive, but if our operations have saved only one person then they have not been in vain."

7328, "The recovery craft were destroyed along with the crews of the convoy craft by MT bombers and other, unknown attackers. Without the accounts of the crews, and with the surviving convoy craft so badly damaged as to be useless, we may never know quite what happened out there. You let down hundreds of Terrans and Vasudans out there, pilots."

7329, "Defend the convoy craft from all attack.  By delivering slight damage to fighters you can provoke them to break off their attacks."

7330, "We have not been able to determine the origin of your mysterious attackers either, though they do not appear to be MT vessels or belong to any local pirates.

The bitter lessons of the past should teach us hard truths for the future, yet time and again the human race has failed to learn from its mistakes, rise up to the challenges set by new situations and new enemies. In our arrogance we have believed for centuries that no enemy will survive contact with our plans. In truth no plan of ours will survive contact with the enemy. Pride comes before a fall, and we have been proud and have fallen many times during the past 50 years. There are simply too many variables to consider when planning an appropriate strategy. Ultimately the battle will be won and lost due to the tactical decisions made by those on the front lines.

7558, "Delphi 2372
GTD Macura
A Final Confrontation

Enough is enough. In spite of the mysterious roadblocks we've encountered, we have finally found a way to draw out the MTD Auriga. She has caused us a great number of problems over the past few weeks, from interfering with searches for the Shivans to massacring civilians and raiding scientific installations with no apparent method behind the madness. Although it is only one vessel, the Auriga has caused more damage than some small NTF battlegroups did at the height of the war. Now, we must deal with the Auriga."

7559, "Capabilities of the Auriga

The Auriga is an immensely powerful vessel, armed with heavy beam cannons and capable of far more damage than a normal Orion class destroyer. It is also protected by a limited self-repair mechanism and a beam cannon inhibition device. These pose great problems to our forces when attempting to combat the vessel."

7560, "Beam Inhibitor Technology

We now know that the inhibitor works by disrupting our ion beams with electromagnetic radiation as they form, causing them to collapse. This effect prevents friendly vessels from firing, while the Auriga itself remains unaffected. The technology appears to have been developed around the framework for Admiral Bosch's ETAK design."

7561, "Beam Cannon Workaround

Fortunately, sensor scans of the Auriga, coupled with our knowledge of the ETAK project and other pieces of data from captured MT Elite Guard crews have helped us a great deal. We believe that we have enough information to temporarily negate the beam cannon inhibitor. This will enable us to launch an attack on the Auriga on roughly even footing.

On the orders of GTVI, we are now initiating an operation to neutralise the threat posed by the Auriga."

7562, "Intelligence Directives

GTVI wants the Auriga captured, not destroyed. This will not only eliminate the threat posed by the MT destroyer, but it will give us a powerful and much-needed tool with which to fight the Shivans. The motives of the crew of the Auriga remain shrouded in mystery.  As you'd expect, GTVI want to know their motives as well."

7563, "The Auriga's Value

The Auriga is a technological treasure trove of designs thought lost during the GTI Rebellion thirty-seven years ago, plus experimental technologies that we weren't even sure were possible. How all of this found its way onto a corporate destroyer is a mystery. GTVI also believe that the Auriga has the power to take on the Nyarlathotep."

Capturing this vessel will be a tough job, but it may be our only hope. Our best pilots have therefore been picked for the job. Get down to the briefing room, Alpha. You're going to play an instrumental role in this mission."

7565, "Alright, pilots, let's get right down to business. The $h MTD $h Auriga is cornered in $b Delphi, from which there is no apparent escape route. The only node discovered in this system thus far is too unstable for subspace travel. The $g 3rd $g Battle $g Group has been directed to assist us in this operation, so we have considerable resources available."

7566, "However, the $h Auriga will not reveal itself readily. The vessel has proven on too many occasions already it's capacity for evasion.

Fortunately our scouts have located a temporary supply depot set up by a forward group of $r MT vessels on the edge of the $b Delphi system. It is hoped that a strike at the depot will draw the $h Auriga out to defend the supplies and guard vessels."

7567, "Supply depot"

7568, "The supply depot is guarded by an $b Aeolus cruiser, the $h MTC $h Minerva, and one wing of fighters, designated $h Halberd. The supply depot attack force will consist of the $f GVCv $f Andrasta and two fighter wings, $f Alpha and $f Beta."

7569, "Minerva"

7570, "Halberd"

7571, "In order for our plan to work, we need at least one important $r MT vessel to survive the attack so that the $h Auriga can rescue it. $f Alpha and $f Beta will therefore engage the fighters and destroy the cargo. However, the $h Minerva must not be destroyed. She'll be used to bait the $h Auriga out into the open."

7572, "When the $h Auriga arrives, our trap will be sprung. The $f Andrasta will signal the $f GVD $f Luxor and our additional fighter and bomber reinforcements to enter the field of engagement. The $f Luxor is carrying modified sensor equipment which should allow our vessels to fire their beam weapons despite the $h Auriga's beam cannon inhibitor. The $f Luxor has also been given additional ablative armour to increase resistance to the $h Auriga's attacks."

Destroy all other $r MT combat vessels in the area. We don't want any scattered vessels causing us trouble once this operation is over.

The bomber wings, consisting of $f Delta and $f Epsilon are most at risk. The $h Auriga has a large complement of advanced fighters which the bombers must be defended from."

Unfortunately, all of our preparation was for naught and the GVD Luxor has been heavily damaged.  She'll be in drydock for a month or more while the engineers fit a whole new engine array and repair the secondary damage.

However, we were able to overcome the Auriga's beam inhibition device and attack the destroyer directly. This technology will come in handy should we have to face the Auriga again. Our scientists hope to adapt the device to inhibit the beams of hostile vessels in the future as well."

7581, "Despite the failure of our primary objective, we were able to destroy all remaining Morgan Technologies vessels. The MT defence force has effectively been destroyed, the Auriga being the only surviving vessel."

7582, "Not only did the Auriga escape but we were unable to destroy the remainder of the Morgan Technologies defence forces. Although a small group, we will still have to expend time, energy and vessels to track them down, and at a time when the Shivan fleet is pushing into our core systems, these are resources we can ill afford to waste.

Nevertheless, the threat posed by the MT defence force is effectively over."

7583, "Destroy the Minerva before it can escape, and make sure all fighters and bombers are accounted for."

7584, "You survived a highly hazardous engagement, pilots, that many others did not. While we will mourn those who died on board the Andrasta and the GTT Gabriel, there is no time to waste now. We must strike at the Shivan fleet before they can devastate our systems.

The Shivans, it appears, have infiltrated deep into GTVA populated systems. All available forces are moving to defend the populated worlds in that system. At this moment, long-range patrols from the 8th have entered Sirius from the newly formed jump node, pursuing the Shivan advance."

7654, "Shivan Motivations

What the Shivans are after at this point is unclear. Their pattern of movement appears different from their previous engagements where they have made strikes against populated areas, or established supply lines. However, GTVA Command is not taking any chances, evacuating civilian targets perceived to be at risk, and drawing the Shivans away from these vulnerable targets."

7655, "Your Place in the Conflict

Given your experience and proven record against the Shivans in Tau Sigma, you and other pilots from the 212th Silver Scythes have been assigned for active duty in pursuing the Nyarlathotep. You will rendezvous with the 8th Vasudan Battlegroup flagship GVD Khefrem and the Terran destroyer GTD Ignatius where you will be assigned your first mission."

7656, "The $f GVD $f Khefrem and ships from the $g 8th $g Vasudan Battlegroup arrived in $b Sirius some six hours ago. The $f Khefrem came through the newly-stabilized jump node in $b Tau $b Sigma, following her own long-range patrols. Apparently this node was mapped many years ago, but was too unstable for even small probes to use. After conducting extensive operations in $b Tau $b Sigma, as well as the recent patrols in $b Sirius, the Vasudan destroyer is in need of fresh supplies. "

7657, "Prior to making its rendezvous with the $f GTD $f Ignatius, the $f Khefrem will be taking on supplies and a new wing of fighters from the $f GVD $f Nekhbet. Once these are secured, the $f Khefrem will then join the $f Ignatius in searching for the main $r Shivan fleet. We have to play this carefully, as a direct, unprepared confrontation with the $h SD $h Nyarlathotep, or even the $h SD $h Cthon or $h SD $h Azathoth could prove disastrous."

The bulk of the Shivan signals appear to be coming from a low orbit near one of Sirius' large gas giants. They have been using the atmosphere to hide their fleet, and no doubt to refuel. Beyond the signal triangulation, we have little more information than what we already have. 

Your task is to get yourself within 200 metres of any cruiser that you find, and give us the precise coordinates and heading of that vessel. We realize this will be a tricky prospect, given that your ships have already seen heavy combat, and cruisers carry anti-fighter systems. However, keep the fighters off your tail and keep moving, and we will take care of the rest.

Additionally, break off the operation immediately if there is any sign of a corvette or destroyer. "

7724, "This was a very risky mission pilot. As you can see, even a small group Shivan cruisers can be an extreme danger to our forces. When you identified the Zoth as being a Lilith Class Cruiser, we elected to send in the Ignatius to hit the group as hard as we could."

7725, "Unfortunately, the Ignatius was destroyed with all hands. This mission was not impossible, pilot. With the loss of this destroyer, we have seriously compromised our ability to meet the Shivan threat."

7726, "The biggest single threat to the Ignatius is the Large Shivan Beam turret on the SC Zoth. Use Trebuchet missiles if possible to destroy the turret after the Ignatius arrives. If you do not have Trebuchets, concentrate your fire on the turret, it can take a beating."

7727, "Congratulations, pilot. The SC Zoth, SC Bokrug, and SC Mi-go were all destroyed in this risky strike. As you can see, even the firepower of Shivan cruisers is never to be underestimated. Without your assistance, the Zoth may have been able to outflank the Ignatius. This was an opportunity that we may not see again."

7728, "Command informs me that the Shivans have now come out of hiding in the system and are gathering for a strike. The GVD Nekhbet is supervising the defense of the inner colony worlds, while our forces will be tracking the Shivan fleet's movements and responding accordingly. Consider yourself warned.

Shivan Retaliation

After the successful strike against the cruisers orbiting Sirius XII, the Shivans began to move. Fearing the worst, we allocated our heaviest armaments to defend the inhabited worlds, led by the GVD Nekhbet. All non-essential personnel were evacuated from space-borne installations, and planetary defenses were placed on highest alert. When the Shivans came, we would put up a hell of a fight."

7766, "Unorthodox Tactics

But they never did.

The Shivans were moving, to be sure, but the same systematic tactics we saw nearly four decades ago were nowhere to be seen. The GVD Khefrem and GTD Ignatius continued their search. It seemed the hand of destruction had spared Sirius, if only for the moment. That hope was short lived."

7767, "Assault on the Shipyards

Less than an hour ago, the Shivans materialized near the Castellan Shipyards, stationed adjacent to the Sirius-Deneb jump node. The evacuation of the shipyard was still in progress under the direction of the GTD Guardia. The SD Azathoth appeared first, crippling the destroyer almost immediately. The rest of the Shivans followed, and while many of our people fought valiantly to cover the escape of shipyard personnel, I am afraid to report that casualties are in the thousands. That having been said, this could have been much worse."

Several have made it to safe zones within $b Sirius, but another group of ships fled through the jump node into $b Deneb. We have just received a distress call from the $f GTCv $f Epicurus, a corvette escorting a handful of ships, including two medical cruisers, assigned to evacuate the $f Castellan crews.

However, the damage to her jump drive is not as severe as the corvette, and it can be repaired with one of our crews. This is important, given that the number of escapees on board is more than can be handled with our available rescue craft. Due to our recent arrival in system, we are the nearest unattached unit that can oversee the rescue effort."

We're tracking the Nyarlathotep and its accompanying armada as we speak, and hope to implement a plan of action within the day. Be prepared to be called back up for duty at any moment."

Ten days ago the SD Nyarlathotep opened a stable jump corridor between the Tau Sigma and Sirius systems. While the GTVA Science Corps had known about this corridor previously, it was then far too unstable to travel safely. It appears that the Nyarlathotep stabilised the corridor somehow.

The potential for such a technology should we be able to replicate it is enormous - more so even than the technology of the Knossos portal."

The majority of the Shivan battlegroup has since moved out of Sirius and through Deneb, into Vega. They have not stopped to pursue any targets of opportunity unless they stood in the path of their relentless advance, as the shipyards in Sirius did. Fortunately the personnel and the photon artillery prototype under development there were successfully evacuated before the shipyard was destroyed.

While most of the Shivan capital ships have moved on to Vega, the Ravana class destroyer Azathoth and several smaller vessels remain in Deneb. We must now attempt to flush them out."

The arrival of the Shivans has brought an interesting phenomenon to light. It seems that the Nyarlathotep is still broadcasting some kind of signal to all Shivan vessels, which, it has been postulated, the Shivan vessels in the Phi Eridani stellar gas cloud homed in on. The signal has also been picked up by a Rakshasa class cruiser that the GTVI captured during the Second Great War."

7823, "Science Corps Suggestion

After analyzing the behaviour of the Shivans, Doctor James Sheridan, an eminent scientist in the field of Shivan research, believes that we can lure the Shivans into a trap using the cruiser as bait. With any luck, the Shivans will attempt to rescue their stricken cruiser, and thus open themselves up to attack. The instrument of their destruction will be the GTVX Gorgon cannon, the most powerful defensive weapon ever constructed by the GTVA Science Corps.

An extract of Doctor Sheridan's report on the Gorgon cannon follows."

7824, "Extract from Doctor Sheridan's Report

''A standard Meson bomb detonates without focus and spreads its massive destructive power in a large spherical area. By stripping out and modifying a Zephyrus class vessel, it can be used to focus the Meson charge into a coherent beam with incredible destructive potential. While the cannon is fragile and unstable, no vessel of destroyer class or below can withstand the power that it unleashes.''

We're going to be putting this to the test soon. Report to mission briefing, pilots."

7825, "$g Command has authorised the deployment of the $f GTVX $f Gorgon experimental cannon for this operation. As you have heard, the cannon focuses the energy released during a Meson reaction into a coherent beam. Although the beam is powerful, the cannon itself has a low damage threshold. It is for this reason that we are deploying a considerable defensive force to protect the $f Gorgon."

7826, "Gorgon Cannon"

7827, "You're part of that force, $f Alpha wing. The $f Gorgon will be defended by $f Alpha and $f Delta wings and the cruisers $f GTC $f Hyperion and $f GVCv $f Jilvaa. Due to the importance of this mission, you will be permitted to carry the $b UD-8 $b Kayser cannon, our most powerful primary cannon.

Bear in mind that while your primary objective will be to protect the $f Gorgon cannon, we would like the cruisers back in one piece if at all possible. We have more fronts than just this one to fight on, and we need every capital ship we can get."

Despite being crewless, its computers continue to respond to the $r Shivan signal. Our engineers stripped the cruiser of most of it's weapons and engine assembly long ago. This will at least prevent the $r Shivans from using the vessel against us or any autopilot taking over and forcing the cruiser to depart. Instead, the $r Shivans will have to come and get the cruiser themselves."

7831, "Nodens"

7832, "Our captured cruiser has already attracted some $r Shivan attention. While only fighters have yet arrived, heavier support is sure to follow soon. The $r Shivans have attacked all $g GTVA vessels nearby, so it will be the job of $f Alpha and $f Delta to intercept any incoming fighters or bombers. Vessels attacking the $f Gorgon are to be given top priority. Everything else can take care of itself."

7834, "If, or when, we lure the $r Shivan capital ships out of hiding, the $f GTVX $f Gorgon will handle them. The initiation sequence for a sustained blast from the cannon is considerable and your wings will be expected to fend off the $r Shivans until then. Don't engage the $r Shivan capital ships and don't get caught in the $f Gorgon's beam. The effects will be permanent, to say the least."

7836, "The instability of the $f Gorgon must be constantly compensated for to prevent a critical overload of the cannon's main reaction chambers and power regulators. It is for this reason that the cannon must be manned, however dangerous this may be. Defend the cannon at all costs, $f Alpha. The twenty-three technicians and scientists on board will be counting on you to get them through this.

Get down to the loading bays, $f Alpha. It's time to bag ourselves some $r Shivans."

It was only thanks to the quick action of the crew of the GTVX Gorgon cannon that we were able to eliminate the Shivan destroyer. It is the first major victory we can claim.

However, this victory comes at a price. The GVCv Jilvaa was annihilated by the Azathoth and the crew of the Gorgon cannon were killed in a Meson containment breach that destroyed the cannon. The loss of the prototype may be a blow, but it is the loss of life that is most terrible."

7838, "The GTVX Gorgon cannon was destroyed by the Shivans, killing all 23 on board. We were only able to destroy the SC Chaugnar and as a result to Shivan fleet remains strong. The destruction of a vessel such as the SCv Hastur would have provided some relief for our hard-pressed forces.

We're received news that our operation to destroy the SD Azathoth also failed. The Shivan vessel destroyed the GTCv Endurance and moved into Vega, to join the rest of the Shivan fleet. Things do not bode well for the Alliance."

Be glad that you were not there, pilot. What we have on our hands is a rout. Without taking a single capital ship loss, the $r Shivans have already wiped out all of our fighter wings, three of our corvettes, and damaged three of our larger vessels."

Your problem is not here, pilot."

7904, "It is here, some thirty kilometres away from the battle. 

Unfortunately, the $f GTFf $f Cypher sustained damage to its subspace drive when it activated the jump and found itself adrift still within sight of the battle. Two cruisers, the $h SC $h Zhar and the $h SC $h Dhole, along with fighter and bomber wings, have broken away from the fleet and are moving to intercept."

7905, "The damage to the $f Cypher's subspace engine is not critical, and would be reasonably easy to repair otherwise. However, the $f Cypher suffered a hull breach from a beam in its engineering section, killing several critical personnel and rendering any repair equipment unusable. The $f GTT $f Minos is already enroute with a backup repair crew. Once aboard they will be able to bring the engines back online and leave the area. "

7907, "$f Alpha, your task is simple. Make sure that the $f Cypher makes it out alive. The $h SC $h Dhole and the $h SC $h Zhar are closing fast, and will be within beam range within minutes. Either disable, disarm, or destroy these cruisers before they get within beam range. Additionally, watch for bombers. We have already discovered that there are a handful of wings in this battle armed with extremely high-yield bombs. Don't let them get near the $f Cypher."

7908, "This engagement was a disaster pilots. Not only did we lose the GVCv Ennead and the GVD Resheph, but the GTD Ignatius was destroyed while covering the escape of the GVD Khefrem. These losses are much more than we are capable of handling, but alas, there was nothing you could have done in this battle, except help save the GTFf Cypher..."

7909, "...which you did admirably. The frigate jumped to safety, and is under repairs as we prepare for our next engagement.

We're going to need your skills again very soon, pilot. "

7910, "...which you failed to do. The Cypher was destroyed by the incoming bombers and cruisers, and you were unable to stop them. 

Dismissed."

7911, "The sequence will be to eliminate the SC Dhole, then bombers (especially the Helios carrying Seraphim), and then concentrate on destroying the Zhar. Don't bother disabling these craft, destroy them outright. Also be wary of more bombers after the cruisers are destroyed."

7955, "I'm guessing they have as much hitting power as a Helios, let's take them down now!"

7956, "Alpha, those Seraphim are getting too close. They're launching their bombs!"

7957, "We're taking a pounding, Alpha! Get these Shivans off our back so we can get out of here in one piece!"

7958, "Alpha, we're going critical! Another major hit, and we're done for!"

7961, "Feeling naked on a windy day, Minos. We're glad to see you. You're cleared to dock. Just watch your heads."

7962, "Affirmative, Cypher. Moving to dock. "

7963, "Hey! Alpha, the Shivans are using us for target practice here. We need some cover!"

7964, "Crap! The Minos has gone down! Abort mission! Cypher, you're going to have to abandon ship! Everybody return to base!"

7965, "Alpha, our engines are back online. The crew of the Minos is moving to undock. "

7966, "That's it, Cypher. You're clear and good to go. See you back at the rendezvous point."

Alpha wing is part of the team defending the Beta Aquilae jump node, near to Rebus Station, where most of the action is expected - including an engagement with the SD Cthon, the primary target of Alpha's bombers.
"

Rebus Station
The Shivan Armada's Procession

Since the Shivan fleet jumped into the Sirius system just over a week ago and began their journey through our systems, we have desperately been trying to hold them off, slow them down, or thin them out. However, our operations have met with only limited success. While we were able to destroy the SD Azathoth with the GTVX Gorgon cannon in Deneb, we lost the prototype and several other vessels."

7971, "The Vega Engagement

In a recent engagement, an attempt to destroy the Shivan fleet failed, with the destruction of the GVD Resheph and GTD Ignatius as the result. Several smaller vessels were also destroyed and we barely dented the fleet. The official death toll stands at over 23,000, with many more missing and presumed dead. Obviously, with conventional attacks failing another method must be found to deal with the Shivans."

7972, "Unconventional Warfare

Command believes that it has discovered just such a method. A Deimos-class corvette under construction here in Vega has been modified to carry only a skeleton crew and a payload of Meson bombs. This vessel, the GTCv Argentus will be used to ram the Nyarlathotep. It is hoped that the vulnerabilities observed in the Lucifer's reactors could be capitalised upon here, though we have one available to us - the Nyarlathotep does not appear to have the same shielding that the Lucifer did."

7973, "The Ultimate Destination

We will therefore not have to destroy the Nyarlathotep within a subspace corridor and risk losing the ability to travel through the jump node, but the Shivans will not simply let us ram the Argentus into their command ship unopposed.  After monitoring Shivan fleet movements our experts believe that the Shivans' movement patterns are consistent with travel to only one destination - Beta Aquilae.  It is at the Beta Aquilae-Vega jump node that we will mount our attack on the Nyarlathotep."

7974, "New Technology

It will be a difficult task to eliminate the Nyarlathotep, but fortunately our defence forces have a new tool to aid them - the GTB Hydra. The Hydra is a next-generation refit of the GTB Artemis, a true fighter-bomber with improved armour, maneuvrability and afterburner reserves. The Hydra can also mount the UD-8 Kayser cannon, making it a formidable foe to enemy capital ships and fighters alike."

7975, "Combat Evaluation

The Hydra has been brought into service early due to the threat posed by the Shivans, so you'll be 'testing' her, so to speak, as the Hydra hasn't had an OpEval period. Use her well - basic flight trials have shown excellent potential in the vessel.

Get down to the Quarterdeck, they're waiting for you."

7976, "We mount our final set of missions in order to ensure the success of $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet commencing at 1400 hours today. The $b 144th and $f GVD $f Khefrem will flank the $r Shivan fleet while the $b 23rd provide cover for our forward observer units monitoring $r Shivan movement. The $g Vegan $g 4th $g Fleet is providing logistical support across the system and you pilots from the $b 232nd will be participating in the most critical phase of our operation, here, at the $b Beta $b Aquilae jump node."

7977, "The $b Beta $b Aquilae jump node lies between $b Vega $b IV and its moon, $b Larissa. Due to the intense gravitational forces exerted by these two bodies, ships must exit subspace some distance from the node. This means that the $r Shivans will have quite some distance to run before they can enter our core systems. The $r Shivans must pass through this area in order to enter $b Beta $b Aquilae, and it is here that $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet will take place."

If at all possible all $r Shivan incursion further into our systems must be stopped. You have been equipped with $b TAG missiles. Use them to paint targets for our defence cannons to lock onto and destroy.  "

7988, "Argentus"

7989, "However, our primary target will be the $h SD $h Cthon. The $b Demon class destroyer will be the $r Shivans' primary fire support vessel, housing many wings of fighters and bombers. Armed with powerful beam cannons, the $h Cthon will be more than capable of ripping our defences to pieces if we're not careful - not to mention the $f Argentus. $f Alpha and $f Beta wings, in bombers, will be charged with the destruction of this vessel. Again, once the destroyer is within range the $b Mjolnir cannons will add considerable fire support if you are able to TAG the $h Cthon for them."

7990, "Once the $f Argentus arrives, cover it from $r Shivan bombers and beam cannon fire. The $f Argentus must reach the $h Nyarlathotep in order to complete its mission. Ensure that the $f Argentus survives long enough to destroy the $h Nyarlathotep at any cost. All other objectives are secondary, as unless we can destroy the $r Shivan command vessel with this attack it is highly unlikely that our efforts to destroy it by more conventional means will succeed. However, note that the $f Argentus will explode with considerable force. Get out of harm's way if possible. Courageous pilots are one thing, martyrs quite another."

7991, "When the $h Nyarlathotep is destroyed, mop up any remaining $r Shivan vessels, making sure that the defence of surviving allied capital ships is paramount.

This is it, everyone. We stop the $r Shivans here with $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet's success or we unleash a wave of terror and destruction upon our core worlds, one from which the $g GTVA may never recover.

You have your orders, now do your people proud out there, pilots. You're making history here."

7992, "The SD Cthon broke through our defences at the Beta Aquilae jump node and entered that system. Already our forces there have sustained considerable damage in fending it and it's bomber wings off. We expect many more losses to come if something is not done quickly."

7993, "Disable the Cthon with bombs if you need to. That ship cannot get through to Beta Aquilae!"

7994, "Well done pilots. The Cthon has been destroyed - but we have no laurels for you to rest on. A situation is rapidly developing elsewhere in Vega and if we don't respond immediately, we are all doomed.

8106, "Command, this is the Cypher. I think you might want to take a look at what's going on over here..."

8107, "Say again, Cypher? Have you encountered resistance?"

8108, "There's no time! Scramble the fighters! Scramble EVERYTHING!"

8109, "Pilots, stand by, it looks like we're going to have to look into this more closely."

8110, "I knew I was right!"

8111, "Shut up, Mackie! Let's get back to base, pronto!"

8112, "The Shivans' guns are damaging our hull. Stop some of their fire or we're done for!"

8113, "Galahad is down! We have lost the GTC Galahad!"

8114, "The Cthon has made the jump to subspace! We've lost our chance now, get back to base and let's see if we can limit damage."

8117, "Hail Mary..."

8118, "The final countdown...
"

8119, "Sorry to shove you into a brand-new $b Hydra and brief you while enroute, but we don't have time. It looks like Lt. Mackie and the crew of the $f GTFf $f Cypher were right, and now we have very little time to act. The $h SD $h Nyarlathotep, and her accompanying fleet, were never on a course for $b Beta $b Aquilae, but were attempting to return home. It now appears that they might just succeed. The $h SD $h Cthon and the bulk of the $r Shivan fleet engaged our forces near the $b Beta $b Aquilae node. We destroyed the $h Cthon and seem to have the rest of that battle under control, but we may have lost the war. "

8120, "The $h Nyarlathotep is attempting to stabilize the jump node to $b Capella, which was destroyed five years ago when the $f GTD $f Nereid was detonated inside the corridor. The explosion destabilized the node, and stopped a massive $r Shivan fleet from pushing further into $g GTVA space. From our experience at the new $b Tau $b Sigma-Sirius corridor, if the $h Nyarlathotep is successful, the door to $b Capella will once again be flung wide open. We have one last hope, or we will all face annihilation."

8121, "Capella"

8122, "The $f GTFf $f Cypher has engaged the small fleet guarding the $h Nyarlathotep at the remnants of the $b Capella jump node. She has bought us enough time to rally the $f GVD $f Khefrem and the $f GVCv $f Estennu to provide support for the $f GTCv $f Argentus to make her run. $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet may still have some life after all.

The $f Cypher has transmitted the coordinates for the superdestroyer. The $h Nyarlathotep is engaging with her weapons, but not maneuvering. It appears she must remain still in order to summon their own $b Knossos portal from subspace, and shortly thereafter stabilize the node. Our window for opportunity will be very narrow, and we will only get one shot."

8123, "In order to make this happen, our first order of business is getting the $f Cypher to safety. She is presently within beam range of several $r Shivan cruisers, and is in a direct firefight with the $h SCv $h Cthulhu. The $h Nyarlathotep has launched bombers, which are presently bearing down on the frigate. The $f Cypher is attempting to move out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep, but will need cover as soon as you arrive. "

8124, "The $f Cypher is transmitting the coordinates of the $h Nyarlathotep directly to the skeleton crew of the $f Argentus. If she is destroyed, the explosives-laden corvette will not be able to make her run. You must ensure that the $f Cypher makes it safely out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep or any capital ships in the area. The $f Khefrem and $f Estennu will provide fire support against the cruisers - your task is to intercept any bombers."

8125, "Estennu"

8126, "The $h Nyarlathotep is not unguarded. In addition to her own formidable weaponry, the $h SC $h Nyogtha and $h SC $h Tulzscha, a pair of $b Lilith class cruisers, flank her. They are armed with exceptionally powerful beam weapons, and are guarding her more vulnerable underside. Once the $f Cypher has made it to safety, the beam weapons of these cruisers are your primary target. Either destroy the turret or destroy the cruiser - just make sure they cannot fire. The $b Liliths are a tough nut to crack, so be careful in your choice of action."

8127, "Additionally, the $h Nyarlathotep's rear-most beam weapon has a field of fire that covers her underside. While not as devastating as her principal forward beams, this weapon is as powerful as the lateral cannons, and is still a major threat. If the $f Argentus is to succeed in her mission, this threat must also be eliminated."

8128, "Rear Turret"

8129, "Once these cannons are eliminated, the $f Argentus will make her attack run on the $h Nyarlathotep. Keep any stray fighters or bombers clear of her, but be careful. When the $f Argentus collides with the superdestroyer, the blast will destroy any small craft in the area. Do what you have to to succeed, but come home if you can."

8130, "I need not stress the consequences of failure, as the reopening of the $b Capella jump node will spell certain doom for all civilization as we know it. 

Go with God, pilot."

8160, "No one's arguing with you now, Mackie. Let's do this. Cypher, Alpha, Beta, Delta and Epsilon wings are moving to give you cover."

8161, "Thanks, Command, we're managing not too badly. We managed to stay in the Nyarlathotep's blind spot, but her escort are giving us a bit of trouble. We need to get clear soon, and there are incoming bombers."

8162, "Cypher, this is the Khefrem. Targeting cruisers, get yourself to safety. We will cover you."

8163, "Affirmative, Khefrem, we're going to need to get things cleared up for the Argentus."

8164, "At least the Cthon isn't here. We'd be in a lot more trouble than we are now."

8165, "You don't call this trouble? Kid, if that ship restablizes the node, we'll have a lot more than the Cthon to worry about. "

8166, "We're lucky to have the Khefrem and the Estennu - even then, the odds aren't great."

8167, "Shut up about the odds and get to work. I don't gamble. We need to clear that path for the Cypher."

8168, "The Cthulhu is down, the corvette has been eliminated, but there are still several cruisers out there. Keep it sharp people."

8169, "The Sathla has been destroyed. Keep up the pressure, the Argentus is standing by."

8170, "The SC Tindalos has been neutralized."

8171, "That's the rear guard, Alpha. Eliminate what's left of the bombers, and then move to take out the beam cannons."

8172, "Fight well for us, Alpha. We've done what we can."

8173, "Damn, we've lost the Estennu."

8174, "The Khefrem has gone down! Repeat, the Khefrem has gone down!"

8175, "Dear God, I hope some of them made it to the escape pods."

8176, "Let's make sure her sacrifice was not in vain. I just hope that she's bought us enough time to do this."

8177, "We're out of range now, Alpha, get your people in and clear a path for the Argentus."

8178, "Aye aye, sir. Let's blow this bird, she's pissed me off one too many times."

8179, "Command, I'm getting a bad feeling about this. We're getting some subspace distortion here... she may be closer to activating the portal than we realized."

8180, "Are you sure, Cypher?"

8181, "Very sure, it's now a full blown surge. The gate will be arriving at any moment! Get the Argentus ready, we may have to do this hot! Alpha, get on those beams!"

8182, "That's it Command, the gate is arriving any second now. Tell the Argentus it's now or never."

8183, "Affirmative, Cypher. Alpha, do whatever you have to to eliminate those beams immediately!"

8184, "Whoah... Command, the Knossos has arrived. I'm reading a new corvette and two cruisers. She's starting to stabilize. "

8185, "It's going to be a lot worse if you don't take down those beams, Alpha. The Argentus is on its way, do it NOW!"

8186, "Argentus is in, Command. This is it, we're making our final run."

8187, "Godspeed Argentus, we will remember you."

8188, "Acknowledged. GTCv Argentus, signing off."

8189, "Alpha, get on those beams! The Argentus won't make impact without your help!"

8190, "That's one beam cannon down, two to go. "

8191, "Two down! We've almost got it."

8192, "YEAH! That's it! Command! We did it! The beams are down, repeat the beams are down! Argentus has a free path now!"

8193, "All remaining pilots, get clear of the blast!"

8194, "Yeeeeeeehaw! Take that you big ugly bastard! The Nyarlathotep has been destroyed, mission is successful! Repeat, the Nyarlathotep is an expanding cloud! Mission is successful!"

8195, "My God, what an explosion! "

8196, "Congratulations, everyone. We barely made that one. You will all receive a commendation for this one."

8197, "We damn well better, and I will duct tape it to my cockpit."

8198, "Understood, Mackie, see you back home. Return to base."

8199, "The Argentus is taking damage, pilot, at this rate, she will not make impact!"

8200, "The Argentus is losing her hull integrity. Alpha, you're running out of time!"

8201, "Dear God, no... The Argentus didn't make it... It was our last hope..."

8202, "What does this mean?"

8203, "It means unbuckle your belt, lean over and kiss your ass goodbye, kid. The Nyarlathotep is powering up her jump drive. It was nice knowing all of you, but I suspect we're all going to be dead in a few seconds."

8204, "Oh my God... Oh my God... We're done for..."
