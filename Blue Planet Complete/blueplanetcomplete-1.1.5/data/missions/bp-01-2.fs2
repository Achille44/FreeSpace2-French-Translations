We are as mystified by the fate of the Earth as you are, pilots. We came here expecting a joyful reunion with our ancestral home, but instead we find death and destruction. This has been a bitter pill for us to swallow. Orestes Control will transfer our findings to GTVA Command and await further orders. In the meantime,  you are dismissed. Do not discuss your findings with anyone until the Admiral decides to release this information.

Counselling services are available should any of you require them, pilots.", 6211)
