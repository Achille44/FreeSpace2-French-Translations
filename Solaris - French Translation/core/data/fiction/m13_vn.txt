MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Okay everyone. Big things are going down and I need to make sure everyone's on the same page." 5870 "13a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "As I've said before this region's been descending into a shitshow for a while, but this is the worst it's been." 5871 "13a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Word around the trade cartels is that there's worsening unrest with industrial workers all around Sulsia. Something's got the roughnecks riled enough to drop tools. " 5872 "13a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "The Sulsian government's deployed the Navy to clamp down on trouble spots, but the unrest is escalating all around Sulsian space. They're spread thin trying to cover everywhere at once." 5873 "13a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "We're going to be spoilt for choice with security contracts, but if the situation gets too messy I'm bailing us out of Sulsia." 5874 "13a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "I'll never choose a job that forces us to do terrible things to innocent people. However anyone who doesn't feel like they can continue here is free to leave." 5875 "13a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Everyone on this ship is a volunteer, and I'll support whatever decision you make." 5876 "13a-07"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "We're headed to Korra Station, a silicon refinery in orbit of Rubedo." 5878 "13a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Twelve hours ago the refinery workers staged a coup and stormed the station's CnC." 5879 "13a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Thankfully no one was killed, but the facility is now in lockdown and all silicon refining has halted." 5880 "13a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "The workers have pledged solidarity to the Malika People's Militia, but the group hasn't claimed responsibility." 5881 "13a-12"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "The mining corporation Energence Industries has contracted a troop transport to assault and take back the station. Our job is to provide escort and eliminate all threats." 5882 "13a-13"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Two missile corvettes have taken up sentry positions near the station." 5883 "13a-14"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "They're essentially converted transports and shouldn't pose much of a threat to the Hoshikuzu. However they'll need to be dealt with before the marines can start their assault." 5884 "13a-15"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Before the assault can commence the station reactor needs to be disabled. This will cut power to the station and shut off the gravity generator." 5885 "13a-16"

MOVE player x=30 time=1.0
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Once in position, detach the mine and move out of the area. The mine has a thirty second timer before sending out a powerful pulse to disable the station's reactor." 5888 "13a-19"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Once the reactor is down, the Pollux Arrow will begin her assault and breach the station." 5889 "13a-20"
