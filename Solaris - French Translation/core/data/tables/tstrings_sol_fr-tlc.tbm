2479, "(fr)Great Powers"

2480, "(fr)The Miranda Accord of 2236 was signed into effect amongst the ashes of the Great War. The war was remarkable in the excesses of the tactics and weapons used, harkening back to the unrestrained industrial warfare of centuries ago. Unrestricted nuclear orbital bombardment had left several planets ecologically devastated, including Earth. By the time of ceasefire, billions of souls had perished. Humanity would not survive another such war.

A conference attended by representatives of every sovereign star nation set into motion a solemn, binding vow - never again will such destruction visit humanity's homes among the stars.

In addition to finalising the terms of armistice, a major tenet of the treaty was drafted to prevent a repeat of this tragedy by restricting the storage and deployment of spaceborne nuclear weapons to capital ships. Further treaty restrictions to nuclear proliferation limited capital ships to the three recognised Great Powers: the Atlantean Federation, Sinarus Combine and Alban Commonwealth. If any nation violated these restrictions, an automatic declaration of war by the three Great Powers would be enacted to enforce the treaty."

2481, "(fr)     Atlantean Federation"

2482, "(fr)'Liberty. Independence. Justice.'

The Atlantean Federation is a Great Power.

The Federation came into being as a military alliance of nation states to provide mutual defense against the authoritarian Combine. Mindful of the threat the monolithic Sol government represented, member states of the Atlantean Federation swiftly passed a constitution guaranteeing the political freedoms and autonomy of its systems.

A mosaic of varying cultures and political beliefs, the Federation covers a vast territory that includes several resource-rich systems. These critical resources helped support a massive wartime armament investment during the Great War. The fledgling alliance came out of the conflict with significant territorial and economic gains, overtaking every other rival to become the pre-eminent power in Terran space. However, the Federation strains under the tension of balancing member systems economic and political autonomy with the need for a centralised government to efficiently manage an increasingly hungry military budget.

The Federation has the largest military by tonnage of the Terran powers. A significant military industrial complex powers the Federation economy."

2483, "(fr)     Sinarus Combine"

2484, "(fr)'One people. One future.'

The Sinarus Combine is a Terran Great Power.

The Sinarus Combine rose from the ashes of the Sol Combine, the powerful administrative hub of Terran space. Economic and ecological collapse at the end of the Great War led to the replacement of Sol's government with a new capital in the Sinarus system. For the first time in human history, Earth had lost her place at the zenith of Terran administration and culture.

The following years were dark times for Combine citizens. The Sinarus government inherited a small but densely populated territory dependent on imports from outlying systems - systems now under Federation control. The loss of Earth's infrastructure and much of her population had also shattered the once-proud nation. The pragmatic but totalitarian ruling government took drastic action - entire swathes of the population were mobilised into rebuilding the economy. Power was concentrated at the upper echelons of the single-party government with severely curtailed political and social freedoms for its citizens. The nation's citizenry committed itself to this gargantuan task, firm in the belief that this was a necessary sacrifice to ensure a future for generations to come.

As a result, Combine leadership expects absolute loyalty to the state, including compulsory military service and working in a chosen area of a socially useful occupation. In return, Combine citizens have the right to comprehensive state welfare, housing and education.

As the economy recovered, the Sinarus Combine star fleet benefited from an extensive modernisation program. Heavily-armed warships are designed with less specialised roles than Federation equivalents with an emphasis on flexibility of movement and independent operations."

2485, "(fr)     Alban Commonwealth"

2486, "(fr)'For Crown and Country.'

The Alban Commonwealth is one of the Great Powers.

Fortune and foresight secured Commonwealth power. The capital system of Alba is the nexus of a densely populated hyperspace network, with extensive trading lanes established rapidly after the system was colonised. The Commonwealth's economy almost exclusively relies on trade, with Alban corporations maintaining some of the largest merchant navies in the galaxy.

During the final stages of the Great War, the Commonwealth took advantage of a unique opportunity to offer its services at mediation. In a diplomatic triumph, the Commonwealth arbitrated terms that satisfied both the Federation's territorial demands and the Combine's need to save face to its citizens. In 2236, the Alban Commonwealth chaired a conference attended by representatives from every independent star nation to draft the Miranda Accord. The prestige secured the recognition of the Commonwealth as a Great Power. Though not the military or industrial equal of the Federation or Combine, the Commonwealth still commands substantial economic and cultural power.

The Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the youthful Edward Wynson, a perspicacious and well-loved sovereign. Rumours circulate regarding House Wynson's ability to read and influence people, a trait shared by each generation of Wynson monarchs. This ability has taken on an almost mystical status from various embellishments over time.

Commonwealth military strengths lie in research and development, personnel training and naval intelligence. His Majesty's Navy is the smallest of the three Great Powers but emphasis on these strengths goes some way to offset the disadvantage in tonnage."

2487, "(fr)Middle Powers"

2488, "(fr)The central powers of the Combine and Federation dominate the heavily populated first colonies of humankind. Out in the anti-Spinward peripheries of the Orion arm, however, smaller powers jostle amongst each other for advantage. The rising power of the Alban Commonwealth acts as a tempering force, but the newly minted Great Power lacks the monolithic influence of the two premier powers in Terran space, and the primacy of its conventional military remains fragile."

2489, "(fr)     Republique Jacobine"

2490, "(fr)The Republique Jacobine is a Terran Middle Power.

An authoritarian parliamentary government born out of the rapid and tumultous colonisation throughout the Cygnus Reaches, a combination of shrewd economic management and military successes consolidated Jacobine power in the region. The Republique is an ambitious rising power convinced of it's place among the stars.

Decades of tensions with the Alban Commonwealth ended with the Pour Toujours Entente, signed in 2336 shortly after the nuclear destruction of Earth. This marked the beginning of forty years of scientific, military and economic cooperation between the two nations. Recent years have seen a concerted effort by the Jacobine and Alban Parliaments to create a bloc separate to the Sinarus and Atlantean behemoths. 

The La Marine is one of the most capable spacefaring navies in Terran space, operating a modern fleet of advanced warships. Recent territorial expansions and establishment of distant naval bases has increased the operational requirements of the Republican Navy."

2491, "(fr)     Greater Yamatan Union"

2492, "(fr)The Greater Yamatan Union ranks among the Middle Powers.

The vast regions of the Cygnan Wastelands belong to those strong enough to claim them. Militant and isolationist, the Yamatan people have embraced a mechanistic, materialistic worldview. The Yamatan Union routinely apply bioprosthetic enhancement technology to its citizens, with labourers and soldiers receiving particularly drastic augmentations. The psychological unease from outsiders regarding the extent of these modifications as well as condemnation over the sometimes brutal regimentation of Yamatan citizens has placed the Union at odds with other Cygnus Region nations. The Yamatan Union is particularly hostile towards the Alban Commonwealth, who it sees as undermining Union expansion and influence.

The Greater Yamatan Navy is the primary tool for advancing national interests in a nation with ambitions towards Great Power status with a conventional space military that rivals the Alban Commonwealth."

2493, "(fr)Non-State Actors"

2494, "(fr)Though hyperspace lanes provide natural points of interest and natural roads for expansion, the huge distances involved provide challenges for national governments to maintain the infrastructure required for effective and cohesive running of a state. 

When weaker nations are unable to provide security or maintain the loyalty of their populations, non-state armed groups such as citizen militias, criminal organisations and warlords develop as alternatives to governance by the state. These groups vary widely in capability and goals, but all contribute to the challenges faced by governing states in the 23rd century."

2495, "(fr)     Malika People's Militia"

2496, "(fr)The Malika People's Militia is officially classified as a Violent Non-State Actor.

The Fringe is a vast, sparsely populated region of space at the rimward edge of the Orion Arm, notable for an abundance of mineral resources. The Sulsian Hegemony had an iron grip on the major population centres, but corrupt bureaucracy and underdeveloped infrastructure allowed various militia groups in the region to flourish. Chief among these groups was the Malika People's Militia.

The Militia had an unassuming beginning after an armed rebellion on the asteroid mining hub Jotram Station in 2273. Already a precarious situation due to unsafe working conditions with minimal pay, the powder keg exploded when an engineering failure led to a loss of critical supplies and the deaths of several workers. Mercenary turned corsair Andri Gadaria diverted several captured supply ships to Jotram with the intention of winning over the worker population and create a new base of support. Gadaria's ruthlessness and charisma ensured his message of worker liberation propagated widely across Sulsia, making him a popular figure amongst indentured labourers.

The Malika People's Militia is a disparate coalition of paramilitary organisations, warbands and armed worker groups across Fringe space, whose armed forces are rapidly organising into a cohesive, coordinated institution. Supplied with powerful modern weapons by a mysterious benefactor, the Militia Navy has been able to challenge the Sulsian Hegemony for control of the resource-rich Fringe."

2497, "(fr)     Children of Renewal"

2498, "(fr)The frontiers of Terran Space are a region of intense religious activity. The absence of established institutions and an overwhelmingly practical worldview in a hardscrabble existence divested traditional religious organisations of authority. Ad-hoc spirituality took hold in the region, democratising religion and legitimised individual spiritual expression. Hardship and strong community ties formed the basis of this egalitarian landscape.

In the fertile ground of the Fringe, the Children of Renewal found a people primed to receive their message. The Renewal emphasis on the individual ability of a person to effect his or her own salvation resonated greatly. The message of charity and emphasis on personal development was especially popular with wealthy investors in the Federation, which provided finance for several major projects for expansion in the Fringe.

The Children of Renewal believe in salvation through charity and have several outreach programs throughout the Fringe. Flotillas of repair ships and supply transports crewed by volunteers are deployed to areas of need, all in the name of the Lord. A core belief of the Renewal is that the most important work is often the most difficult, which means Renewal ships are often found in disaster zones and contested regions thought too dangeorus for other organisations to operate."

2499, "(fr)Hyperspace"

2500, "(fr)In the late 22nd century, a revolution in space travel was accomplished. An alternative dimension of space-time, hyperspace was first postulated in wormhole theory. By tunneling between two points in 3-dimensional space, a vessel could practically achieve faster-than-light travel without the deterministic complications of actual FTL travel. The first hyperspace drives were cumbersome devices employing vast amounts of energy to fold two points in space and establish a hyperspace tunnel between them.

A second revolution came about through the detection of 'highways' connecting various points in real-space. Not only was the energy requirement far lower to 'enter' and 'exit' hyperspace at these points, travel time was significantly shorter than by the previous method of hyperspace travel. With the discovery of these hyperspace lanes, Terran colonisation of the Orion Arm accelerated at an exponential level. Whilst it is universally accepted that the presence of these lanes has been a boon to our species, the origin of these lanes remains a mystery. Are these lanes a natural byproduct of the hyperspace phenomenon, or were they artificially constructed by technology far in advance of ours?"

You two handled those hostile wings well. Command believes these are advance scout parties of the main invasion force. Expect heavier enemy presence over the next few days as we engage the bulk of the incursion.

Hopefully today's patrol marks the first of many operations alongside the Elam Navy.

We're to stay in Durius. Rear Admiral Akrami has authorised a reconnaissance in force to flush out and engage other Qahtadnan assets.

2763, "(fr)Survival"

2764, "(fr)Welcome back Lieutenant Ross. You performed your mission to expectation. Unfortunately it didn't have the outcome we desired.

Federation Defense Intelligence were studying an alien relic. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Combine NavInt somehow found out about Federation experiments and used overwhelming military force to kick FDI out of Mira and steal their research data. The Combine superweapon at Morik was designed using alien technology. That ship we encountered at the artifact must have been Solaris given form.

Ideally we would have wanted to gain control of the artifact. The botched attempt by the Combine to destroy the artifact instead created an artificial hyperspace junction. The artifact is out of our reach - for now.

This is where we part ways. You're to transfer to the Athena effective immediately. Captain Fisher is aware and will make the necessary arrangements. She'll drop you off at the Akrotiri system, from there you can make your way back home. I've made the necessary amendments to your service record. You'll have a cover story to explain your absence to the relevant authorities regarding your Federation exchange tour. I'd lay low for the next few weeks just to be safe.

Lieutenant McKearney is accompanying you back home. We have no more need of her services.

Everything you've learned in the past 24 hours is classified Top Secret. We're dealing with advanced nonhuman technology that is beyond anything that our species has encountered or created. No one knows what this technology is fully capable of, but it won't stay secret for long. Before word gets out, we need get as much advantage as we can.

This artifact may be the factor that escalates this conflict beyond the Federation and Combine. This goes beyond old grudges, resources and national pride. The stakes have become too high. Everyone's now fighting for survival."

2879, "(fr)Hi Stuart.

I'm happy with your flying ability. To be honest I'm just glad you're not one of those hacks hiding their lack of flight experience to get a job. The way you disabled those mines and the freighter means you're already light years ahead. I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Ferris is happy enough with how things turned out. Sulsian military security has identified the Stargazer freighter as the Samoyed. She's been implicated in 'salvage runs' throughout Sulsian space as well as laying mines for drone sabotage. I hear her crew's keeping tight-lipped. Let's see how long they can stay quiet.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. I hope this is the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

2880, "(fr)Hi Stuart.

I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Station master Ferris is furious that we lost that Stargazer freighter. We don't know who set the mines there nor who is responsible for the salvage operations. She's threatened to withhold our payment. I had to remind her that technically our mission was to clear the salvage field and find out what happened to her drones. She's grudgingly paid our completion fee, but I don't think she'll be offering us any more contracts at Overton.

I've used the funds to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. Things can only go up from here, so let's stay positive okay? Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

2881, "(fr)Mission successful.

Warship astrogation systems tend to be less protected than engine subsystems, so if the objective is to prevent a departure it may be quicker to destroy the astrogation subsystem than disabling the engines.

Sometimes the weapons available do not allow for efficient subsystem destruction. In this case destruction of the target becomes the only option."

3208, "(fr)See if you can find more. We can't leave any explosives floating around."

3219, "(fr)This doesn't make sense. No one's been through the area for weeks. Who set those mines?"

3220, "(fr)I'll head back to Overton. They better hike up our hazard pay, those mines were serious business."

3221, "(fr)One second Ross. There's faint sensor contacts from the far side of the field. You should check them out."

3222, "(fr)Lau, you're not going to believe this."

3223, "(fr)That's one of the station's salvage drones! And what the hell is that Stargazer doing?"

3226, "(fr)That Stargazer is twenty seconds from spooling her impellers. Take out her astrogation ssytems before she jumps!"

3227, "(fr)Ok. She's not going anywhere. I'm calling in a security detachment to apprehend her."

3228, "(fr)What the hell are you doing? This is unacceptable! You've lost our best chance of finding out who did this."

3229, "(fr)I'm sorry Ferris. There wasn't anything else we could have done."

3234, "(fr)You didn't tell me this fighter moves like a sleepy hog Lau."

3235, "(fr)Don't be so rude. It's not a fighter, it's a missile gunship. It's not supposed to dogfight."

3236, "(fr)What made you decide to add missile pods? No one uses them nowadays, they're so easy to counter."

3237, "(fr)Missiles can still be useful out here in the fringe. There's a lot of obsolete old junkers out here, and not all of them use countermeasures."

3238, "(fr)Sorry, Lau. I didn't mean to be rude. I'm guessing the missile weapons systems are adding to the gunship's weight."

3239, "(fr)Of course they are. I tried to get the missile pods as light as they could, but it's a complex system. You need a lot of machinery."

3240, "(fr)It's a far cry from your shiny Commonwealth Ross. There's no gloss here. Everyone's doing what they can to survive."

3241, "(fr)Do you mind holding around the area for a while? Sulsian security tends to be...tardy and there's no one else around to help."

3242, "(fr)Depends. Do I get an overtime bonus?"

3243, "(fr)You're a funny guy Ross. Of course not."

Compass Rose arrived safely at her destination under the engine power of the Outreach. The executives at Trinity Holdings are delighted with the outcome and have thanked us for recovering the cargo. I hear the injured crew members are all doing okay.

In fact, I hear that Shafer has been fined a hefty amount and his master's license suspended. It seems the Sulsian Merchant Safety Authority wasn't impressed with the way he endangered his ship with that faulty impeller, citing several safety regulations that he breached. Nice to see a regulations agency with some teeth out here. Anywhere else, he'd have gotten away with it."

3252, "(fr)Your defense of the Hoshikuzu was outstanding. Those Malikan raiders were serious about taking us out, but we showed them we were more than up to the task. How did the militia group get their hands on top of the line military ordnance?

I'm not too familiar with the Malika People's Militia. All I know is they're a fringe group in conflict with the Sulsian Hegemony, and the closest thing they have to a leader is an ex-soldier called Andri Gadaria. His stated goals are the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination' whatever that means. Up until now they've been running mostly guerilla operations, and despite the Sulsian military's shortcomings, the group have been able to be contained. I've submitted a report of our encounter to the Sulsian Navy. Their threat assessment of the local militia groups needs updating.

I'm glad both of you are here with us. You keep performing the way you did, I think we'll do good out here."

3253, "(fr)We barely made it out of there alive. The Hoshikuzu took heavy damage from the Malikan raiders' weapons. Our payment managed to cover repairs, but it was a close one out there. How did the militia group get their hands on top of the line military ordnance?

Attacks by the resurgent Malika People's Militia continue to escalate, with the loss of the Trinity Holdings freighter Compass Rose after suffering engine failure. Trinity Holdings also reports that a contracted security ship sent to assist the stricken freighter was lost to militia forces.

Profits along the Multnomah trade route continue to fall, and there signs that major shipping corporations are making preparations to abandon the area. If confirmed, this is expected to have a major impact on the already faltering Sulsian economy."

The Malikans were definitely behind the Korra mutiny. In fact, it's starting to look like they've been behind most of the uprisings in Sulsia.

This is a worrying escalation. Those transports were carrying troops to secure their hold on Korra, which means that they aren't just aiming to disrupt Sulsian operations. They plan to occupy assets and territory.

If I didn't know better, I'd say that Andri Gadaria is going beyond his goals of worker liberation. He's building an army.

Energence Industries has paid a bonus to the Hoshikuzu's crew for taking care of the Malikan reinforcements and keeping Navo's men safe. I'm using the extra credits to source some new equipment for the gunships. I'll get Kaur to go through the new cannons with you later."

The Albans are on their way home. The Hoshikuzu has also left the system with the Nassau. Master Badami reports the Hopewell's tow is still secure.

News reports aren't good. Malikan attack ships have swept through the system wiping out any Sulsian resistance they encounter. Kotus Anchorage has been occupied. The entire system is in lockdown.

The newsfeeds are buzzing with this development and speculating what other governments are going to do. The Albans have already shown that they can't protect their own citizens outside of Commonwealth borders. I'm not holding my breath that they'll do anything, they were the ones that helped bring about this mess by winding back all of their trade lane patrols. The Federation and Combine are too busy at each others' throats to care about what's going on here. No one else has a stake in what goes on in Sulsia.

I'm going to need a moment to process what just happened. Kendra and her crew are still held in remand under Colonel Navo and his soldiers. She was responsible for the deaths of dozens of Alban civilians when her ship destroyed the Elgin. By rights I should give her to the Commonwealth to answer for her crimes. I may end up doing that...but I need to talk to her first.

I've put us on a course to Vicare Station. The Pollux Arrow, Hopewell and the Nassau will join us for repairs and resupply.

We'll have a few days to rest up and get our collective heads together."

3645, "(fr)Your ship is faster than they are Katherine. You should leave them and save yourself. My employer only wants the Albans dead, not you."

3646, "(fr)Transports, how much time until you can make another jump?"

3647, "(fr)We need at least ten minutes. We're trying to make best speed with our fusion drives and can't divert any more power to the impeller."

3648, "(fr)I see. We don't have any other options, do we?"

3649, "(fr)Lau I hope you realise that destroyer's gaining on us. She's nearly in PDC range."

3650, "(fr)Lau, you're not seriously considering abandoning these civilians?"

3651, "(fr)My cousin's the monster, not me Ross."

3652, "(fr)Transports, continue your course. I'm breaking the Hoshikuzu off to engage the Nassau. This is the only way we'll get out of this."

3653, "(fr)You have no idea how long I've waited for this Katherine. A chance to finally prove that I was better than you."

3654, "(fr)You may have ruined my family, but I'll be the one who ruined you in the end."

3657, "(fr)We'll never be able to outrun the Nassau. I'm going to occupy Kendra while the transports warm up their drives."

3658, "(fr)Are you crazy? That ship is twice your size Lau!"

3659, "(fr)Don't worry about me Ross! I know my cousin. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve."

3660, "(fr)This isn't going to save your charges Katherine. I'll just cripple your ship and then destroy the transports anyway."

3675, "(fr)Kendra. It's over. Stand down and save your crew. I can call for assistance to help your injured."

3676, "(fr)Typical self-righteous bitch. Spare me the false altruism. You just want to get to me and gloat."

3677, "(fr) Fine, you've got me. My crew are laying down arms."

3678, "(fr)Captain Lau, it's good to see you. We were sent to assist with the Commonwealth evacuation once word got out about the Elgin."

3679, "(fr)Good to see you too Navo. The Albans are safe now, but we could still use your help. Stand by to receive passengers from two short-ranged transports."

3680, "(fr)Oh my god Lau, what the hell is going on between you two?"

3681, "(fr)We're also going to need help with this destroyer. I don't suppose you know any auxiliary ships available on short notice?"

3682, "(fr)As it so happens, the master of the Hopewell owes me a favour. I'll give him a call. I guess you owe me one too."

3683, "(fr)Lau here. She's getting torn up bad. We're losing power."

3684, "(fr)I'll be damned Lau. You managed to pull it off."

3685, "(fr)I told you Ross. Though to be honest I probably couldn't have done it without you and Meiks. So thank you."

3690, "(fr)That was a total disaster. How could this have happened?

This was supposed to be a simple escort mission in a remote location away from hostile territory. Not only did the Malikans know exactly where to find us, they went out of their way to hunt us down. To add to the disaster, the Pillar of Fire has been commandeered and we barely got away with her crew.

Reverend Lightowler's understandably distraught. I think he's more upset with the setback to the Promised Land journey than the loss of the survey ship. He's assured me that he doesn't blame us for what happened. He plans to take the surviving crew and rejoin the main Renewal congregation. We've been invited to join him.

I have no idea what technology the Malikans were using to mess up our astrogation calculations. At this point it shouldn't surprise me that a cobbled together armada of militia ships should somehow have technology that not even Great Powers have access to. Thankfully Erikson was able to isolate the source of the field. I owe her a drink at Vicare's rec room.

We're running out of luck and out of hiding places. I'm in contact with Navo and Master Badami of the Hopewell. I have a proposition to pool our resources and work together. It's getting to the stage where it's too dangerous for us to work alone."

3743, "(fr)Hoshikuzu, something's wrong with our astrogation systems. We can't plot a reliable course out of the Veil. Can you confirm?"

3753, "(fr)I think you're right. Someone led the Malikans here. Probably the same person who sabotaged the Pillar's engines."

3754, "(fr)Lau, I've found the source of the gravity anomalies. That Malikan science ship is sending out gravity pulses. They're confusing our astrogation plotters."

3755, "(fr)Good work Erikson. Ross, that's your target. Assault the Vehemence and try to disrupt that gravity generator."

3756, "(fr)Captain Lau, this is Lightowler. My crew are in the auxiliary transports. We're commencing detachment from the Pillar."

I thought it would be the Malikans. I was hoping to take a few weeks out at Vicare, maybe help with the evacuation effort and run a few convoy escorts. Turns out there was an even bigger war out there and it's now arrived here.

Long range sensors are picking up Combine ships moving towards Sulsian space and more Federation ships have arrived at Vicare Station. Battlecruisers, frigates and cruisers, it's going to get crowded here very soon and the refugees are going to get caught right in the middle.

Reverend Lightowler's preparing the Renewal and refugee ships to leave Vicare. I've let him know my intentions of doing the same. Once all the refugees are off Vicare Station and onto the transports, we leave."

3819, "(fr)Lau. I'm trying to tell you something here. This isn't easy for me."

3820, "(fr)As one of his closest friends, I can confirm. This is a rare moment Lau."

3821, "(fr)I'm sorry. I wasn't laughing at you Ross. To be honest I'm honoured you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Have you told anyone else your story?"

3822, "(fr)Not really. There was...a friend of mine who did ask. I'm afraid I wasn't a very good friend to her."

3823, "(fr)It's nice to have actual firepower for once. Jackhammers are still crap, but better than nothing I guess."

3824, "(fr)I think joining up with the Hopewell and Navo was the best idea Lau's ever had."

3825, "(fr)You're welcome guys. It's a crazy universe out there and we need to take care of each other."

3826, "(fr)I grew up in a family of physicians Lau. It was the most restrictive home environment you can imagine."

3827, "(fr)Have you scheduled any more weapons practice for us?"

3828, "(fr)That's it for now. We should log this with the Sulsian garrison, in case they come up with jobs for us later."

3829, "(fr)I can register our group as qualified for anti-capship strikes. We'll be in high demand after this."

3830, "(fr)You take the lead Ross. Head over to the garrison HQ and we'll go from there."

3831, "(fr)Well maybe you should tell her too, the next time you see her. I'm also happy to hear the rest of your story, when you were ready."

3832, "(fr)Uh oh. This looks like trouble."

3833, "(fr)This is Captain Oberthur on the Thanatos, Federation Second Fleet. We are on a mission to maintain security at Vicare Station. Prepare to receive our vessel."

3834, "(fr)This is Commander Lutzhorn, Sulsian garrison. This is an illegal trespass. Our government has not authorised the deployment of Atlantean ships in our space."

3835, "(fr)This is not negotiable Commander. There's too much at stake here. The Sinarus Combine must not gain a foothold in this sector."

3836, "(fr)All ships are warned to maintain distance from the Thanatos, or we will consider you to have hostile intent."

3837, "(fr)Ross, this looks bad. Get back to the Hopewell immediately. Keep away from that Atlantean warship."

3838, "(fr)Be advised our government has no wish to infringe on the sovereignty of this station. We seek only to dissuade the Sinarus government from occupying this territory."

3839, "(fr)This is an invasion of Sulsian space! Our government will hear of this Captain. You won't get away with this."

3840, "(fr)Your government will thank us later when Vicare remains under Sulsian control. The Combine will not be as accommodating when they arrive Commander Lutzhorn. "

3841, "(fr)Ross, get the hell away from that battlecruiser! I'm not going down because of this."

3842, "(fr)Ross! Get back to the Hopewell!"

3843, "(fr)Though I don't really go out that much. I don't take to the high-g cocktail as well as other pilots do."

3844, "(fr)Are you going to be ok Lau?"

3849, "(fr)All right Meiks, Ross. We need to talk.

Today is giving me the worst headache. My two contract pilots turn out to be Alban navy officers. I don't know what to do with this information.

What you did out there today Ross was...incredible. I don't think we could have made it without you. You proved your initiative and leadership ability when you took command of the fighter wings.

That being said, this complicates things. Not only am I your employer, while you remain a member of the Hoshi's crew I'm also your captain. I was put in command of the fighter group because the Hopewell's pilots knew who I was and were willing to follow my orders. They don't know you Ross, I had to urge them to follow your orders over private comms. This really isn't good enough. This isn't the military but hierarchy still means something in this unit. We need to come up with a better way to establish who's in command. 

Now that I know you've got military command experience Ross I'm more comfortable to give you more autonomy. I just wish you'd told me sooner, not when we're under attack by a Combine rear admiral."

3850, "(fr)Rear admirals. Speaking of which. The Combine have occupied Vicare station. The entire system is in lockdown.

And the whole thing only got a passing mention in the news. No story of Kakotchka attacking civilians, no mention of how an entire system got annexed. Just a statement from the Combine how they're there to 'stabilise the growing regional unrest'. Kakotchka should be put to court for war crimes, but like that's ever going to happen. Everyone's too caught up in the new Great War, no one cares what happens out in the fringe.

3900, "(fr)They destroyed a Federation battlecruiser in seconds Meiks! They're going to roll over us like nothing!"

3901, "(fr)The Combine aren't like the Malikans, Lau. They have to play by the rules, which means not firing on civilians."

3903, "(fr)Choralist, bring maximum interception fire against that missile swarm. All stations, brace for missile impact!"

3905, "(fr)Choralist, form up! Move to bearing 45 by 355."

3918, "(fr)Damn it Meiks!"

3919, "(fr)Ross? Since when were you a Commonwealth officer?"

3920, "(fr)Lau, I need command of the fighter wings if we're getting out of this. This is going to get rough."

3921, "(fr)You want command of the fighters? Uh, sure. If you know what you're doing."

3922, "(fr)All right. Looks like the Combine have sent their LACs in to attack. Standard Combine battle doctrine."

3923, "(fr)These are your orders. Gunships and bombers attack the LACs. Warden fighters keep the Combine escorts busy."

3924, "(fr)Long live the King!"

3925, "(fr)Thank you Lau. I won't let you down."

3926, "(fr)Combine LACs are down!"

3927, "(fr)That's the fighters taken care of."

3928, "(fr)Strikecraft threat is no more. Those were light carriers, that'll be their entire complement gone."

3929, "(fr)We need to take out that battlecruiser quick. Her guns'll make short work of the Hoshi and Nassau."

3930, "(fr)Remember what I taught you Ross! Take out their weapons systems, they'll lose fire control."

3931, "(fr)Ross, I don't understand. Why haven't those cruisers fired another missile barrage?"

3932, "(fr)I don't know Lau. Maybe they're trying to avoid collateral damage?"

3933, "(fr)Lau, Ross. Those cruisers are arsenal ships. They have ammunition for two salvoes only. They're no longer a threat."

3934, "(fr)What? How could you know that Erikson? No one's seen these cruisers before."

3935, "(fr)I have Lau."

3936, "(fr)Main turrets are down. We've bought some time for our ships."

3937, "(fr)We've got a fix on the Zaragoza. Kai silos are armed and ready for launch."

3938, "(fr)Captain Lau, we're detecting an impeller spool on that battlecruiser. "

3939, "(fr)I don't believe it! We've driven off the Zaragoza."

3940, "(fr)Ross, it's working! The Zaragoza is peeling off!"

3941, "(fr)Combine reinforcements have jumped in! A wolfpack of destroyers led by a light cruiser."

3942, "(fr)Lau, we're steadily losing control of the tactical situation."

3943, "(fr)Like we ever had control in the first place."

3944, "(fr)This isn't going to work. The transports still need a few minutes of spool. I'm preparing the Nassau to assault the Zaragoza."

3945, "(fr)Don't be crazy Navo. You'll never survive against the Zaragoza alone. I'm bringing Hoshikuzu in to help."

3946, "(fr)We need to take out the Combine PDCs so that our ASMs have a clear run to that battlecruiser. All fighters watch for my target calls."

3947, "(fr)Nassau, Hoshikuzu. Our ships have cleared minimum safe distance. We're commencing impeller spool for hyperspace jump."

3948, "(fr)The battlecruiser is impeding our jump vector. We still need to clear that warship's vicinity."

3949, "(fr)Civilian transports are away! We've done it Lau."

3950, "(fr)Oh thank god. Erikson, Navo, get your ships out. All fighters, move to the Hopewell. It's time to leave."

3951, "(fr)Lau, the Hoshikuzu is taking a beating."

3952, "(fr)Erikson, be careful! Don't break my ship."

3953, "(fr)Ugh, Erikson! Be careful!"

3954, "(fr)Hey Lau. Quien es este idiota que cree que puede darnos ordenes?"

3955, "(fr)Follow his orders Enrique. Es un amigo y conf�o en el."

3956, "(fr)Ross, that battlecruiser is getting pretty close."

3957, "(fr)Erikson, we need to have to talk later."

3958, "(fr)This is a bloody shambles. Why didn't the Atlanteans bring any carriers? How did the bloody Combine get fighter superiority over the Federation?"

We can confirm the arrival of Covenant and her attending ships at the rendezvous. All ships are accounted for, with no casualties reported.

Unfortunately the efforts of Navo's marines to apprehend the crew were unsuccessful. The freighter crew were clearly on a suicide mission and had contingencies in place in the event of capture. There was not enough left of their bodies for a clear identity verification. We have sent the remains for DNA matching.

We have compiled a report for Fleet Command regarding the events of today. I plan to especially highlight the contributions of Lieutenant Stuart Ross who was crucial to the neutralisation of the nuclear attack."

4003, "(fr)I don't know the specifics Lau. Fleet doesn't tell me anything. I get my news from CBN."

4004, "(fr)Sulsian convoy, this is HMS Aria of the Crown Navy. What is the status of the Alban diplomatic personnel?"

4005, "(fr)This is Corazon Hayburn. Alban citizens are on board the main Renewal transport ship. I am in talks with the ship's master to facilitate our transfer to the Rondeau."

4007, "(fr)Why are they only picking up Alban citizens? There's room for everyone on that auxiliary ship. They could save everyone."

4008, "(fr)Because they're Commonwealth citizens Lau. The Commonwealth doesn't have the resources to save everyone. Might as well ask that auxiliary ship to pick up every refugee in Covenant."

4009, "(fr)Don't worry Lau. The refugees will be ok."

4010, "(fr)Lau. There's been a development. Your cousin Kendra wants to speak to you."

4011, "(fr)What? Why? Get her on a secure channel, beam it to my comms."

4012, "(fr)What do you think that's all about?"

4013, "(fr)I've got a hunch it's related to that Combine admiral that attacked the refugee convoy. Kendra's got to be connected to her somehow."

4014, "(fr)That Kakotchka must have been pretty desperate. She was bloody damned close to crossing a big red line, attacking civilians like that."

4015, "(fr)Wouldn't surprise me if she was the same person who hired Kendra Lau to attack the Elgin and the other Commonwealth transports."

4016, "(fr)You think we're about to hear a confession from Kendra?"

4017, "(fr)Probably. There's a Commonwealth ship here ready to receive her. She's thinking she'll get off lightly if she spills her guts before we hand her over."

4018, "(fr)Interesting if it's true. Someone from ANI probably uncovered some big secret of Kakotchka's. No wonder she's panicking, locking down Sulsia."

4019, "(fr)If it turns out to be the Combine that's responsible for destroying Commonwealth transports, that's going to be taken as a declaration of war."

4020, "(fr)So you're saying the Commonwealth doesn't have the resources to  transport a few refugees? Your so-called $quoteGreat Power$quote?"

4021, "(fr)War's inevitable Meiks. Romanowska saw to that when she nuked Morik."

4022, "(fr)Sulsian fighters, this is Commander Cameron, HMS Aria. We have a situation that needs your cooperation."

4023, "(fr)This is Katherine Lau. We'll cooperate, but are currently employed by the Children of Renewal. You'll have to run it past them."

4024, "(fr)Reverend Frances on Covenant has nominated your wing specifically, Katherine Lau. "

4025, "(fr)Then I suppose we're at your service. What's the situation?"

4026, "(fr)Our sensors detected a heat spike on one of the freighters around Covenant. It may be a tritium leak from their fusion reactor but we need to confirm this and offer assistance if required."

4027, "(fr)If the ship has an unstable reactor, it could pose an explosive hazard to the surrounding ships in the convoy."

4028, "(fr)Have you tried contacting the freighter's master?"

4029, "(fr)Yes. All we're getting is an autogenerated message citing comms failure."

4030, "(fr)We're sending you the transponder of the freighter in question. We need an active scan of the cargo and the ship's comms subsystem to confirm her distress."

4031, "(fr)Ross, can you go? Meiks and I will stay with the Gogoltha in case we're needed."

4032, "(fr)Aria, Alfa 1 off Hopewell. Cargo painted. I see the tritium leak, but it's from the cargo box, not the ship's reactor."

4033, "(fr)Aria copies, Alfa 1. This is concerning. Scan the comms subsystem of the freighter."

4034, "(fr)Aria, Alfa 1. I've run a remote diagnostic on that freighter. Her transceiver is in full working condition."

4036, "(fr)We've got movement! The freighter's burning towards the Sulsian refugee convoy!"

4044, "(fr)This is transport Remembering Gogoltha. We have two thousand souls aboard. Please help us!"

4045, "(fr)The warhead has gone active! Reading a sustained nuclear chain reaction on the freighter."

4046, "(fr)Lau, get yourself and Meiks clear of the blast radius! Every ship needs to scatter now! "

4047, "(fr)We're not leaving these refugees to die!"

4048, "(fr)Oh my god! It's heading straight for the Gogoltha."

4049, "(fr)Katherine Lau. The freighter is closing in on the Gogoltha. You've done all you can. Get your ships clear."

4050, "(fr)I'm...sorry Reverend. I'm sorry your people weren't able to see their Promised Land."

4051, "(fr)We wouldn't have got this far without you, Katherine. We may be lost, but Covenant and her people still need you. Bring them to salvation, in our memory."

4052, "(fr)God damn it."

4053, "(fr)We're not giving up now. Not after coming so far."

4054, "(fr)The Lord teaches us that the most important roads are often the most difficult. This is not a failure Katherine Lau. It is a test for our people, one that we will overcome."

4055, "(fr)Sulsian convoy. Be advised we may have identified a bypass for the warhead's detonation trigger. Continue to make distance from the freighter. Alfa 1, we need further assistance."

4056, "(fr)Say again Aria? Have you found a way to deactivate the warhead?"

4057, "(fr)Your scan helped pinpoint the freighter's transmitting frequencies to the nuclear warhead. We may be able to repurpose the warhead's receiver."

4058, "(fr)If you scan the rest of the freighter's subsystems, we'll be able to pin down exactly how the warhead's detonation trigger is linked to the freighter's systems and bypass them altogether."

4059, "(fr)That'll do it. Tactical, bypass the trigger for the warhead's arming sequence. It won't stop a contact detonation but it's a start."

4060, "(fr)Helm, maintain a tight formation to the freighter. That bypass is on a tightrope. If we lose signal integrity at any time, we're done for."

4061, "(fr)We've bought some time. Alfa 1, take out the freighter's engines. Be careful, try not to damage the cargo."

4062, "(fr)Reverend Lightowler, you can rest easier now. The freighter's dead in space and the warhead detonation trigger has been disabled."

4063, "(fr)You did it Ross!"

4064, "(fr)Great work lad. Now what do we do with it?"

4065, "(fr)Navo, prepare the Pollux Arrow for a boarding mission. We should apprehend the crew for questioning."

The FNS Artemis was destroyed in the assault against Qahtadnan forces in a significant blow for the Federation military. Contact was lost with the assault carrier soon after embarking on the assault. No details have been released regarding the circumstances of her destruction.

Qahtadnan forces have occupied Durius after driving out the rest of Federation and Elam forces in the system. Talks are in place regarding terms of surrender by the Elam Republic."

4143, "(fr)Alban Intelligence just got a major boost Lieutenant. As expected, the convoy was a weapons shipment.

The freighter's electronic manifest originates from Brenner, the Combine system where she allegedly collected the mining equipment. Usually the station commander signs off the shipment before departure is authorised, but this particular convoy was signed off by Rear Admiral Kakotchka herself.  

ANI is collating the data against what we already know of Kakotchka and a case will be made at the International Court of Justice. Crown Command has already authorised the deployment of a battle squadron to Sulsia to contest Kakotchka's annexation of Vicare Station. Rear Admiral Cleghorn on HMS Formidable will arrive in Sulsia in a few days.

I've signed off on the payment transfer to Katherine Lau's account. Your group did well enough out there. In particular I've made note of your competence in my report to Command. Your performance was instrumental in our success today, and I'll make sure your superiors know.

I'm taking the Aria to Ladigue station for resupply and service before heading back to our mission at Covenant. This is where we part ways. 

However, there's one more thing. As you know the Arrowhead corvettes have field maintenance facilities for an attending fighter. I would not be averse to having a pilot like yourself as part of my crew when you decide to return to full pay. Think about it, Lieutenant."

We now know why Gadaria went to ground. He's built himself a damned capital ship, and it's armed with nuclear weapons. I don't know how the hell Bertini's going to stop him this time. This is beyond anything the Sulsians have.

The Sulsians are going to bring this to the International Court of Justice. This is a massive breach of the Miranda Accord. We all learned about it at school, it's the foundation for everything our society stands for. Gadaria has the power to bring Armageddon, and the Sinarus Combine gave him this power.

Admiral Bertini's released us from service. Jotram Station has been occupied by Sulsian troops and is now secure. The resources captured will help, but no one knows how long the Sulsians could hold the station if the Malikans try a recapture. Bertini's ships are heading back to Sulsia to prepare for Gadaria's inevitable assault.

I don't know what happened to Covenant. I don't know if Kakotchka and Gadaria got to Lightowler or if he was able to make it out. I guess we'll never know.

Anyway, I want to thank you and Meiks for everything you've done for us. For the Hoshikuzu, for the Nassau and Hopewell, for Sulsia.

4406, "(fr)All ships, form up around the Covenant. We need to concentrate our defensive fire. Angel Company, we will need your guns to aid our defense."

4407, "(fr)We will not comply, Aria. Angel Company has declared this contract void. We're spooling our impellers."

4408, "(fr)We appreciate your concern Commander Cameron, but we do not require assistance. I ask that all of your ships stand clear of the planetary gateway. This is for your safety, and the safety of your crews."

4409, "(fr)Commander, Malikan bombers have launched!"

4411, "(fr)All ships, get clear of that gateway!"

4412, "(fr)Enemy strike craft have terminated their attack runs! The bombers are coming to a stop."

4413, "(fr)Tactical, analysis! Did that energy discharge come from the artifact?"

4414, "(fr)Confirmed. That surge originated from the artifact. Detecting ongoing low level emissions from that location."

4415, "(fr)There's a problem with our navigation! We can't calculate a hyperspace exit vector from the system!"

4416, "(fr)Reverend Lightowler. Was this your handiwork?"

4417, "(fr)No, Katherine Lau. I am but the disciple for the Lord, and He has plans for His Chosen People."

4418, "(fr)Everyone on Covenant thanks you for helping us realise our dream. You should gather your forces and leave promptly. This is not a welcoming place for those who aren't the Lord's Chosen."

4419, "(fr)Confirmed. It's the same as when Gadaria attacked us in the Veil. There has to be an interdictor ship nearby."

4420, "(fr)No time for that now. Intercept those ASMs!"

4421, "(fr)We're going nowhere until that interdictor ship is destroyed. Can anyone get a lock on that signal?"

4422, "(fr)Already ahead of you, Lau. Lieutenant Ross, your target is highlighted. Combine pulse generator of unknown class. Bring it down."

4423, "(fr)We won't have time to take up position before those nuclear bombers reach Covenant!"

4424, "(fr)That's done it. The gravity pulses are weakening. Calculating an exit vector."

4426, "(fr)<intercepted> Because, Feroz, they promised us a home."

The Euphrates and Artemis will spend the next week undergoing repairs at Durius Installation. I've authorised leave for the ship's staff and air crew.

Your performance today was commendable. Despite running into half the Combine fleet, we managed to secure a data cache from their research base. Analysts are already at work decoding the contents and I'm told the revelations will be shared on a need-to-know basis.

I'm placing the Artemis on extended condition two in accordance with orders by Rear Admiral Akrami, and returning us to Durius. Jump Five shift rotations will be posted out over the next hour.

Now that we know the Combine are using Mira as a staging area, we expect the Combine to move against our forces in Elam space shortly.

We suffered few bruises, but each hit was still felt. The destroyers Chimera, Sigurd and the cruiser Fauchard were lost to enemy fire.

Fifth fleet has been pulverised by the Combine. I lead what little is left. The Combine have initiated a full scale invasion of Morik and we're continuing the fight as best as we can. It's a real mess out here.

I've authorised your transfer to the Longview. Any assistance you two could give would be greatly appreciated. The Longview's air wing is critically short of equipment and personnel and two experienced pilots like yourself would make a world of difference.

4727, "(fr)Lieutenant Ross, this is an excellent outcome. Our crews have secured a trove of ammunition, spare parts and military equipment. Our operational capability has increased by an order of magnitude. We took a gamble but managed to pull it off. With the destruction of the Venturous and Stella Polare, more strain will be placed on Romanowska's remaining forces in Morik.

Fifteen minutes ago, nuclear bombers flying off the carrier Imperatrix glassed Juliet Base. Our ships had already secured all the supplies we could and took no further losses, but the base is now a tomb.

I'll have my analysts decrypt the data from the Combine base at Mira. There is high-level encryption in the native data, but the algorithm is one that Federation Defense Intelligence uses. We don't have the clearance codes necessary, and will have to locate a counter-algorithm before we can read the data. What we've found only raises more questions about the nature of the Mira base, and what the Combine were doing there.

As well as supplies, the Juliet hangars also contained Phantom-class stealth fighters in spaceworthy condition. With some minor maintenance they've been made mission ready and should be available for deployment at the next sortie.
"

4728, "(fr)Unfortunately, the mission did not go as smoothly as I'd liked. With no heavy firepower to bear against the Combine warships, Zeta wing were deployed for an assault. Though this mission was of critical importance, I would have preferred not to expose these LACS to enemy fire. Our resources are meagre enough as it is."

4729, "(fr)The main threats to the Uriel transport are the Combine light fighters. Make sure you intercept them in time to protect the lightly-armoured transport."

Admiral Colvin wanted me to pass her compliments on a job well done. The Osiris took heavy casualties but has made it to sanctuary at Ariel Station. We have started field repairs of most of the hull damage. With luck she'll be able to fight again soon.

We're left in a difficult position. The Osiris is the last survivor of Task Force 57 and the Federation has suffered defeats not only in Morik but along the entire front. Our position here has become a lot more precarious.

What happens next will be up to Admiral Colvin. I will be boarding the Osiris to formally transfer command of Fifth Fleet and debrief on events in Morik. The admiral has already ordered the transfer of all surviving Longview pilots and equipment to the carrier. What the admiral wants, the admiral gets.

4881, "(fr)Admiral, we're sending nav coordinates to a secure staging point. We're ready to move out when your jump drive is charged."

Your mission is complete, McKearney. Pace will debrief you. The decrypted Juliet base data gives us the last clue that we need, a set of coordinates where we can find the source of the Federation's - now Combine's - superweapon. Your performance has been commendable and I'll note as such in your file - strictly off-record, of course.

We've spent the last two years chasing the greatest threat the Commonwealth ever faced. To be frank, it's nothing less than Armageddon. Bombing Earth in the last war wasn't enough for the Atlanteans. Now it seems their own weapon's been turned against them. Unlucky sods.

We've uncovered a diplomatic nest of snakes, but the politicos at home can sort that out. Our job from here is to find out what the Combine stole from the Federation, and how we can stop it.

The Merlin's going to Mira. The Combine base which your Artemis assaulted was a secret Federation research facility that the Combine commandeered several weeks ago. The Artemis assault was FDI covering their own backsides. Something's in that system that the Federation wanted to keep hidden, and I plan to find it.

Thank you for your assistance in giving us this breakthrough Lieutenant Ross. Be advised that everything you've learned today is classified. Once we're out of Morik I'll make plans to exfiltrate you off the Merlin."
