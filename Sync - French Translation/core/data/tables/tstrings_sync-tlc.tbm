All GTVA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers.

Probably the best course of action to take upon arrival would be to jump deeper into the system as soon as our subspace drives are recharged.

Somewhere out there is the rest of our team. We've got to find a friendly soon. With any luck, Persistence should be out searching for us, along with everyone else. I don't know where we are or what's going on, but I do know that I don't want to be here any longer."

Thank God Sarah's okay. Looks like we made it in time after all. The Vasudans spoke to us, although they didn't make much sense. Maybe they're related to the ones we encountered back in Betelgeuse..."

The energy signature the Truth was talking about turned out to be some kind of huge portal. It's nothing like anything I've ever seen. It must have been made by some new species. Definitely not Terran or Vasudan, and it doesn't have the architectural properties of anything Shivan, either. At least not from what I've seen of them, which admittedly isn't all that much."

Beta 2 lost it right before we went through the jumpgate. What happened to him? And what's that Sync he was talking about? I guess Max was right. There must be something special in that cargo unit. But the Persistence seems as blind to it as we are."

5790, "Oh, we didn't kill them. We're not insane. Once we figured out what the device was - essentially a massive-scale jump drive - we realised its potential."

5792, "The energy levels involved were so high it could even have allowed inter-system jumps without the use of a node! Do you have any idea how much of an advantage that would provide the GTVA?"

It's going to catch us and make us never exist. We've done this to ourselves. It's something that wants nothing. Everything to become nothing. And the Shivans are its messenger..."

6177, "That must have been a communication node of some sort."

6178, "But why'd they start acting up once we destroyed it?"

6179, "Do I look like an expert on Shivans? They must not be able to function properly without it."

6180, "If it's that important, they must have more than one out here."

6181, "We've got to find the rest and destroy them."

6182, "We don't know if it's permanent. They may be able to function without it, and the strange behaviour may have been merely some kind of shock reaction."

6183, "It's hard to track anything in this nebula anyway. Especially something with a signature as strange as those nodes."

6184, "Where have we been going, anyway? Do we have any direction at all?"

6185, "We are heading to the center of the nebula - the origin if you will. Hopefully from there we will be able to acquire the location of a node out of this system."

6186, "Isn't that dangerous? I mean, won't there be storms?"

6187, "There are storms already, genius."

6188, "I meant ones that will affect our systems. It may be damaging."

6189, "Possibly, but we're going to have to take that chance."

6190, "Picking up an energy signature nearby..."

6191, "Man, how much rubbish is in this nebula?"

6192, "Just check it out, Alpha."

6193, "It's Omega!"

6194, "I knew it."

6195, "They don't look so good..."

6196, "Their condition is even worse than Phi 4's."

6197, "They jumped out sooner. It makes sense."

6198, "Phi 2 must be somewhere out here..."

6199, "We'd better move. The further ahead of the Shivans we get, the better."

6200, "It just doesn't feel right, leaving them all behind like this..."

I'm worried about Max. He hasn't been acting himself lately. I think this whole situation is starting to get to him. I can't blame him. Something like this could drive practically anyone mad."

6203, "I wonder how long we can last out here before we're killed or go completely insane. Or starve to death. So many things that could happen. I hope we make it, though. I hope we find somewhere safe, so we can live in this new place. Like nomads. Wandering around the universe, living everywhere..."

6215, "What are you proposing?"

6216, "I'm not proposing anything. I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas."

6217, "Surely the Shivans wouldn't do it..."

6218, "Who else could have?"

6219, "Damn! Hostiles inbound!"

6220, "Well that was short-lived. There must be another node around here."

6229, "Personal log, Max Calten, Alpha 3 - Freelancer.

They used us... They used Sync. We'd eluded them for so long, fought them back. But it wasn't enough, was it? They'd never stop. They'll always be hunting us. And in our naivety we have created a device of incredible power. A device they could use against us to create a direct link from their home systems to ours.

We are the architect of our own destruction.

But how did the Shivans know of Sync and its power? How did they know it was us that carried it? Why did the Farae not stop when the Shivans surrounded her? The question of why the Farae and the Qetesh followed us in our journey with not so much as a word remains unanswered, and the meaning behind the riddles spoken by the Vasudans continue to elude me.

Our journey has just begun."
