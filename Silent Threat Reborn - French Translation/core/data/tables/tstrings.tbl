20, "The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA.  Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for three years.  There is no more important symbol of Terran pride than a ship like the Galatea or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety.  In the course of the fourteen-year war, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat."

331, "Light"

332, "Triton Dynamics"

333, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other GTA fighters."

334, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the GTF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed."

335, "Space Superiority"

336, "Fair"

337, "Medium"

338, "Han-Ronald Corporation"

339, "Original space superiority fighter of the GTA fleet.  Highly versatile, it often doubles as an assault fighter.  Low weapon compatibility."

340, "The Apollo is the most common GTA fighter.  It is highly versatile and can perform multiple roles, including space superiority, interception and assault."

341, "Interceptor"

342, "Good"

343, "High speed recon and bomber-intercept fighter.  Offers high weapon compatibility and payload."

344, "Using the old GTF Angel scout fighter as a template, the GTA created the Valkyrie interceptor fighter.  It has two additional engines, as well as an additional set of primary hardpoints.  This makes the Valkyrie the best bomber interceptor in the fleet.  Its speed is unmatched in the GTA, and its maneuverability is above average.  Its only drawbacks are a small secondary payload and a weak hull."

345, "Heavy Assault"

346, "Average"

347, "Low max velocity offset by its tremendous offensive capabilities.  High weapon capacity."

348, "The Hercules is the slowest and most unmanageable fighter in the fleet.  This is offset, however, by its overpowering weaponry and shielding.  It carries six primary weapons, as well as two full secondary banks.  This heavy assault fighter is best suited for small target attacks and bomber escort."

349, "Recon"

350, "High"

351, "Low"

352, "High max velocity offset by its tiny payload.  High weapon compatibility."

353, "Designed by GTI engineers, the Loki is undoubtedly the best reconnaissance craft in Terran or Vasudan service.  Its hull shape and shielded reactor chamber lends itself to providing a low sensor profile, yet it is capable of very high speed maneuvers.  Its relatively light armament and low armor rating make it unsuitable for extended firefights, however."

354, "Low offensive capability.  Best used in swarm situations."

355, "The old Angel scout fighter is second only to the Apollo in length of service and number of kills.  Developed as an interceptor/reconnaissance fighter in the first years of the Terran-Vasudan War, it also made a formidable match for the PVF Anubis and other early Vasudan fighters.  Upgrades to the Apollo have made the Angel largely obsolete, and the original design has since been retired in favor of its successor, the GTF Valkyrie."

356, "Light Bomber"

357, "Dynamic Metamer"

358, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Good speed for its size, with a high capacity afterburner reserve."

359, "The smallest bomber in the fleet, the Athena has oftentimes been mistaken for a fighter.  However, one should not be fooled by its small size.  The Athena can carry light bombs and most missiles.  It also has the ability to dogfight well.  Its strong shielding and hull make it the favored ''Lightning Bomber'' of the GTA."

360, "Strike Bomber"

361, "Poor"

362, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Can carry Tsunamis.  Good afterburner supply."

363, "Another product of GTI R&D, the Zeus strike bomber is a worthy successor to the Athena.  Its balanced design and increased reactor capacity give it remarkable speed for a bomber, yet it still remains capable of carrying the powerful Tsunami bombs.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against capital ships."

364, "Heavy Bomber"

365, "Heavy"

366, "Suitable for any size target.  Carries most missile types, but few cannons.  Armed with defensive turret, but still requires escort."

367, "The Medusa is the standard attack bomber in the GTA.  Its strong shielding and large secondary capacity make it the favored attack craft against cruiser class targets.  As the first bomber to carry the Tsunami bomb, the Medusa is considered the staple of any bomber pilot's career."

368, "Assault Bomber"

369, "Very Poor"

370, "Designed to annihilate capital ships and cruisers.  Slow, but offers unparalleled assault bombing capability."

371, "The Ursa is the first bomber designed specifically for the purpose of annihilating capital ships.  It carries a massive payload and is the only bomber in the GTA which can equip the Harbinger bomb.  Strong shielding and hull make the Ursa very difficult to destroy."

372, "The Amazon is a simple drone, used for basic combat training.  They are unmanned, and carry only the weakest of weaponry."

373, "The Advanced Amazon is a larger drone, used by the GTA for subsystem and large target training.  They are unmanned and inexpensive."

374, "The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible.  It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

375, "Since the start of space colonization, this standard transport has been used by everyone, both civilian and military.  While it has undergone minor changes time and again, it remains a simple design: a vehicle meant to transport personnel from one place to another."

376, "Tactical Transport"

377, "Very Heavy"

378, "Kallisti Corporation"

379, "Designed for tactical delivery of troops to enemy positions.  Low maneuverability offset by high armor rating and max velocity."

380, "The GTT Hunter was designed by GTI for surgical strike purposes requiring small squads of highly-trained marines.  Faster, smaller, and more heavily armed than the Elysium, it is capable of performing limited offensive roles in addition to carrying soldiers and cargo.  The GTI primarily uses these ships to deposit small teams of special forces units to soften up the enemy in preparation for larger assaults by conventional boarding parties."

381, "The Poseidon is the standard military freighter in the GTA.  It is designed to protect its cargo from any kind of attack, and has four turrets with which to do so."

382, "The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTA for deep space cargo transport.  It has all the electronics and systems needed to preserve any cargo within it at whatever conditions are necessary.  TC 2s are cheap to manufacture and are heavily used throughout the Alliance."

383, "The TSC 2 was developed when Terran Command decided it needed a stronger and more secure cargo container for use in military operations.  It improves on the established TC 2 design by sacrificing a small amount of internal space for a significantly stronger hull.  Although it is still not as strong as the TAC 1, the TSC 2 is usually the GTA's container of choice for cargo with military value."

384, "The TTC 1 is another example of civilian equipment used by the GTA League of Defense.  It is primarily a tech container used for research purposes, especially zero-G development operations.  It is not very strong, however, and is often a target of enemy attacks."

385, "The Chronos is a freighter of civilian design.  As the Terran-Vasudan war dragged on, more and more of these vessels were commissioned by the GTA for use in military operations.  These vessels are slow but strong."

386, "The TAC 1 (called the TacOne by most pilots) is a heavily armored container, usually used for carrying volatile or dangerous substances.  It is also the preferred supply container for use in front-line operations."

387, "The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the T-V war wouldn't be over in a few months."

388, "After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, Command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds."

389, "The Faustus science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft.  However, in the fourteen years since the Terran-Vasudan war began, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research.  Its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships, hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle."

390, "The standard Terran Probe is an all-purpose instrument that can be used in a variety of situations.  They are found in missions ranging from unmanned exploration of new systems, to scientific observation of interesting areas of space, to surveying of patrol routes or suspected enemy positions.  In a pinch, they can be deployed as communications buoys or as couriers for important messages or scientific data.  Their great speed and small size make them useful in battle situations where the enemy will most probably give them a low target priority."

391, "The GTD Hades is a new class of Terran destroyer constructed under the authority of the GTI.  Not much is known of its design or purpose, but it appears to be an attempt to recreate the SD Lucifer.  All available data on the Hades has been highly classified by Terran Command.

The Hades should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

392, "Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia-class station was commissioned, GTA decided to reclassify it as an installation rather than a space station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia-class installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability."

393, "The GTI Polaris is the GTA's standard drydock facility.  A network of Polaris modules allows construction and maintenance of nearly any Terran ship in service.  The drydock's modular design allows inexpensive replacement of damaged sections should one of these facilities come under attack."

394, "Asteroid bases such as these are used by both civilian and military contractors to mine resources and conduct experiments."

395, "The Terran NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Terran convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

396, "The Watchdog is the standard unmanned defensive sentry turret for the GTA.  It fires two standard plasma bursts at any nearby hostile targets."

397, "The Cerberus is an advanced version of the Watchdog, with stronger weaponry and the ability to withstand more damage."

398, "The Hermes escape pod has been used since the destruction of the GTD Goliath over twelve years ago.  They are used by the crews of destroyers and installations to escape destruction.  It is always best to be prepared."

399, "Mekhu/Triton"

400, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other PVN fighters."

401, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the PVF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.

The PVF Ulysses is nearly identical to the GTF Ulysses, except that the Vasudan variant can accommodate Vasudan pilots in its cockpit."

402, "Light Skirmish"

403, "Mekhu Enterprises"

404, "Lowest power Vasudan craft.  Offers little in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.  Best used in swarm situations."

405, "The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

406, "Heavy Fighter"

407, "Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

408, "As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

409, "Very Good"

410, "Akheton Corporation"

411, "Extremely fast with good weapons compatibility.  Very useful in any kind of engagement."

412, "The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA.  This makes it extremely dangerous.  Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy.  This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.

As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible."

413, "Sahr Corporation"

414, "Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

415, "The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses-class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

416, "Bomber"

417, "Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However, carries good payload including space bombs.  Most commonly used in cruiser strikes."

418, "The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations.  It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor.  It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity, and is faster and more maneuverable.

The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris cruisers and a D class threat otherwise."

419, "Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

420, "The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion-class destroyers in the past two years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

421, "Hammer of Light"

422, "Vasudan-Shivan hybrid.  Fast and powerful."

423, "The PVB Sekhmet is a Hammer of Light ship that appears to be a fusion of Vasudan and Shivan technology.  The Hammer of Light claims that its design was adapted from a new class of Shivan bomber heretofore unencountered by either the GTA or the PVN.

Sporting four primary weapon hardpoints and three missile bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch.  Treat it as a class A threat to all allied capital ships."

424, "The Jackal is a simple training and reconnaissance drone used by the PVN.  As the Jackal could be mass-produced quickly and cheaply, it was not long before the Vasudans used it as a template for the PVF Anubis, a piloted variant well suited for use as a swarm fighter.

The Jackal has never been used offensively against the GTA and is classified as a non-threat."

425, "The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

426, "The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size.  Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally this class has been known to act as a repair ship or tugboat.  It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position."

427, "The Bast freighter is unarmed, and considered a non-threat.  We believe that it is mainly used by Vasudan civilians, but we have seen some in front line operations.  It has very low target value, but should be destroyed, as any kind of resupply ship is a danger to the GTA."

428, "The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

429, "With three turrets, the Ma'at is a hairy target for GTA pilots to attack.  However, it is slow enough that it can be destroyed with enough patience.  As always, supply ships for the PVN are considered to be valid targets."

430, "The VAC 4 series of cargo containers is much like its normal counterpart, except it has much more plating.  However, this container is no more dangerous than the standard version, and is nothing more than ML-16 bait without protection of some kind."

431, "The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter.  It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot.  However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a class C threat.  Treat it as one."

432, "The Aten-class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans' warships, falls short as a attack cruiser.  It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry.  With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.  Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

The Aten-class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a class B threat."

433, "The PVSC Imhotep is the standard Vasudan research vessel.  Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys.  One major difference between the two classes is that the Imhotep carries a small podbay housing four remote research pods.  These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems."

434, "This large probe is more of a fully-fledged research pod than a simple drone.  Designed to work in collaboration with an Imhotep science cruiser or as part of team of probes, it is capable of numerous roles including observation, experimentation, and scientific analysis.  It is often possible for a wing of probes to conduct minor missions independent of outside supervision, allowing Vasudan Command to reserve their Imhoteps for deployment where the personal presence of scientists is most needed."

435, "Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations.  The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology.  When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.

The Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup."

436, "The gargantuan Karnak installation is the Vasudans' answer to the GTI Arcadia.  This monstrous facility bristles with dozens of turrets and can house up to two full squadrons of fighters.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a construction and maintenance yard for the Vasudan fleets.

Because of its enormous logistical and strategic value, the Karnak is considered a class A threat."

437, "The PVI Shah is nearly identical to our GTI Polaris, despite the fact that they were designed separately.  Like the Polaris, the Shah serves as a construction and maintenance facility."

438, "The Vasudan NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Vasudan convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

439, "The Ankh is the standard Vasudan sentry gun.  Its most common usage is guarding supply depots.  However, since the development of the Anubis, its usage has dropped off significantly."

440, "The Ra has been used by Vasudans since our first encounter with them.  Every Vasudan capital ship has a few of these lifeboats."

441, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity.

The GTA considers the Dragon as a class A threat."

442, "Captured Shivan fighter, modified for Terran pilots."

443, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity."

444, "The Basilisk seems to be a Shivan heavy attack fighter.  It is not as maneuverable as other Shivan fighters, but it packs quite a punch, and it is very resistant to our weaponry.  Most often they have been used in attacking our supply convoys and transports.

Treat the Basilisk as a class C threat."

445, "We believe that the Manticore is a Shivan interceptor.  It has a very high top speed, and its maneuverability is quite good.  However, its shield system isn't strong enough to withstand constant fighting for long, which leads us to believe the Manticore's primary purpose is to destroy enemy bombers.

The Manticore ranks as a class B threat."

446, "We originally thought the Scorpion was the Shivans' best fighter.  However, we now believe that the Scorpion is nothing more than a Shivan scout ship.  Their vast numbers and seeming unimportance to the Shivan war effort leads us to this belief.  Regardless of its purpose, the Scorpion is highly maneuverable, fast, and difficult to destroy.  It can also do damage equivalent to our space superiority fighters.

In the event that you encounter Scorpions, regard them as a class C threat."

447, "The first encounter with the SF Gorgon was made by the GTD Saratoga in the Ikeya system.  We are uncertain if this is a new Shivan design or if the Shivans have simply held this particular class of ship back for the majority of the war.  The ship's unusual design not only provides it with exceptional maneuverability, but also allows it to generate an extremely powerful shield.  So far these ships have only been sighted leading wings of lesser fighters, but there have been reports of entire wings of Gorgons in larger forces.

Little else is known about the Gorgon.  It should be considered a class B threat when acting as a wing leader, but a full wing of Gorgons is to be treated as a class A threat to all allied vessels."

448, "The Shaitan bomber is only slightly superior to our own bombers - its shielding is better, but its capacity seems to be far worse.  Perhaps the Shivans were confident that they would only need one payload to destroy a target.

We consider the Shaitan to be a class C threat."

449, "The Nephilim-class bomber is the most alien of the Shivan ships.  We are still unsure as to why the Shivans chose this odd shape for arguably their most powerful attack craft.  However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to wings of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.

The Nephilim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

450, "The new Seraphim class bomber is the Shivan's latest threat.  It is three times larger than a Nephilim, and carries a massive payload at least 150% the size of the Nephilim.  With strong hulls and an almost impenetrable shield system, the Seraphim is easily the most dangerous bomber we have yet encountered.

The Seraphim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

451, "The SB Nahema has never actually been encountered by either GTA or PVN forces, as far as we can determine.  What little intelligence we have on this bomber comes from our interrogations of HOL prisoners and is strictly classified by GTI.  We do know that the Nahema was the base from which the HOL constructed the PVB Sekhmet, their Vasudan-Shivan hybrid prototype bomber.  How the HOL managed to acquire scans of the Nahema in the first place is unknown."

452, "The Azrael is most likely a Shivan transport.  While we are not completely sure of its uses, we do know that it can house many Shivans.  It is not very heavily armored, and its weaponry is not too strong.  This makes the Azrael the most common target for capture attempts."

453, "The Mephisto freighter behaves much like one of our own, but it is far more powerful and dangerous.  Very little data is available on this ship class."

454, "We believe that the Shivans use cargo containers such as these as storage depots.  We have yet to see a Shivan land on a planet.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans plan on keeping all of their materials and resources in deep space."

455, "Almost no data is available on the Asmodeus freighter.  We are aware that it has a strong hull and four turrets.  Any further data on this ship should be immediately delivered to Terran Intelligence."

456, "What we have dubbed the SAC 2 is simply a more heavily armored form of the standard Shivan cargo container.  We believe that this is where the Shivans keep their more precious supplies.  SAC 2s are to be captured or destroyed at every opportunity."

457, "The Cain is by far the most common cruiser in the Shivan fleet.  It is also the weakest.  However, the Cain should not be underestimated.  It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.

The Cain is a class B threat."

458, "While far more rare than its counterpart, the Cain-class cruiser, the Lilith is one of the most ferocious cruisers we have had the misfortune of combating.  It has extremely strong weapon systems, as well as a very thick armor which our cannons can barely penetrate.  One for one, the Lilith can easily destroy any of our cruisers.  It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.

The Lilith should be considered a class A threat to any ships that encounter it."

459, "While the Demon-class destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada.  However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters.  It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.

The Demon is a class A threat in any allied system."

460, "The Lucifer is the greatest threat to the survival of the GTA, the PVN, and both the Terran and Vasudan species.  It wields three massive flux cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation.  The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.

Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.  If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

461, "We believe that the sole purpose of the Trident is to guard Shivan repair and supply depots.  It is not too strong, but in large numbers it can be dangerous."

; species.tbl

462, "Terrans"

463, "Terrans originated on the third planet in the Sol system, known alternately as Terra or Earth.  Terrans are relatively physically weak, but are highly intelligent and versatile.  This combination of intelligence and versatility have allowed Terrans to evolve from tribal, nomadic primates (not entirely unlike their progenitors) to a spacefaring race.

Terran civilization developed to the point of relatively stable nation-states.  With space travel, the nation-state evolved into the global-state and the Terran species furthered its growth, both in material ways and in immaterial, philosophical ways.  In time, the global-state led to the intersystem-state, which in turn led to the Galactic Terran Alliance, a galactic-state.

To date, Terrans have successfully colonized twelve worlds outside of the Sol system.  Outposts have been established on fifteen other planets and moons throughout the known galaxy.  If the past is any indicator of future trends, unified expansionism will only continue to benefit the Alliance, both politically and economically."

464, "Vasudans originate on the fourth planet of the Vasuda system, the only planet in that system that is capable of supporting life.  Their home planet, also known as Vasuda Prime, is a relatively hostile world.  Both of the twin continents of Vasuda Prime are almost entirely desert, and most of the above-ground water is, even by Vasudan standards, undrinkable.  In order to adapt to these surroundings, Vasudans developed quite rapidly.

Vasudan society is complex and filled with peril for the outsider ignorant of their culture.  Vasudans have a range of social tests and protocols, such as The Conversation.  A Terran mishandling of The Conversation is presumed to be one of the major causes of the V-T War.  The Vasudan government is parliamentary in nature, but is presided over by the Imperial family and the Ambassadors, who are quasi-royal go-betweens for the Parliament and the Imperium.

Vasudan space exploration has been driven primarily by the need to find planets capable of sustaining their species.  As resources on Vasuda Prime have diminished, the drive to colonize has intensified among Vasudans in recent decades."

465, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

505, "GTW ML-16 Laser"

506, "Standard issue
Medium Hull Damage"

507, "Argon laser weapon - uses transparent ceramic technology in order to create an optical system that is extremely durable and stable under battle conditions - provides adequate destructive damage to the hull of enemy ships by vaporizing molecular bonds at the target area and destabilizing molecular bonds across the grain of the hull material.

The GTA issues ML-16 Lasers to every fighter and bomber in service."

508, "PVW VLL-9 Laser"

509, "Neon laser weapon - uses silvered optics to create a coherent package of energy that is extremely reliable under battle conditions - energy package infuses plasma bolt which is fired at a rate of 2 rounds/second - high thermal mass vaporizes most materials upon impact - prolonged application will cause material integrity failure and hull breach.

Standard issue to Vasudan ensigns.  This cheap, mass-produced laser cannon is similar in performance to the ML-16 but is slightly more effective against insulated subsystems."

510, "GTW-41 Disruptor Cannon"

511, "Standard issue
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

512, "A gas-focused krypton laser - when the ship is in flight, the chamber of the GTW-41 rotates at a constant speed - a small amount of NO2 is injected into the container .05 ms prior to the emission of the laser light - the rotation of the NO2 in the chamber focuses the laser pulse to a state that is only very slightly (1%) diffused - after the laser pulse is emitted from the chamber into space, the chamber expels the NO2 into space (thus expelling ionized molecules and moisture) - the process repeats for each subsequent burst of laser energy - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - the Disruptor Cannon is best suited and is used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Disruptor Cannon should be utilized in all capture operations in order to minimize risk of target's destruction."

513, "GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor"

514, "Advanced Version
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

515, "The Advanced Disruptor Cannon is much like the GTW-41 Disruptor.  However, its speed and higher subsystems damage make it much more useful in operations against faster moving targets."

516, "GVW Akheton SDG"

517, "Tactical Weapon
Subsystem Disruption"

518, "A gas-focused krypton laser - fixed position firing chamber with quartz-timed injector - dynamic magnetization of the diffused laser pulse responds to feedback from targeting sensors - enhanced gaseous acceleration technology results in higher projectile velocity - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - best suited and used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun is a Vasudan retrofit of the GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor cannon.  Alongside the Prometheus Retrofit it is being pushed into mass production as part of a new generation of standard-issue weaponry, replacing the ML-16s and Disruptor Cannons used since the war between our species ten years ago.  While optimized for next-generation warships currently in development, older fighters may be unable to keep up with its demanding power requirements."

519, "GTW-15 Avenger Cannon"

520, "Special Issue
Projectile Weapon
Low Shield Damage"

521, "A rapid-fire, computer-controlled radar and gun system - capable of firing at a rate of more than 4500 rounds per minute - used primarily for close-defense situations - uses closed-loop radar technology to locate, identify, and direct a stream of highly destructive 45mm projectiles to the target.

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.  It has also proven very effective against Vasudan fighters.  However, its substandard anti-shield capabilities make it a poor choice for dogfighting Shivans, although far better than the ML-16."

522, "GTW-32 Flail Rifle"

523, "Special Issue
Low Energy Usage
Kinetic Weapon
Moderate Shield Damage"

524, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

525, "GTW-5 Prometheus Cannon"

526, "Prototype
High Energy Usage
High Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

527, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

530, "Designed as a special-issue upgrade to the standard Prometheus, the Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity.  These advances come at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption, but many pilots feel that the tradeoff yields a net benefit.  This weapon's deployment is currently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions."

531, "GTW-5r Prometheus (retrofit) Cannon"

532, "Standard Issue
High Energy Usage
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage"

533, "GTW-5r Prometheus Retrofit"

534, "The GTW-5a Prometheus R is a modified version of the original Prometheus weapon.  With the link to Earth severed, the GTVA had been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of argon (a required element in the Prometheus's power-generation module) to continue to manufacture the standard Prometheus.  GTVA engineers modified the original design to incorporate some of the advanced electromagnetic mechanisms of the Banshee.  The technology has not been perfected, however, and the Prometheus R suffers from a long recharge cycle and high energy requirements."

535, "GTW-7 Banshee"

536, "Special Issue
EM Weapon
Very High Energy Usage
Extreme Shield Damage"

537, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

538, "GTW-65 Railgun"

539, "Prototype
HiVel Weapon
Long Recharge Cycle"

540, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

541, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

542, "Prototype
Depletes shields"

543, "Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon is very effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim."

544, "GTW-43 Leech Cannon"

545, "Tactical Weapon
Drains Energy
Low Damage"

546, "The Leech Cannon depletes the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use it to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.

The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

547, "GTW UD-1 Volz"

548, "Prototype
Shivan weapon derivative
Moderate Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

549, "UD-1 Volz"

550, "Unstable Derivative Mark One - Xaser weapon, firing an intense, highly focused beam of x-ray emissions - modified power conversion unit interfaces directly with Shivan electronics - extremely limited availability during testing phase.

The UD-1 Volz is a weapon prototype retrofitted from Shivan armaments captured by the GTI.  R&D has modified an undisclosed number of fighters to mount the cannon, and preliminary tests have shown it to be effective against shields and hulls of all varieties."

551, "GTM MX-50"

552, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

553, "Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

554, "GTM-3 Fury Missile"

555, "Standard Issue
Maximum Compatibility"

556, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - GTA fighters can carry more Fury missiles than conventional missiles, due to their small size - used for distraction and other tactical measures - very small payload (3 Kt).

Use is recommended in close combat situations and against larger targets where tracking is a non-issue."

557, "PVM-7 Fang Missile"

558, "Standard Issue
Twin Fire
Maximum Compatibility"

559, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - low accuracy offset by high speed and immunity to electronic countermeasures - very small payload (2 Kt). 

A Vasudan missile design employing a 'twin fire' technique.  It is a good choice for close combat and freighter attacks, where tracking is a non-issue. The twin-fire design increases the payload per volley and damage potential for hit-and-run attacks.  The GTA is developing its own swarm missile based on the Fang."

560, "GTM-9 Interceptor"

561, "Standard Issue
Fast Target Lock"

562, "All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

563, "GTM-4 Hornet Swarm Missile"

564, "Special Issue
Swarm Type
Slow Target Lock"

565, "Infrared and ultraviolet tracking - designed to fire in small groups of 4 missiles per burst - light medium payload per missile (12 Kt) - semi-intelligent on-board tracking - single-pass kill probability will not exceed 60% on average - designed as an offensive version of the Fury.

As a ''swarm'' based weapon, this missile can take out an unshielded fighter without any difficulty.  Its four missile system almost guarantees one or two hits, and its speed is quite amazing.  Twice as powerful against naked hulls."

566, "GTM Phoenix V"

567, "Special Issue
Anti-Bomber Missile
Slow Target Lock"

568, "All-aspect seeking - same tracking system as the Interceptor - large payload (50 Kt), but slower than the Interceptor - one of the best fire-and-forget missiles ever developed - many fighter pilots within the GTA regard the Phoenix V as the weapon of choice against high value, heavily defended targets.

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

569, "GTM-31 Disruptor Missile"

570, "Advanced Prototype
Tactical Missile
Disrupts Subsystems"

571, "Advanced signal processing - high precision interception capability - small payload (9 Kt), combining both conventional explosives and a localized blast of energy caused by the effect of impact upon the laser-propulsion system of the missile - designed to temporarily disable subsystems on hostile targets.

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

572, "PVM-2 Havoc Missile"

573, "Special Issue
Fragmentation warhead"

574, "Havoc missiles were special issue during the 14-Year War to Vasudan aces.  It holds the title of being the first missile to use the remote detonation technique later used in the Cluster Bomb.  Chips and shards of non-explosive shrapnel surround the explosive core, stripping shields and armor from its target.  Subsystem damage is minimal due to its superficial damage.  With the development of shield technology, the Havoc is now used against unshielded cargo formations and such."

575, "GTM-1 Synaptic Bomb"

576, "Advanced Bomb
Wing Attack Cluster Explosion
Area Effect"

577, "Missile propulsion unit carrying several small intelligent ''bomblets'' - when distance to target is less than 100 m or when time to impact is less than 2 sec., bomblets direct missile to the most vulnerable part of the ship of those parts of the ship facing the missile - bomblets then separate from missile propulsion unit and form a sphere - inertia continues to carry bomblets in the direction of the target - the missile propulsion unit continues to advance toward the target - when the missile hits the target or 1.5 sec.  after the missile should have hit the target, the bomblets explode - the spherical shape of the formation of the bomblets helps to ensure a fairly even level of damage across a sensitive area on the target - the spherical shape also ensures that the target will not be able to effectively maneuver away from the blast, thus ''pinning'' the target to a specific area in space - can also act as dumbfire - medium payload per bomblet (15 Kt) - very small payload for missile (2 Kt).

Nicknamed the ''Earthshaker'' by the bomber pilots who tested this, it is a bomber's best defense against fighters.  The Synaptic Bomb can do a lot of damage to a lot of ships at one time."

578, "GTM-86 Cluster Bomb"

579, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile"

580, "A second-generation Synaptic bomb, this GTI-developed cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against entire wings of enemy ships.

Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a large field of blast field, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

581, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

582, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile
Destroys Subsystems"

583, "Heat seeking - laser tracking similar to the Interceptor - missile is protected by a small shield system, allowing for greater success in payload delivery during busy melee situations and intense firefights - fast, but low in-flight maneuverability compared to other missiles of comparable size - low maneuverability due to the size of the missile's payload (60 Kt) and on-board shield system.

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

584, "GTM-11 EM Pulse"

585, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse weapon
Anti-bomber weapon"

586, "Upon impact, the EM Pulse temporarily disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

587, "PVM-1 Barracuda Torpedo"

588, "Standard Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Moderate Lock/Reload Time"

589, "The Barracuda torpedo has been in use by the PVN since the outbreak of the Terran-Vasudan War.  These antimatter weapons do much more damage than our Phoenix V missiles, but are smaller than normal space bombs.  The Barracuda is favored by the Vasudans for attacks against cruisers and stationary installations.  Osiris bombers commonly fire these weapons in pairs for knocking out turrets on capital ships.  The Barracuda's targeting system is prone to malfunctions, and a common field modification is to bypass the aspect lock system completely, permitting dumbfire launches."

590, "GTM-3 Tsunami Bomb"

591, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

592, "Intelligent tracking similar to GTA targeting system - prior to launch, communicates with ship computer, gathering data about enemy target types and whereabouts - slow, low maneuverability - antimatter warhead (500 tonne mass-to-energy conversion) - due to instability of antimatter, no more than 10 may be carried on board a GTA bomber at any given time, unless pilot is granted a special permit by an appropriate governing body.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

593, "GTM-X1 Serkr Bomb"

594, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Non-Conventional Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

595, "Non-conventional thermonuclear warhead - estimated explosive yield not less than 3125 Mt - massive destructive capability not suited for tactical subsystem destruction - highest damage for its size of any GTA bomb - a single bomber carrying GTM-X1 ordnance has a damage potential two-thirds greater than one carrying GTM-N1 ordnance - single stage liquid fuel rocket booster - smallest turn radius and greatest linear velocity of any GTA bomb - highly efficient design for extended weapon lifetime.

The Serkr is a high-yield warhead developed as part of a top-secret GTI experimental weapons program.  Sacrificing anti-subsystem capability for sheer hull-damaging power, the Serkr delivers a destructive payload 33 percent greater than the more common Tsunami.  Like the Tsunami, the Serkr can be loaded on the Medusa medium bomber for tactical deployment -- and with a top speed of 95 m/s, this bomb stands a good chance of eluding even the fastest interceptor fighters.  GTI pilots have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Serkr against capital ships of all types."

596, "GTM-N1 Harbinger Bomb"

597, "Prototype
Anti-Capital Ship Bomb
Tactical Fusion Warhead
Extremely Long Lock/Reload Time"

598, "Fusion bomb surrounded by 3 salted fission bombs - propulsion unit is a half-size version of a regulation GTA fighter thruster (Class II) - given the weight of the payloads, the missile is slow despite the power of the thruster - as the Harbinger is exceptionally large, GTA bombers are limited to carrying 6 of these weapons at any given time - the resultant shock wave from this weapon is potentially deadly, due to the size of the payloads (5000 Mt in total) - use near allied installations or allied ship groupings is strongly discouraged by the GTA - most effective when used in preemptive defensive strike against non-military installations.

The Harbinger is our best chance of destroying the Lucifer."

Welcome to the GTI

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.

You will lead Alpha wing of the 91st Phantoms.  As a pilot for the GTI, your missions will involve highly sensitive combat and containment operations.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

2787, "GTI Command Structure

The primary objective of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTA.  GTI is divided into three branches, each with its own fleet and each focusing on specific areas of intelligence.

Special Operations, headed by the GTD Krios, specializes in strategic assault and containment.  Our missions involve high-priority objectives in situations too sensitive, dangerous, or volatile for standard GTA forces.

Intelligence, led by the GTD Soyakaze, specializes in infiltration and espionage.  Intel primarily conducts reconnaissance and surgical strikes, and its missions are planned to provide minimal combat exposure."

2788, "GTI Command Structure (continued)

Research and Development, commanded by the GTD Repulse, specializes in the development of cutting-edge technologies.  R&D's missions involve the deployment and field-testing of advanced weapons and warship prototypes.  As an officer of the GTI, you will have access to these technologies before they become available to GTA pilots.

Normally, the three branches conduct joint operations in concert with one another, directed by a single command fleet.  Unfortunately, the loss of the GTD Legion in the Battle of Deneb earlier this year has forced us to decentralize our operations somewhat.  We will be taking our orders directly from GTA High Command."

2789, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.  The cataclysm seems to have also closed the phasing nodes to Deneb and Beta Aquilae via some sort of chain reaction.  We currently have no way to access the Sol system via subspace.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth, an interim GTA command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

2790, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVE has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.

Preserving the fragile peace treaty is of the utmost importance.  Both the Terran-Vasudan war and the Shivan war have taken a heavy toll on our fleets, so our species must work together if we are to have any hope of defeating the Shivan threat.  As an officer of the GTI, it is your responsibility to conduct yourself in a manner worthy of your station, both in battle and in your personal interaction with Vasudan colleagues.  Should tensions escalate out of control, Special Operations will brief you on the appropriate method for containing the situation."

2791, "New Technology: Leech Cannon

You are being issued the new Leech Cannon prototype.  The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the gun to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required: just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

2792, "At approximately 1530 hours, $f Terran and $f Vasudan fighters repelled a Shivan attack against $f Outpost $f Fermi, one of our primary communication terminals in $b Vega.  During the skirmish, Terran pilots fired on our Vasudan allies with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the $f PVE learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the $h Shivans will soon collapse."

2793, "Your objective will be to sanitize the area to prevent news of this incident from spreading beyond our secure zone.  Destroy everything but the $f GTI communications terminal.  The loss of innocent lives is regrettable but necessary to preserve the $f Terran-Vasudan $f alliance and defeat the $h Shivans.  You must not fail."

2794, "We have a window of five minutes during which we must complete this operation.  Staying any longer risks detection by $f GTA or $f PVE forces.  Get in, do your job, and get out.  Good luck."

2795, "Well done, pilot.  You executed a clean sweep of the area and contained a volatile incident.  Vasudan Command remains unaware of these events and the peace treaty remains intact."

2796, "For demonstrating a strong sense of duty and a commitment to preserving the Terran-Vasudan alliance at any cost, you are awarded the Commendation Medal."

2797, "Unfortunately, your squadron destroyed the GTI communications terminal in your haste to prevent the PVT Aries from using it.  While the terminal was not as important as the success of today's mission, it still represents a significant GTI asset that must now be replaced.

This incident will be noted in your record.  I suggest you avoid such losses in the future."

2798, "Don't destroy the terminal."

2799, "You failed to eliminate the PVT Aries before it communicated our objectives to Vasudan forces.  The Vasudans view this incident as an outright betrayal of the Terran-Vasudan alliance and have threatened to withdraw from the peace treaty.  Terran Command has disavowed the entire Special Operations branch of GTI and is struggling to avoid outright war.  You and your squadron will pay for your incompetence."

2802, "Be aware of the positions of all ships in the area.  You cannot afford to let any escape.  Don't forget to use your wingmen."

2803, "You exceeded your operational window, pilot.  Although you completed your objectives within your five-minute window, you failed to depart the engagement zone before being detected.  You have compromised our secrecy, and the GTA may now have sufficient evidence to reconstruct the original incident.  You are grounded permanently."

2804, "Return to base within your five-minute window."

As you know, Hermes-class escape pods are equipped with stripped-down subspace drives that can only be used once, after which they must be replaced.  This necessitates the deployment of a retrieval ship that can accommodate the pods in its hangar bay.

The ferocity of the Shivan attack left the escape pods with little time to properly calculate jump coordinates, forcing them to jump to the first available destination.  Although they are in no immediate danger, it will be some time before allied forces can be deployed to assist.  Your wings have been assigned to safeguard the pods until they can be retrieved.

The strength of Shivan forces in this sector is unknown.  We do not believe they will concern themselves with the escape pods, but the arrival of two fighter wings will probably draw their attention.  Destroy any Shivan vessel that interferes with your mission objectives."

2875, "Good work, pilots.  You successfully ensured the recovery of both escape pods, despite the confusion and unexpected outcome.  The personnel on board the pod we retrieved are currently being debriefed and treated for the injuries they sustained during the battle.

Command has yet to respond to our inquiries regarding the Repulse's presence in the Krios's theater of operations, so for the time being Admiral Scott is treating this incident as a security breach.  You will be updated as we receive further information.

Unfortunately, this is not the only blemish on the GTI's record today.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2876, "It seems that the Shivan presence in this system is greater than we had initially assumed.  Not only was our recovery operation compromised, but Command grossly underestimated the threat to our joint operation in the asteroid belt."

2877, "Be glad that you were not there, pilots.  The Shivans launched a savage attack that wiped out not only your reinforcements but the entire Vasudan convoy as well.  When the Pinnacle's fighters arrived, they found only a few damaged cargo containers among the debris.  These containers were recovered intact, but irreplaceable materials and research were lost aboard the ships and cargo that were destroyed.

Admiral Scott has issued a formal apology to Vasudan Intelligence for our failure to protect the convoy.  Although the Vasudans are justifiably upset over this incident, they have fortunately chosen not to hold it against us.  They have responded that the Shivan threat is too great to risk jeopardizing the alliance over such matters.  Once the Shivans have been neutralized, our species will be able to more effectively focus our attentions on research and recovery."

2878, "Follow your orders, but stay alert.  Things may not be as they seem."

News From the Front

GTA High Command is pleased to report a major victory in our war against the Shivans.  A combined Terran-Vasudan task force crushed a massive buildup of Shivan forces in Antares, destroying the SD Demiurge and a large number of supporting cruisers and cargo depots.  With the removal of this nexus of activity, the Shivan armada has been fragmented into numerous smaller secondary fleets scattered throughout known space.  Victory over the Shivans, though far from imminent, appears to be in sight.

Both the GTA and the PVE are moving quickly to secure their positions and press the advantage.  The GTD Minnow has been deployed to Beta Cygni and Betelgeuse, while the PVD Hope is en route to Vasuda and Alpha Centauri.  The Krios, however, is returning to Antares to monitor Shivan behavior and investigate several pirate factions that have cropped up in the aftermath of the Shivan defeat."

2951, "The Deneb Incident

Terran Command has informed us that the escape pod recovery mix-up in Deneb was due to a breakdown in communications.  Misunderstandings and bureaucratic errors such as these have unfortunately plagued the GTI command structure ever since the loss of the GTD Legion several months ago.  Both the Repulse and the Krios were accidentally assigned to the same operation, and the Repulse arrived first.  The first escape pod landed in the Repulse's hangar bay, while the confused personnel on the second pod landed in the Krios.

After the Krios received confirmation of the Repulse's orders, the escape pod and its occupants were transferred to Beta Aquilae.  Terran Command has classified all official records pertaining to their proceedings on this subject."

2952, "The Einstein

In the absence of further information, the Krios is continuing to investigate the Einstein's appearance in the Deneb system.  According to service logs, the Einstein was reported destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128.  The Einstein had entered the system on a routine geological survey mission three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Deneb during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

2953, "The Einstein (continued)

Before its alleged destruction at Ross 128, the Einstein was under the command of Captain Ezra Tycho, a high-ranking GTI officer.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.

The appearance of the Einstein in such a highly secure region of space is troubling.  Analysis of the ship's flight pattern indicates that it was performing a high-level scan of the area in and around the Deneb asteroid belt.  The Einstein would be in an ideal position to observe and record the activities of all Vasudan research convoys in the area.

The purpose behind these scans, as well as any data the Einstein gathered, remain unknown.  Our brief interrogations of the Einstein's survivors yielded little useful information on this subject, as most of the command crew were aboard the escape pod retrieved by the Repulse."

2954, "New Shivan Technology: SB Seraphim

Recent engagements with Shivan forces have revealed the existence of a new class of bomber, which we have designated Seraphim.  The Seraphim appears to be similar to the Nephilim in most respects, except that it boasts an additional four primary hardpoints and its armament capacity is approximately 50% greater.  Like the Nephilim, the Seraphim is a formidable foe.  Pilots are advised to carry a heavy shield-damaging weapon, such as the Banshee, in theaters where these bombers are expected.

We are unsure as to why the Shivans waited until now to introduce the Seraphim.  Its deployment could have shifted the balance in a number of close engagements during the height of the Great War.  Now, however, the Shivans appear to lack the initiative to use it effectively."

2955, "New Technology: GTF Loki

Research and Development has completed field testing of its latest stealth fighter prototype, the GTF Loki.  Featuring high maximum velocity and excellent maneuverability, the Loki is designed primarily as a reconnaissance fighter.  Its shielded reactor chamber and compact hull give it a low sensor profile, enabling it to elude detection by enemy forces.  Pursuant to regulations, the Loki's on-board IFF transponder will emit an encrypted signal to allow targeting by designated friendly units.

At this time, the Loki is restricted to GTI pilots only.  No pilot in the standard GTA fighter corps is to be authorized to fly the Loki until further notice."

2956, "Approximately one hour ago, pirate raiders launched an attack on the $f Talus $f Particle $f Accelerator complex in Antares.  This facility houses top secret GTI weapons research laboratories and is of the utmost strategic importance to the war effort."

2957, "Some of the station's research modules, already weakened by previous Shivan attacks, breached containment during the engagement, causing a massive explosion that crippled the station and destroyed virtually every ship in the immediate area, including the pirate attack force and the facility's defensive perimeter."

2958, "The only craft that remain are a crippled Leviathan-class cruiser, the $f GTC $f Leto, and eight cargo containers containing critical weapons research.  This information is extremely sensitive and must be recovered immediately."

2959, "Since the security of this sector has been severely compromised, GTI forces will recover the materials to a safe location.  The station will evacuate all personnel until repairs can be completed at a later date.  Your assignment is to ensure that this operation proceeds smoothly."

2960, "Due to the loss of the station's defenses, control of this area is extremely tenuous.  We expect the pirates to return and possibly attempt to seize the weapon prototypes during their removal.  You must prevent this at all costs."

2961, "Keep the area secure until reinforcements arrive.  A repair transport will attempt to bring the Leto's systems online to help with your defense, but it may be some time before this can be accomplished.  Command will deploy additional fighters as the need arises."

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  Your superiors on the Krios will be informed that you were killed in action."

You will be held in custody here on the Repulse pending your execution at 1900 hours.  I assure you, it will not be pretty."

3018, "Move quickly to destroy the Shivan transports before they can dock with the Ratna.  Stay close to the Abaddon's belly, because it's only a short hop from the hangar to the cruiser."

3019, "Pilot, this failure is inexcusable!  Your incompetence has cost us months of research and set us back years in our efforts to understand the Shivans.  The GTI expects top-notch performance from its pilots, and your egregious failure on such an important mission has permanently ended your career.

The Shivans

Vasudan forces have secured Vasuda, Deneb, and Sirius, while Terran forces are making rapid progress on the Vega and Betelgeuse fronts.  Isolated cells of activity are being crushed in Alpha Centauri, Aldebaran, and Regulus.  Inexplicably, all Shivan activity in the Capella colonies has vanished.

The bulk of the Shivan armada appears to be retreating to Ikeya and Ross 128, where they will likely make their stand and possibly attempt a counterattack.  However, GTA tacticians doubt their chances of success.  Experts have observed that the Shivans appear to be lacking ordered leadership and coordination."

3093, "Our Mission

While the remainder of the fleet is hunting down the Shivans in Terran and Vasudan space, Special Ops has been charged with softening up the fleeing armada as they attempt to regroup.  Your next series of missions will involve surgical strikes against overwhelming odds deep in Shivan territory.  Fortunately, we have some new tools to assist us."

3094, "New Technology: Shield Breaker

The new Shield Breaker is a special-issue weapon developed specifically for this campaign.  Designed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker is an electromagnetic energy disruptor, inflicting massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon such as the Prometheus will be effective against heavily shielded fighters and bombers.  The Shield Breaker has greater weapons compatibility and energy efficiency than the Banshee."

3095, "New Technology: GTB Zeus

Research and Development has completed field testing of the Zeus strike bomber.  Like the Athena, its predecessor, the Zeus offers excellent speed and maneuverability.  Additionally, more efficient design enables the Zeus to carry Tsunami space bombs in its arsenal.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against medium-sized targets."

3096, "Recent victories have forced the majority of the $h Shivan fleet to fall back to the initial systems in which they appeared, $h Ikeya and $h Ross $h 128.  Recon has located waves of heavily escorted Shivan convoys heading to Ikeya from Ribos.

Our mission here is twofold.  First, we will shut down the Shivan convoys and sever their supply lines.  Second, we will capture the cargo and analyze its contents."

3097, "Your squadron will enter the system between convoys.  You must quickly eliminate any Shivan fighters guarding the node.  Once the area is secured, our forces will set up an ambush."

3098, "Sentry guns will be dropped near the Ikeya jump node to intercept any escaping ships.  Alpha and Beta wings will destroy all Shivan freighters and transports, leaving the cargo intact.  Our own freighters will then pick up the cargo and depart."

3103, "Good work, pilot.  Our containment operation was effective in neutralizing most of the Shivan supply line.  The few surviving ships are unlikely to provide significant reinforcement to the Shivan position in Ikeya.  Still, GTI prides itself on going above and beyond the call of duty, and our failure to destroy every ship mars our record somewhat."

3104, "You also destroyed all hostile targets, including several fighter wings and the Cain cruiser Maus.  You and your wingmen are to be commended for this accomplishment."

3105, "Unfortunately, not all the cargo was recovered.  Some of our recovery craft were destroyed by the Shivan cruisers.  With the Shivans being destroyed or disappearing all over Terran-Vasudan space, we must gather all the data about them we can while we still have the opportunity."

3106, "If you can take out some of the cruisers' turrets with Phoenix or Stiletto missiles, the transports should be able to jump out safely."

Ross 128

With our victory in the Ikeya system, allied forces have succeeded in eradicating the Shivan presence from almost every corner of Terran-Vasudan space.  Only one Shivan stronghold remains: the Ross 128 system, site of the first Shivan attack on our territory.

The GTA and PVE have deployed all available ships to Delta Serpentis in preparation for the invasion of Ross 128.  The assault will be led by the GTD Bastion and the PVD Pinnacle, the finest ships in the Terran and Vasudan fleets."

3212, "On the Vanguard

Intelligence believes the Shivans have enough supplies and warships in Ross 128 to mount a significant defense.  Special Ops has been tasked with doing whatever it can to reduce the amount of resistance our fleets will encounter as they scour the system.

Our operations will be divided into two phases.  In the first phase, our squadrons will perform a reconnaissance-in-force of the system to determine the optimum allied attack strategy.  In the second phase, after the invasion begins, our squadrons will conduct strategic assaults against key Shivan positions.

We will be deploying all available wings on continuous rotation, so when you leave here, report to your squadron leaders for immediate mission briefings.  The Krios itself will remain standing by in a hidden location should problems arise during the invasion."

Research and Development has made available two new weapons to assist our forces in the invasion.

A variant of the Synaptic Bomb, GTI's cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against groups or wings of enemy ships.  Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a field of high-intensity explosive charges, making the Cluster Bomb most effective against fighter formations and freighters.  The Cluster Bomb has a large blast radius and can destroy your fighter if detonated at close range."

The EMP Missile has just completed field testing, and R&D's scientists are conducting a final evaluation of its design.  The missile is designed to produce a large electromagnetic pulse that scrambles sensors, communications, and navigation systems, crippling all small craft caught in the blast radius.

We are expecting a shipment of the missiles from the Repulse shortly and anticipate the weapon will be available for use when you return from your next series of missions."

3215, "In preparation for the main GTA thrust into Ross 128, our squadron is being dispatched to scout out the area.  Your assignment is to scan a suspected nexus of Shivan activity near the site of the original attack on Outpost Riviera.  Because our communications network in Ross 128 was destroyed when the Shivans first attacked, you will be out of contact with Command for the duration of this mission."

Expect to encounter the standard complement of freighters, transports, and fighters.  Scan all warships in the area as well as any debris that you find.  If you get the opportunity, scan the cargo in the area as well."

3217, "The GTI places a high priority on this operation, pilots.  It is preferable to gather a small amount of data and return safely than to gather too much information and fail to make it out alive.  We need whatever you can give us, no matter how insignificant it may seem.  Dismissed."

3218, "You failed to gather any worthwhile data on this sortie, pilot.  Without scans of both cruisers, the GTI cannot form any reasonable theory as to what happened during your mission.  The GTA will now be at a strategic disadvantage when it begins its invasion.  Dismissed!"

3219, "Scanning both cruisers isn't hard.  Just order all your wingmen to protect you and get in and out quick.

Scanning the transport and cargo is a little more difficult.  Get the transport as soon as you arrive, then order your wingmen to destroy the freighters so you can scan the cargo in relative peace.  Scan the cruisers last -- they aren't going anywhere."

3220, "This mission was a surprise for both of us, pilot.  Thanks to your scans, we have verified that the cruisers you encountered are GTI ships, originally registered as GTC Odin and GTC Thor.  Official records, however, show that these cruisers were destroyed in two separate engagements at the beginning of the Great War.  The fact that these ships were present in a highly sensitive sector of Shivan-controlled space at the same time as your deployment is more than a little suspicious.  We can only assume that this operation was carried out by a rogue element of the GTI."

3221, "Thanks to your scan of the Shivan transport, Intelligence may soon be able to determine the motivation and intent of the rogue operation.  We are already preparing a preliminary report to deliver to Terran Command.  Excellent work."

But to completely secure Ross 128, we must decapitate the Shivan infrastructure.  Intelligence believes the source of command for the Shivans in this sector to be the $h SD $h Archon, a Demon-class destroyer.  This ship will be the target of our next operation."

This development has grave implications for the future of the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  Terran Command has already been notified of our situation and will be updated as we debrief the survivors of the Krios.  I will address the crew of the Soyakaze tomorrow with our findings.

Victory

At 0525 hours this morning, GTA High Command declared a decisive victory over the Shivans in Ross 128 and Ikeya.  The species which annihilated the Ancients, which devastated Vasuda Prime, which nearly succeeded in driving mankind to extinction, has been defeated.  Recon units have found no trace of any remaining Shivan activity. 

With the Shivans gone, we should be able to start rebuilding our shattered systems and working on forging a lasting alliance with the Vasudans.  But there has been a terrible new development."

3346, "Ambush

While allied forces throughout Ross 128 engaged the Shivans, fighters and bombers launched from the GTD Repulse secretly attacked, disabled, and destroyed the Krios.  Only through the intervention of the Soyakaze were the survivors recovered.  We believe the Krios was destroyed to cover up information it had gathered about rogue activity in the Research and Development branch of GTI.

Once we had contacted GTA High Command, the Repulse and the R&D fleet immediately sprang into action, pulling out of Ross 128 and heading to Delta Serpentis.  Command has authorized all GTA units to consider these forces hostile, and to capture or destroy them at any opportunity.

Our agents have pieced together the events leading up to the Krios's destruction by analyzing the evidence salvaged from her.  A summary of the report follows."

3347, "Evidence

The Krios's interrogations of the Einstein's survivors suggest that Research and Development knew about the existence of the Shivans even before their initial appearance at Ross 128.  Several science vessels, including the Einstein, were assigned to secretly study this new species and its technology.  We believe the Einstein was deployed to Ross 128 and then reported destroyed so that the ship could continue its research operations without fear of outside supervision.

While R&D was instrumental in enabling the GTA and PVE fleets to quickly close the technological gap on the Shivans during the Great War, events strongly suggested that the Repulse and its fleet were keeping their most significant discoveries to themselves.  Based on the Einstein's appearance at the Vasudan research site in Deneb, Admiral Scott theorized that there could be an unknown number of ghost R&D ships conducting research unaccountable to the rest of the GTA.  This theory was given further support when pilots from the Krios blundered upon a secret recovery operation in Ross 128 and came under fire from rogue ships."

3348, "Betrayal

With the Krios slowly assembling evidence, the rogue elements grew in increasing danger of being exposed.  The Repulse sought to destroy this information before it reached critical mass and soon found the perfect opportunity.

With the Krios's fighter wings and support craft engaging the Shivans in Ross 128, the destroyer was left virtually undefended.  The rebels launched bombers against the Krios while sanitizing several SpecOps operations and jamming the transmissions of others under the guise of monitoring scientific data.  Only the pilots attacking the SD Archon returned early enough to witness the destruction of the Krios, and it was only because of their quick thinking that we were able to recover enough evidence to implicate Research and Development.  We have taken care to spread that information far enough that it can no longer be covered up.  The silent threat has been forced into the open."

3349, "Rebellion

We do not yet know the full extent of the insurrection, nor the rebels' motives or objectives.  Unfortunately, our maneuvers against the Shivans have left our fleets at serious risk of guerilla attacks from within.  While the GTA consolidates its forces, the Soyakaze has been tasked with gathering all the data we can about the enemy's objectives.  We cannot allow them the element of surprise. 

Report for mission briefings immediately."

3350, "At ease, pilots, and welcome to the 82nd Nighthawks.  I understand you're still a little shaken up after the destruction of the $f Krios, but rest assured -- the $h R&D rebels will get what's coming to them, sooner or later.  $f Terran $f Command and the officers of the $f Soyakaze are still analyzing data regarding the $h R&D insurrection and preparing a counterattack.  You'll be fully briefed when the time comes."

3351, "A situation is developing in $b Delta $b Serpentis.  Slipping behind our rear defenses, the $h Repulse launched a surprise attack against the diplomatic installations orbiting Delta Serpentis IV.  $f Terran and $f Vasudan forces responded quickly, but by the time they arrived, the orbital annex of the Vasudan Embassy had been wiped out.

The loss of life was less than would be expected from such an attack, but our communications with the Vasudan government have been thrown into disarray.  Needless to say, the incident has not improved Terran-Vasudan relations either."

3352, "Although the $h Repulse has since gone into hiding, the GTA isn't taking any chances.  The survivors of the attack are currently being relocated to fortified positions within the Terran-Vasudan fleet.  Diplomats, officers, and supply convoys are currently en route to a secure rendezvous point within the Delta Serpentis system, where they will be joined by the $f GTC $f Challenger and the $f PVC $f Bastet."

3353, "Unfortunately, $h R&D has access to our fleet communications network, so it is quite likely that the convoys will fall under attack.  You must defend the convoys until the Challenger and Bastet arrive.  Once the cruisers have relieved you, you may return to the $f Soyakaze.

Do not fail, pilots.  Dismissed."

3354, "Your primary objective was to defend the convoys against rebel attack, and you failed.  Hundreds of innocent lives were lost due to your incompetent performance.  Worse, Terran relations with the Vasudan government may have been damaged beyond repair.

You and your wing are grounded pending a formal inquiry into these events.  As wing leader, you will be court-martialed and charged with willful negligence of duty.  Frankly, you'll be lucky to get a dishonorable discharge."

3355, "Pay particular attention to Bragi, Roskva and Buri wings.  Be careful not to get distracted by dogfighting."

3356, "Good job, Alpha.  Thanks to you, the majority of the survivors were successfully evacuated.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3357, "Your protection of the freighters ensured that the refugees were well-supplied when they arrived at their shelter.  Well done."

3358, "Excellent work, Alpha.  Through your efforts, every single ship that was in your care made it to safe havens in Delta Serpentis.  They have been placed under allied protection, and the GTA is now working to restore ordered communication with the PVE."

3359, "Alpha 4 exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer of the GTA, and has been disciplined accordingly.  Let me remind you that all pilots have a responsibility to adhere to the highest standards of behavior, especially in their interactions with Vasudans.

With the repositioning of the GTA and PVE fleets in Delta Serpentis, the way is clear for our forces to begin the counterattack.  The next briefing will be at 1400 hours this afternoon.  Don't be late."

3383, "Yeah, like spying on us.  If you ask me, we should never have let them into Delta Serpentis."

3384, "I didn't ask you, and shut up.  They can hear you."

3385, "I don't care if they can.  They can't do anything on their own, that's why they came running to us as soon as the Shivans attacked.  That's why they need us to guard every single one of their stupid convoys!"

3386, "You have a loud mouth, Terran.  If you knew the truth you would not say such things."

3391, "The $h Research $h and $h Development branch of GTI has now staged an all-out open rebellion against the $f GTA.  Terran Command reports that all $h R&D ships are pulling out of allied operations and regrouping in $b Delta $b Serpentis and $b Beta $b Aquilae.

We suspect that the rebels are setting up rallying points throughout these systems, but they have proven quite adept at evading our efforts to track them down."

3392, "Fortunately, the $f Intelligence branch of GTI employs the most skilled reconnaissance and espionage operatives in the entire GTA.  Scouts from the $f Soyakaze have located a major rallying point in a remote corner of $b Delta $b Serpentis, guarded by none other than the $h Repulse herself.

Command has ordered us to capture the Repulse to determine the full extent of the insurrection.  The operation will proceed as follows."

3393, "A small strike force will arrive to confront the $h Repulse directly and draw its attention.  Meanwhile, $f Alpha wing will arrive on the far side of the engagement zone and attempt to slip in undetected.  The strike force will attempt to distract the Repulse long enough for you to disable and disarm it.  Transports will then arrive to board and capture the ship."

3394, "In addition to the $h Repulse, reconnaissance reports several freighters, three cruisers, and a large drydock of unknown configuration.  The drydock is unarmed and should pose no threat, but the other ships must be destroyed.  Additional units will be deployed to neutralize these threats, but you may be required to assist them once your have completed your objectives.  Vasudan forces will blockade the jump nodes to $b Beta $b Aquilae and $b Ross $b 128 to prevent any ships from escaping."

3395, "Exercise care during this mission, pilots.  The $h Repulse is commanded by $h Admiral $h Marcus $h Glaive, the highest-ranking field officer in $h R&D.  You can be sure that he will deploy his most capable forces, including his $b Loki-class stealth fighters, to defend his position.

Although our engineers are searching for a weakness in the Loki's stealth technology, their efforts have so far proven unsuccessful.  Regardless of the situation, you must do everything in your power to ensure that this mission succeeds.  The security of the GTA may depend on it."

3396, "Excellent work, pilots.  Our forces executed a clean sweep of the battle area.  Despite heavy resistance, we managed to capture the Repulse and destroy its cruiser escort.  The Vasudans report that all ships attempting to escape the system were neutralized by the blockades.

Unfortunately, we were unable to capture Admiral Glaive himself.  While you were distracted by transport Omega, a single Hermes escape pod left the Repulse's hangar and jumped to an unknown location.  Attempts to track the pod have so far proven unsuccessful.  However, Intelligence believes the interrogation of the Repulse's crew will provide us with sufficient information to plan our next move."

3397, "At present, we have determined that the Repulse was not rendezvousing at a rallying point, as we had initially assumed, but rather guarding a shipyard in the process of being evacuated.  Freighters had been moving supplies out of the area for several days, and the drydock was being rigged to self-destruct.

The drydock itself is something of an enigma.  Although it is constructed of standard Polaris modules, no designs exist for a configuration of this size and scope.  Scans indicate that the drydock was recently occupied by a large vessel, but all maintenance and repair records have been erased.

Quite what this means at this point is unknown, but Command has urged us to continue our investigation with caution."

3398, "You and your squadron destroyed the Repulse, despite specific orders to preserve it for capture.

This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  Although we have removed the rebel leadership, guerrilla forces continue to harass our ships and attack our convoys throughout Delta Serpentis and Beta Aquilae.  Tracking down these forces will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had our operation succeeded.

Your squadron is being removed from active duty until further notice.  Dismissed."

3399, "Don't destroy the Repulse.  Use Stilettos instead of Tsunamis, and pay attention to your wingmen."

3401, "You and your squadron failed to intercept Omega before it could repair the Repulse."

3402, "This failure has cost us our best opportunity to determine the strength, scope, and purpose of the rebellion.  We will have to attempt the operation a second time, but the Repulse is now fully aware of our plans and will undoubtedly have called for reinforcements.  We have no choice but to attempt a direct frontal assault, one which will cost us time, manpower, and lives that could have been saved had this operation succeeded the first time.

Origin of the Rebellion

With the material and information obtained from the capture of the Repulse, our counterintelligence agents have finally determined the origin and extent of the rebellion.  The discovery is deeply troubling.  Rogue activity within the GTI is not confined to the Research and Development branch, but involves officers in the highest echelon of the intelligence directorate.

Effective immediately, the GTA has terminated all support of GTI operations and declared an open state of war against the organization.  All forces loyal to the GTA, including the Soyakaze and the remnants of the Intelligence and Special Ops fleets, have been reintegrated into the main GTA battlegroup."

3518, "The GTI

Because of the technology and sensitive information within its grasp, the GTI poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the GTA, the PVE, and all allied worlds.  GTI's assets include, in addition to the ship and weapon prototypes developed by R&D, the top military scientists and strategic planners in the GTA.  They are not to be underestimated.

Against the GTI, our most effective weapon will be the numerical superiority of the combined GTA and PVE fleets.  Our actions must be swift and decisive."

3519, "New Developments

Our tactical situation will be greatly improved by the latest discovery from the Soyakaze's personnel.  Analysis of the GTF Loki has enabled our engineers to identify a design flaw in the Loki's structural composition.  This flaw renders the Loki's stealth technology effectively useless, as a simple reconfiguration of sensor parameters allows the Loki to be targeted by any of our ships.  All sensor systems in the GTA and PVE fleets have been upgraded with this new information."

3520, "Our Mission

Command has disclosed the location of the GTI's base of operations: the Jotunheim installation in the Beta Aquilae system.  The existence and location of this installation were, until now, classified at the highest level.  Our analysts believe that the majority of the rebel leadership and infrastructure are concentrated at this base.

If we are to have any chance of stopping the GTI, Jotunheim must be destroyed.  The GTA will launch an immediate, all-out offensive to take out the installation and its surrounding defenses.  Report to your wing stations for your specific briefings."

3521, "The $f Soyakaze has been ordered to destroy the $h Jotunheim, GTI's base of operations in $b Beta $b Aquilae.  GTI conducts their most secret operations, including xenobiological research and engineering, at this facility.  We believe the GTI has been studying Shivan technology and physiology here since first contact."

3522, "This operation will be performed in conjunction with the $f GTD $f Intrepid and the $f PVD $f Vanguard.  While the Terran and Vasudan fleets engage enemy targets throughout Beta Aquilae, our pilots will conduct a strike against Jotunheim itself.  A massive, coordinated assault on several fronts should overwhelm the GTI forces in this system and significantly improve our odds against the installation."

3523, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least six full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3524, "Our assault on Jotunheim will proceed in two phases.  In the first phase, $f Alpha and $f Beta will engage and destroy the installation's fighter complement.  Command estimates that Jotunheim will be able to deploy at least four full wings, so their defensive screen must be neutralized before our bombers arrive."

3525, "In the second phase, $f Zeta and $f Omicron will jump in and attack the installation's cruiser fortifications.  Once the cruisers are down, they will target and destroy the Jotunheim.  Alpha and Beta will remain on station to provide cover."

3526, "Because of the shortage of bombers on board the Soyakaze, Zeta and Omicron wings will be supplied by the Intrepid and the Vanguard respectively.  These pilots are veterans of the Great War with the Shivans and the fourteen-year war between our species, and have already seen action against the GTI on several fronts.  They are more than qualified to assist you on this mission."

3527, "If you need additional fighter support during any part of the mission, $f Gamma wing will be available as reinforcement.  Command will also deploy $f Delta and $f Epsilon, at their discretion, if the need arises."

3528, "We have only a limited tactical profile of the installation, so be prepared to engage exotic prototypes with unknown capabilities.  You are authorized to destroy any GTI vessel that interferes with your mission objectives.  However, your primary objective is to eliminate the Jotunheim.  All other targets are secondary.

Good luck, pilots."

3529, "Jotunheim has been destroyed, and with it, most of the GTI's weapon prototypes and technological research.  Unfortunately, our attempt to decapitate the GTI leadership failed, as some of the officers aboard the installation were able to escape its destruction and evade capture.  Worse, the insurgents have a new superweapon at their disposal.  The vessel that retrieved the Jotunheim's escape pods is a juggernaut of incredible proportions, capable of annihilating one of our cruisers in a single shot.  Firepower of this magnitude has heretofore been seen only on the SD Lucifer.

Reconnaissance wings have already been scrambled to track and identify this new class of ship.  Admiral Tess has informed me that our squadron may be called up to attack the superdestroyer at any time.  Dismissed."

The GTA and PVE have been plunged into chaos by the appearance of the GTI's latest superweapon.  The unthinkable has happened.

Preliminary scans indicate that it is a fusion of Terran and Shivan technologies unlike anything in our arsenal."

3574, "The Hades

We now know that this vessel, designated the Hades, is the attacker that crippled the PVD Hope and destroyed the Vasudan blockade at the Beta Aquilae node.  The Hades has since gone on to obliterate several allied strongholds throughout Beta Aquilae and Vega.

Terran and Vasudan forces are scrambling to develop a strategy to counter this new threat.  All pilots have been placed on ten-minute alert."

Unfortunately, we have no conclusive intelligence on the strength of $h GTI forces in this system.

3579, "It is unfortunate that you fell victim to the same tactic we used against the Vasudans only four years ago.  The Karnak-class installation's main weakness, as exploited by the GTA in Operation Cardinal Spear, is standard material in any League of Defense flight school curriculum.  Were you asleep in your military history class, pilot?

Whether you were caught off guard or simply failed to intercept the bomber in time is not the issue.  Command issued you a direct order, and you were unable to react with the speed and precision that the situation required.  In this present conflict, we cannot afford the risk that one of our top pilots will fail to respond at a critical moment.

I regret to inform you that Command is pulling you from active duty until we have the rebellion under control.  Dismissed."

We are also impressed that you were able to defeat the GTI's surprise attack against the Egyptos's reactor.  Your quick thinking and prompt response helped buy precious time for the survivors to escape the GTI's attack.  Well done."

3583, "We are disappointed that you were unable to save the PVC Hathor from the GTI assault.  In the face of today's events, even a few hundred additional survivors would have boosted morale."

3637, "$f Alpha $f 1, you have been selected to fly reconnaissance against the Hades.  Command has requested data regarding the $b communications, $b sensors, $b weapons, and $b navigation subsystems of the warship.  Information on the $b fighterbay and $b engine subsystems would also be valuable, but they are not as critical."

This will prevent the Hades's computers from acquiring target lock on the vessel, and the Herschel's small size should make manual targeting nearly impossible.  If we're lucky, the gunners on the Hades won't bother with her."

The Hades survived both the collision with and the explosion of a fully-armed Typhon-class destroyer.  The crew of the PVD Hope sacrificed their lives and their ship in a valiant attempt to bring victory to the GTA and PVE.  Though they were unsuccessful, they will be remembered with honor.

Unfortunately, Command must still deal with the consequences of the failed strike.  Although the Hope had unloaded her pilots and non-essential personnel before moving against the Hades, we have lost a well-trained and highly skilled command crew.  With our weakened fleets dispersed over several systems to contain the rebellion, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we will not be able to marshal sufficient forces quickly enough to confront the Hades.  We have no choice but to attack with what we have.  Command hopes that between the intelligence acquired from the Repulse and the scan data obtained from our reconnaissance, we should be able to find a weakness in the Hades before it reaches its destination."

3642, "However, you failed to scan the required subsystems on the Hades, forcing us to depend on the long-range sensor data transmitted by the Herschel.  Without the tactical intelligence we had hoped to obtain, our analysts will lack the information they need to plan an effective counterattack.

You were selected for this mission based on your impressive record of successful reconnaissance missions, and Command is extremely disappointed in your failure to live up to your reputation.  Perhaps your abilities are better demonstrated in standard assault and defense missions rather than situations requiring quick thinking and tactical improvisation.

Admiral Tess has approved your transfer back to the GTD Intrepid.  The containment effort will benefit greatly from someone with your piloting skill, but for our attack against the Hades we need pilots who excel in all areas of combat engagement.  The Soyakaze will jump to Deneb in six hours, so you have until then to collect your belongings.  Your transport will be waiting in the hangar."

3643, "Take out the first few fighters immediately, and then scan a subsystem or two in the interval between waves.  If you keep doing this, you should be able to get at least three subsystems.  Make sure you scan the communications, sensors, weapons, and navigation subsystems before any others."

3644, "Our reconnaissance was mostly successful, as you scanned three of the required four subsystems on the Hades.  Although we had hoped for a complete tactical profile of the juggernaut, your performance was satisfactory, considering the circumstances.  Our analysts will have a difficult time planning an effective counterattack, but the data you obtained should significantly improve our odds."

3645, "Our reconnaissance was a complete success, as you scanned all four of the required subsystems on the Hades.  Excellent work.  Our tacticians are analyzing the data you acquired as we speak, and we expect to receive a preliminary report in a few hours.  This information will significantly improve our odds in the upcoming counterattack."

3646, "Additionally, you were able to scan the Hades's fighterbay.  Intelligence has expressed great alarm at your findings, but their analysis remains classified for the time being."

3647, "You were also able to scan one of the Hades's engines.  Our engineers are incorporating your findings into their analysis as they search for a weakness in the juggernaut's defenses.  This information may explain why the Hades was temporarily disabled."

3648, "Admiral Tess has taken special note of your performance over the last few missions and has selected you to lead the attack against the Hades.  Your familiarity with the juggernaut's defenses will give us an extra edge in the upcoming battle, and your proven leadership and piloting skill are unequaled in this squadron.

Command has allowed our strategists and tacticians six hours to formulate a battle plan, after which the Soyakaze will jump to Deneb to pursue the Hades.  In the meantime, I suggest you get some rest.  Dismissed."

GTI Rebellion

The GTA, PVE, and GTI are now engaged in an all-out conflict that could determine the future of Terran-Vasudan history.  Although the bulk of the GTI fleet has been contained in Beta Aquilae and Vega, the GTI flagship Hades is still at large and must be stopped.  The Soyakaze is the only ship within range to intercept the juggernaut before she can carry out her ultimate objective.  Victory or defeat will be decided in the next few hours.

You are being informed on a need-to-know basis about the Hades project, and are hereby notified that all information regarding it is classified Level Omega.  Divulging this information, directly or indirectly, to any persons other than those specifically authorized by the Galactic Terran Alliance is a treasonous offense, punishable by death."

3694, "Project Hades

The GTD Hades was conceived and designed in 2324, when it became apparent that the Terran-Vasudan War would not be won decisively in a matter of months.  This superdestroyer would be nearly invulnerable to bomber, cruiser, and destroyer attacks, and would be able to mount full-scale planetary assaults unaided.  Construction began the following year, in the Delta Serpentis shipyards.

When the Shivans arrived in 2335, the Hades was nearing completion.  The GTI conducted extensive studies of the aliens, particularly of the Lucifer, and put the new developments to use in the Hades.  With their ultimate weapon now boasting Shivan beam weaponry and Terran-Shivan hybrid systems, GTI forces waited for the deployment order from GTA High Command.

But the order never came.  Unlike every other cease-fire over the course of the Terran-Vasudan War, this one held.  The GTA and PVE set aside their differences to counter the Shivan threat, and in the process developed a grudging respect for each other."

3695, "GTI's Objective

Galactic Terran Intelligence, however, could not easily discard the investment and momentum of ten years' worth of work on the Hades.  According to statements by captured operatives, the GTI concluded that the GTA had lost sight of its original goal and decided to take matters into its own hands.

The GTI appears to have been positioning itself to overthrow the GTA government, as soon as the Terrans had recovered enough from the Great War to stand on their own.  Once the Shivans were defeated, the GTI would dissolve the Terran-Vasudan treaty and strike the final blow against the PVE.  The Terran-Vasudan War would finally be won."

3696, "A Final Gambit

The exposure of the GTI conspiracy has prevented their plan from coming to fruition, but the GTI may yet succeed in their ultimate objective.  Our reconnaissance against the Hades has indicated that its engines are enhanced with Shivan components, which may enable the juggernaut to use jump nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels.  Command believes that, rather than pursuing a random course of destruction, the Hades is actually en route to Altair and Aldebaran via the Deneb-Altair phasing jump node.

This maneuver would effectively allow the Hades to slip behind Vasudan lines, beyond any possibility of interception by GTA or PVE forces.  The Deneb-Altair jump node is no longer stable enough for our ships to traverse, which means that any counterattack would have to go the long way around via Alpha Centauri.  By then, the Hades will have had more than enough time to devastate the Vasudan home systems unopposed."

3697, "Our Response

There are some within the GTA who favor the GTI in this conflict.  Indeed, many officers and pilots have defected to the GTI, and many others have argued that the Vasudans would behave the same as the GTI if they were in the same position.  I can only answer by saying that I believe this is the right thing to do, and I believe the Vasudans would defend us if the situation were reversed.

It may be difficult for each species to see past the horrors of the past fourteen years, but the Vasudans seem to be holding up their end of the bargain.  The PVE continued to work closely with the GTA in our campaign to track and destroy the Lucifer, even after the devastation of Vasuda Prime removed their main motivation for doing so.  And the GTA and PVE continue to share military resources and intelligence even today.  We should honor their continued support with our own.  History will determine whether we made the right choice in doing so."

3698, "The $h Hades has been tracked to an abandoned cargo depot in orbit around $b Deneb $b III.  This once-prosperous colony was utterly destroyed by the Shivans earlier this year, and the shattered remains of many warships drift nearby.  The Hades's engines are currently offline, and we believe she is repairing the damage sustained in the collision with the $f PVD $f Hope.  This may be our only chance to destroy the juggernaut before it reaches $b Altair."

3699, "The $f Soyakaze is making the subspace jump to $b Deneb as we speak.  Advance fighter wings will be launched immediately upon the Soyakaze's arrival in the system, and the Soyakaze herself will move into position to challenge the Hades directly as soon as her jump drives are recharged.  The Hades has five main beam cannons that must be destroyed for the Soyakaze to have a chance of victory."

3700, "$f Alpha wing will fly tactical assault, using $b Tsunami bombs to destroy the Hades's beam emplacements.  $f Beta wing will cover them.  When the Soyakaze arrives to confront the Hades, $f Delta and $f Epsilon wings will also be deployed."

3701, "We have a limited window of opportunity to destroy the Hades before it concludes its activity at the depot and leaves the system.  The capabilities of this warship are unthinkable, and in the hands of the GTI it is a terrible weapon.

The security of the Terran and Vasudan species is in your hands now, pilots.  You know the consequences of failure.  Good luck."

3702, "Congratulations, pilots!  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered.  Had we failed here, the GTI would be writing the history books."

3703, "Welcome to the GTD Intrepid, pilots.  The destruction of the GTD Soyakaze is a tragedy for everyone in the Alliance, especially for those of you so recently stationed on the GTD Krios.  Fortunately, the Soyakaze was not lost in vain.  The Hades has been destroyed and the GTI rebellion is no more.  All remaining GTI forces throughout Terran-Vasudan space have surrendered."

3704, "Members of the provisional GTA government have already begun the process of reconstruction in cooperation with our Vasudan allies.  It is ironic that, far from tearing our two species apart, this conflict has brought them closer together than ever before.  Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group, has expressed interest in personally meeting with the pilots who flew against the Hades -- a rare gesture on the part of a Vasudan."

3705, "Debris from the Hades is still raining down on Deneb III.  Due to the sensitive nature of the technology it contained, the planet will be quarantined until the wreckage can be disposed of.  Terran Command has classified all data regarding the technology used in this engagement, though we can probably expect to see these advances in future Terran and Vasudan warship designs."

3706, "We failed to stop the Hades before it could repair its engines, and the GTI superweapon successfully made the subspace jump to Altair.  It has only been a few short hours since the battle ended, but our worst fears have been confirmed.

We have already started to receive reports on the devastation being wrought in Altair and Aldebaran.  Hundreds of thousands of Vasudans are believed dead, and many of the PVN's highest-ranking officers have committed ritual suicide, including Admiral Amentep, commander of the PVD Guardian and the Vasudan 13th Battle Group.  Most alarmingly, Hammer of Light cells in Altair have begun to change their rhetoric, claiming that the prophesied Great Destroyers are not the Shivans after all, but the Terrans."

3707, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.  In our battle against the Hades, the odds were against us, and the sentiments of fourteen years are not easily pushed aside by the events of six months.  As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis.  In the face of overwhelming opposition from our former allies, Admiral Tess and the Soyakaze have surrendered."

3708, "Perhaps our victory was not meant to be.

As we speak, Terran ships across the GTA are defecting to the GTI in large numbers, and members-in-hiding of the intelligence directorate have emerged to seize power in Delta Serpentis."

3709, "Our failure has brought calamity to our ravaged systems.  Though the wars against the Vasudans and the Shivans are now over, we may have paid the price with our souls."

3736, "This is Admiral Tess of the GTD Soyakaze.  Greetings, Admiral.  I was not aware that the Guardian had been repaired yet."

3737, "Regrettably, it has not.  We are still in orbit around Cygnus Prime.  But let us dispense with protocol, for the time is short.  Am I correct in assuming that you have engaged the GTI destroyer Hades?"

3738, "Affirmative, Admiral.  Our bombers are attacking the Hades near Deneb III."

3739, "And so the circle completes itself.  Remarkable.  I wish to inform you, Admiral, that one of our fighter squadrons just repelled a Hammer of Light ambush against the GTC Orff and two bomber wings."

3740, "These craft had entered the Deneb system in an attempt to engage the Hades, but were apparently provided incorrect information by a traitor sympathetic to the GTI.  If you will transmit your coordinates, I will redeploy the Orff and its wings to your location."

3741, "Transmitting now.  Admiral Amentep, you have our sincerest gratitude."

3742, "The gratitude is ours, but you may repay us by recounting the story of your victory over the GTI.  Sa Terra, vessels of the GTA.  Admiral Amentep out."

3743, "GTC Orff now on station.  We are targeting the Hades."

3744, "Holy crap, the Orff is down!  It never even had a chance!"

3745, "The Orff will be avenged today, pilot, as will every other victim of the GTI.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3746, "It's good to see you again, Orff.  I really like your new friends."

3747, "Iota 1 here.  If you can keep those fighters off us, pilots, we'll take down that juggernaut faster than you can blink."

3748, "This is Pi 1.  The honor of destroying the Hades must fall to the GTA, but the warriors of the PVN will do whatever we can to assist."

3749, "Oh, hell... Command, the Hades is moving!"

3750, "The Hades appears to have channelled all of its remaining power into its main engines.  Pilots, you must either disable or destroy the Hades before it can escape.  Move it!"

3751, "The Hades is jumping out!"

3752, "Damn it, pilots! ... All right, we're attempting to track the Hades through subspace.  Return to base quickly and we might be able to redeploy you to its new location."

3753, "How are we ever going to kill this thing?  It's twice as big as an Orion and probably eight times as strong!"

3754, "Just keep fighting.  This is the same as every other assault mission you've been on, it's just going to take longer.  Stay focused.  The Hades isn't going anywhere."

3755, "We're lucky the Hope managed to hit the engine array.  The more strain we can put on this ship, the better.  I'm guessing those Terran-Shivan integrated systems aren't entirely stable."

3756, "I don't believe this.  We're actually winning!"

3757, "Don't let your guard down, kid.  The battle's not over yet."
