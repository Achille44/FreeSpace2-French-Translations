MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "Lieutenant Ross. We haven't met. Let's keep it that way. Commonwealth HIGHCOM sends its regards." 7583 "08a-01"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "I work with Alban Naval Intelligence. I've been chasing a Fed weapons research project that ANI got wind of a few months back. It looks like the Combine have managed to coopt it for themselves." 7584 "08a-02"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "We're also monitoring the situation on the Morik war front. It looks like the entire Federation defense line is collapsing." 7585 "08a-03"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "Someone in Federation Defense Intelligence buggered up, hard. The Combine used FDI's research data to build their superweapon, and the Feds just let it happen." 7586 "08a-04"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "I'm talking about Solaris, and that data package you lot picked up in Mira. We suspect it goes back all the way to the beginning of the Elam war. The Federation weren't supporting the Republic out of friendship." 7587 "08a-05"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "The Federation occupied the Mira system months ago, and that 'Combine' base you attacked, was actually FDI's." 7588 "08a-06"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "The research base was destroyed before we could move in and salvage the data. However, it seems we got lucky." 7589 "08a-07"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "That intel you got from Juliet is the break we needed. I'm putting together a plan to get a copy of the data to ANI." 7590 "08a-08"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "Thanks to Lancaster's terrible operation security, you and McKearney are in the perfect position to help us crack Solaris." 7591 "08a-09"
MSGXSTR "Red Abbey" 7582 "As loyal subjects of the King, Crown High Command presumes your cooperation in this matter. Let's not ruin a good thing, shall we?" 7592 "08a-10"
