XSTR("The Miranda Accord of 2436 was signed into effect amongst the ashes of the Great War. The war was remarkable in the excesses of the tactics and weapons used, harkening back to the unrestrained industrial warfare of centuries ago. Unrestricted nuclear orbital bombardment had left several planets ecologically devastated, including Earth. By the time of ceasefire, billions of souls had perished. Humanity would not survive another such war.

A conference attended by representatives of every sovereign star nation set into motion a solemn, binding vow - never again will such destruction visit humanity's homes among the stars.

In addition to finalising the terms of armistice, a major tenet of the treaty was drafted to prevent a repeat of this tragedy by restricting the storage and deployment of spaceborne nuclear weapons to capital ships. Further treaty restrictions to nuclear proliferation limited capital ships to the three recognised Great Powers: the Atlantean Federation, Sinarus Combine and Alban Commonwealth. If any nation violated these restrictions, an automatic declaration of war by the three Great Powers would be enacted to enforce the treaty.

The galactic balance of power to enforce this treaty has been upended by the explosive expansion of the Atlantean Federation Navy, which in numbers and tonnage is double the combined strength of the Commonwealth and Combine navies. Dissenting voices questioning the relevance of the Miranda Accord have been increasing in volume, with many political commentators suggesting the need of a new Accord to limit naval construction.", 2548)

XSTR("'Peace Through Strength'

The Atlantean Federation is the largest and most politically dominant of the Terran powers. Founded on liberal democratic values and forged in the aftermath of the Great War, the Federation sees itself as the vanguard of civilization - a stabilising force in an otherwise volatile galaxy. Its federal government, elected by a wide-ranging electorate, functions in concert with a powerful defense establishment and a sprawling network of corporate stakeholders. The Federation's institutions are robust, its cultural exports omnipresent, and its fleet unmatched in size.

The Federation operates not only as a military bloc but also as a cultural and economic juggernaut. Member systems enjoy internal autonomy, but defense, foreign affairs, and trade are centralized under a strong executive. Federation citizens are raised in a civic culture that combines frontier optimism with post-industrial privilege. Critics argue this fosters complacency and hubris; supporters claim it's the reason the Federation endures.

Its foreign policy is one of preemptive engagement and soft power projection. Officially, it promotes stability, free markets, and democratic values. In practice, it often intervenes to secure trade corridors, install 'friendly' regimes, or counter threats from autocratic rivals. Peacekeeping deployments and military aid are routine, as are covert operations in systems deemed strategically fragile. Its navy is an enormous, carrier-led force designed for rapid response and long-range power projection.

Beneath the noble rhetoric lies a hard truth: the Federation doesn't just lead the galactic order - it defines it. Whether viewed as a benevolent hegemon or a veiled empire, the Federation's influence is everywhere, and its reach seldom questioned.", 2550)

XSTR("'One People. One Future.'

The Sinarus Combine is a technocratic autocracy built on the ruins of the old Sol Combine, forged in the fire of collapse and civil war. Where the Federation champions liberty and identity, the Combine champions discipline, sacrifice, and the rule of systems. It presents itself as a society free from the chaos of populism, where the state ensures prosperity through centralized planning, social engineering, and unflinching authority. To Combine leadership, authoritarianism is not an evil - it's the only thing that works.

The Combine is governed by a collection of Directorates and Ministries under the oversight of the Archon, with all activity aligned toward a central Strategic Doctrine. Citizens are assigned roles based on aptitude metrics and are subject to rigorous social credit systems that measure productivity, loyalty, and 'civic resilience.' Surveillance is ubiquitous but precise. Rather than brute repression, the Combine relies on predictive analytics and social conditioning to maintain internal cohesion.

Externally, the Combine projects strength through a doctrine of calculated deterrence. Its navy is mobile, hard-hitting, and optimized for pre-emptive strikes - especially in disputed border zones. The Combine seeks to reclaim territories it considers historically or strategically vital, and is unafraid to use economic blackmail or covert destabilization to achieve its aims. Unlike the Federation, it does not dress its actions in moral language. Efficiency is justification enough.

Critics describe the Combine as dystopian; its citizens, when asked, call it safe. To live in the Combine is to live under scrutiny, but with guarantees: shelter, education, order. The state may be intrusive, but it never forgets you exist.", 2552)

The Alban Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy that blends ceremonial tradition with hard-edged strategic clarity. Though smaller in territory and military strength than its rival Great Powers, it plays an outsized role in interstellar politics through cultural prestige, naval quality, and diplomatic finesse. Ruled by King Edward Wynson, a widely respected sovereign believed by many to possess a gift for political foresight, the Commonwealth positions itself as a principled middle path between autocracy and populism.

The Commonwealth's internal structure is federal but loyal to the Crown. Member worlds are granted local autonomy within a shared legal and military framework, anchored by a deeply ingrained sense of civic honour. The upper echelons of society include hereditary nobles, knighted professionals, and elected representatives, all bound by a shared ethic of service. In the Commonwealth, one's title is earned by action more than birth.

The Alban Crown Navy is renowned for its professionalism, discipline, and operational efficiency. It favours cruiser-led task groups and long-range strike platforms, prioritising quality over volume. Though often outnumbered, Commonwealth fleets routinely outperform expectations, especially in coalition environments. Commonwealth officers are in high demand as trainers, advisers, and diplomats.

On the galactic stage, the Commonwealth is a quiet kingmaker. It builds coalitions, brokers treaties, and offers sanctuary to reformers and dissidents from more extreme regimes. While not as aggressive as the Federation or as controlling as the Combine, it is no less ambitious. Its diplomacy is deliberate, its neutrality strategic, and its restraint a form of power in its own right.", 2554)

The Republique Jacobine is an authoritarian parliamentary republic forged in revolution and sustained by national myth. To its citizens, it is the truest expression of people's sovereignty: a nation where liberty is preserved not through compromise, but through vigilant civic engagement, ideological clarity, and unwavering sacrifice. Governed by the General Assembly and led by the Citizen-President, the Republique practices an assertive, rationalised form of governance where public virtue is enforced, not assumed.

Its institutions operate under the supervision of the Bureau of Virtue, a powerful civic authority responsible for ideological coherence and social conduct. Political parties exist, but only within the framework of the revolutionary consensus. Education, media, and military training are geared toward cultivating the citoyen eclaire: the enlightened citizen. In the Republique, patriotism is a moral duty, and revolution is a continuous process.

The La Marina is compact, modern, and ideologically hardened. It is not just a fighting force but an instrument of republican idealism, often deployed in support of democratic uprisings, anti-monarchist insurgencies, and anti-corporate revolts. Jacobine officers are both soldiers and commissars, trained in both naval tactics and revolutionary philosophy.

To foreign observers, the Republique is paradoxical: a state that preaches liberty while surveilling its citizens, that seeks peace through continual struggle. But to its people, this tension is the Republic's greatest strength. It is not a utopia; it is a crucible in which civic virtue is tested and refined.

XSTR("'Only in duty do we endure'

The Greater Yamatan Union is a techno-feudal empire, rigidly hierarchical and deeply spiritual, where technology serves not to liberate the individual but to perfect their role in society. Governed by the Shogunate under the rule of the High Kensei, the Union merges ancient Yamatan warrior traditions with advanced neural augmentation and biotechnological modification. Every citizen is born into a caste, every action is ritualised, and every war is sacred.

Citizens are stratified by service and obedience. Higher castes receive elite education and enhancements; lower castes perform logistical, agricultural, or menial duties, often in lifelong devotion to their local daimyo. While the system appears oppressive, many citizens embrace it - believing that honour, not freedom, is the highest human value. Education reinforces this through philosophical teachings, martial training, and programmed reverence for the Union's hierarchy.

The Yamatan Navy is compact, elite, and heavily reliant on cybernetic command networks and autonomous squadrons. Each fleet operates as a self-contained shrine of battle - officers duel over disputed targeting solutions, and victory is not merely measured in territory gained but in ritual fulfilment. While the Union avoids foreign entanglements, it reacts with overwhelming force to threats or slights against its honour.

Externally, the Union is regarded as both enigmatic and formidable. Its refusal to modernise diplomatically frustrates its neighbours, but its cultural resilience and strategic discipline make it a long-term player few dare provoke.", 2560)

A constitutional empire that shares space borders with both the Commonwealth and Combine spheres of influence, the Rheinische Kaiserreich is a proud and industrious state emerging from decades of postwar retrenchment. Once a formidable military power during the Great War, the Reich was left diminished by peace treaties, domestic fatigue, and the loss of key colonial holdings. Under the current Kaiserin, Marianne Therese von Hohenrath, the Reich has embarked on a carefully managed rearmament and industrial modernization campaign, seeking to reclaim strategic autonomy without provoking its more powerful neighbours.

Geopolitically wedged between two superpowers, the Reich has become adept at balancing diplomacy and deterrence. It shares cultural and political affinities with the Alban Commonwealth and maintains cordial, if cautious, relations with it. At the same time, it exports raw materials and heavy industrial goods to the Sinarus Combine, an arrangement viewed as pragmatic necessity rather than ideological alignment. Though its navy is a fraction of its former size, the Reich's forces are well-trained and increasingly well-equipped, favoring quality over quantity. The Kaiserin's government walks a deliberate middle path (neither fully aligned with the Commonwealth nor hostile to the Combine) hoping to preserve stability while rebuilding national strength.

A resplendent yet disciplined interstellar state, the Aryavartan Subah is a federation of hereditary provinces unified under the throne of the Padshah of Zahirabad. Inspired by the dynastic grandeur and layered administrative systems of Old Earth's Mughal legacy, the Subah blends pageantry with policy.

Although its military projection and political leverage remain modest compared to the Great Powers, the Subah has become an increasingly vital economic actor in the postwar order. A boom in trade and industrial output has fueled rapid modernisation, giving rise to what Subahi thinkers call the 'Second Radiance' - a period of renaissance marked by cultural revival and technological advancement.

The Subah's naval doctrine favours defensive sovereignty, with elegant warships prioritising ablative armour, point defense, and coordinated fighting withdrawal tactics. Though limited in size, the Subah's navy is tightly integrated into its bureaucratic caste system, with officers drawn from the Khilat Order: a hereditary class of warrior-administrators known for their ceremonial regalia and stoic discipline.

Diplomatically, the Aryavartan Subah practices 'Radiant Nonalignment.' It maintains warm trade relations with the Commonwealth and select Combine frontier prefectures, while cautiously navigating ideological distance from the Republique and maintaining neutrality in the Federation-Combine rivalry. While its forces rarely venture far beyond its borders, its diplomats, traders, and cultural envoys are increasingly influential across the Periphery and neutral corridors.

The Subah's strength lies not in force of arms, but in patience, wealth, and vision. Its citizens understand the Padshah's rule is not simply temporal but part of the cosmic balance. And in an age of fire and uncertainty, the Subah offers a rare constant: an empire that neither retreats into the past, nor rushes blindly into the void.", 2564)

Once envisioned as a federation of enlightened planetary governors and reformist trade lords, the Sulsian Hegemony has decayed into a fractured, cynical regime marred by institutional corruption, economic stagnation, and endemic exploitation. Though blessed with vast reserves of minerals, hydrocarbons, and industrial feedstock, the Hegemony suffers from mismanagement and internal rot. What began as a loose confederation of idealists has curdled into a predatory state propped up by debt, indenture, and fear.

At its core lies Seleste, the decadent and gleaming capital world, home to an opulent oligarchy that cloaks its extravagance in ceremonial hierarchy. While Seleste enjoys luxury and isolation, vast swathes of Sulsian space remain underdeveloped, lawless, and dominated by indentured labour systems. Entire generations toil in orbital refineries or planetary mines, legally bound by debt contracts and overseen by corporate enforcers or regional governors turned warlords.

The Sulsian navy, once a unifying symbol of planetary cooperation, is now a hollowed force - ill-equipped, undertrained, and often outgunned even by pirate fleets. Piracy is rampant, especially along the fringe worlds, where the navy often turns a blind eye in exchange for tribute or unofficial protection deals. Local authorities maintain fragmented control, and paramilitary groups like the Malikan People's Militia - a revolutionary, populist insurrection movement - routinely challenge the Hegemony’s grip on the outer provinces.

Despite its dysfunction, the Hegemony remains a critical economic partner to the Alban Commonwealth, exporting a glut of cheap raw materials in exchange for finished goods, medical supplies, and consumer technology. This trade imbalance has only deepened the dependency of the Sulsian economy on foreign markets. While Commonwealth officials publicly condemn Sulsian human rights abuses, corporate actors and trade ministries quietly benefit from the status quo, sustaining lucrative deals for rare earths, fuel stock, and industrial feed.

Diplomatically isolated and strategically weak, the Sulsian Hegemony endures through inertia, graft, and the convenience it provides to more powerful states. Its ruling class clings to ceremonial grandeur and the illusion of control, while its frontier burns and its people search for salvation - or revolution.", 2566)

The Malika People's Militia is a diffuse revolutionary movement composed of miners, defectors, ex-intelligence officers, trade unionists, and disaffected civilians. Originally formed in the wake of a collapsed corporate regime in the Malika Belt, the Militia has since metastasised into dozens of cells scattered across neglected frontier systems. Its structure is loose, its ideology inconsistent, but its message clear: resist the return of oligarchy, seize local autonomy, and dismantle the mechanisms of systemic exploitation.

Militia forces operate out of asteroid colonies, derelict mining platforms, and half-abandoned orbital rigs. While lightly armed and underfunded compared to the navies of major powers, their agility and local support make them a serious threat to colonial garrisons and mercenary fleets. They rely on salvaged equipment, decentralised encryption networks, and sympathetic merchants for supplies. Some factions dabble in piracy; others govern liberated territories with varying degrees of order and legitimacy.

External powers see the Militia as a useful pressure valve - or a dangerous destabiliser. Regardless of what they are called, the Militia endures - fighting, fragmenting, and reforming wherever the promise of freedom collides with the reality of control.", 2570)

XSTR("'All Stars Lead to the Promised Land'

The frontiers of Terran Space are a region of intense religious activity. The absence of established institutions and an overwhelmingly practical worldview in a hardscrabble existence divested traditional religious organisations of authority. Ad-hoc spirituality took hold in the region, democratising religion and legitimised individual spiritual expression. Hardship and strong community ties formed the basis of this egalitarian landscape.

The Children of Renewal are a pacifist spiritual movement with roots in frontier Christianity, neo-Mormon theology, and zen-like asceticism. Unlike most factions, they possess no standing army, no territorial ambitions, and no central command. Instead, they operate as a constellation of missionary fleets, humanitarian stations, and outreach settlements - bound together by faith in the coming 'Promised Land' and the belief that all souls, regardless of origin, are equal before the divine.

Children of Renewal vessels travel the edge of settled space, providing medical aid, repairs, and guidance to stranded travellers. They fund their operations through a combination of donations, patronage from wealthy Federation sympathisers, and communal labor. While non-proselytising in tone, they distribute devotional texts, perform religious rites, and offer spiritual counsel to those who seek it.

Many dismiss the Children as eccentric cultists, and their pacifism as naivety. Yet they are quietly respected across the frontier. In lawless systems, a Renewal station is often the only source of order, food, or medicine.

Their influence spreads not through conquest, but through quiet presence. They do not seek converts - they invite wanderers.", 2572)

By tunneling between two points in 3-dimensional space, a vessel could practically achieve faster-than-light travel without the deterministic complications of actual FTL travel. The first hyperspace drives were cumbersome devices employing vast amounts of energy to fold two points in space and establish a hyperspace tunnel between them.

A second revolution came about through the detection of 'highways' connecting various points in real-space. Not only was the energy requirement far lower to 'enter' and 'exit' hyperspace at these points, travel time was significantly shorter than by the previous method of hyperspace travel. With the discovery of these hyperspace lanes, Terran colonisation of the Orion Arm accelerated at an exponential level. Whilst it is universally accepted that the presence of these lanes has been a boon to our species, the origin of these lanes remains a mystery.
