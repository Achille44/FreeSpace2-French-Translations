+Type: XSTR("Cruiser", 6407)
+Tech Description: XSTR("Transjovian artillery beam cruiser.

The Dikastes is the most unique of the Transjovian warships fielded by the Earth Alliance to date.  The Dikastes is a sophisticated unit that specializes in long-range surgical strikes using its destroyer-grade spinal beam cannon.  Our analysts believe that Dikastes is in fact, a Soter or Proxenos mainframe reworked to house a massive reactor directly linked with with beam cannon and unique stabilizer device. Displaying obvious similarities to Apothess-class destroyers, Dikastes seems to be a result of reverse-engineered vasudan technology scanned during Alliance's siege on the Ishtar installation utilizing GVD Sebek. It remains unknown for us how TransJovians managed to reproduce it so fast, and significantly decrase size of the whole device. Dikastes is an extremely dangerous threat to Alliance vessels. Capable of bristling all of her firepower from 11,5 clicks, a wing of Dikastes cruisers is capable of neutralizing a destroyer-grade targer as efficiently as infamous, opening salvo of Lindos class destroyers and remain beyond range of any potential backlash fire. Despite being armed in decent point defence screen, main drawback of Dikastes is her vulnerability to fighter and bomber strikes. Focusing device is extremely large and produce enormous amount of radiation, so all of the components had to be installed outside the ship. Additionally such large beam weapon needs to radiate all the heat directly into space making it's core systems exposed. Those features should be compensated by GTVA's strike units. Without her main beam Dikastes is a minimal threat, but TjD seems to be very protective about warships of this class, and often deploying multiple wings of fighters to protect Dikastes class warships. Very few examples were ever encountered. This fact lead our analysts to conclusion, that Dikastes is a prototype warship deployed in limited numbers to evaluate both the ship and subspace focusing technology for beam weaponry. ", 6430)

During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper-hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of a fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and promptly dismissed.

The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Just over fifty years ago, the SD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN fleet that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work.

With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began.

The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over thirty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed.

We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come.", 6445)

+nocreate
$Alt Name: XSTR("GTI Veles", 6934)
+Type: XSTR("Destroyer", 6284)
+Tech Description: XSTR("In the earliest days of interstellar travel, trade between systems was relatively limited by the simple expense of access, both to orbital and super-orbital space and to intersystem jump technology. As technology matured, however, and access to space became cheaper, commercial activity and interstellar trade grew rapidly, particularly as colonisation efforts – and later the 14 Year War – saw demand boom. Soon, the requirements of the ballooning trade network threatened to overwhelm the early Endymion class space stations of the time.

The Alliance’s response was two-fold. The first was the acceleration of the design and deployment of the earliest Arcadia class Installations in order to reduce the burden on existing Endymions in the largest populated system. The second was the development of the Veles, a smaller station and supply depot that could serve in a number of roles as a resupply depot, cargo or passenger transfer station or deep space storage facility in populated systems. Some were further adapted to provide refuelling capabilities or for maintenance and repair of the vessels they serviced.

Unlike the larger, more generalist Arcadia, the Veles demonstrates an almost spartan dedication to its role. Where an Arcadia can accommodate thousands, a Veles has an active crew of only a few hundred, and a maximum capacity of under a thousand people. Where an Arcadia has a cavernous fighterbay and was armed to defend itself during wartime, the Veles was very lightly armed (or in many cases entirely unarmed) and used its various landing bays primarily for shuttles, transports and small freighters rather than fighters. Despite these apparent shortcomings, the Veles was considered highly successful in its role, and the simple, robust design rapidly spread across Sol and the newly colonised systems of the GTA.", 6935)
