MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5587 "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU" 5635

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "I got an urgent communication from Admiral Bertini's office. The old bulldog wants us flying alongside his flagship against the Malikans. He's got firm intel on Gadaria's location and he wants blood." 5904 "21a-01"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "The terrorist leader has been tracked to Jotram station, the logistical, military and spiritual heart of the Malika People's Militia. The place is a fortress, but Bertini wants us to crack it open." 5905 "21a-02"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "The Sulsians didn't say why Gadaria withdrew back home after spending months in the front lines, though I'd bet good money the inbound Commonwealth battle group's got something to do with it." 5906 "21a-03"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "It doesn't matter. The Sulsian navy has been crippled by months of Malikan hit and run attacks and most ships have been destroyed or are under repair. Admiral Bertini needs escort ships for the attack on Jotram Station." 5907 "21a-04"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "Bertini's primary objective is to locate Andri Gadaria and bring him to justice." 5908 "21a-05"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "Fringe law is relatively straightforward in this regard. Justice for the Sulsians means death, whether it's through a court-sentenced execution or missile warheads." 5909 "21a-06"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "I've accepted his contract. I didn't even negotiate a higher payment. If Bertini wants to send Gadaria to hell, I'm one hundred percent on board." 5910 "21a-07"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5670 "Bertini assures me the Protogeneia can eat the smaller Malikan ships for breakfast. What the battlecruiser can't do is counter small strike craft and missiles. We'll just have to do that for her." 5915 "21a-12"
