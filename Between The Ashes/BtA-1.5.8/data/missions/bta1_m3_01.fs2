$b Our $b situation

The loss of the $h Frontier and $h Cardinal puts us in the same situation we'd aimed to put $r Ozymandias in at $y Thanut$| . If the $f Intrepid makes her presence known anywhere in system, we invite an overpowering ambush that would likely prove decisive. The Intrepid will be running quiet until we're at least at RedStat 3. Fighter deployments will be kept to a minimum to reduce risk of $r Ozymandias tracing them back to our position.

The recent setbacks have pushed Command to begin a preliminary withdrawal from Antares. We have been ordered to support the relocation of strategic materials to $B Beta $B Aquilae to prevent their capture by the $r Hammer $r of $r Light$| .", 3680)

 XSTR("$b Open $b Rebellion

Command's decisions have been leaked to the media, and Antares is in uproar. A closed-door emergency session in New Shanghai on $y Gulnara was called three hours ago. Representatives from Antares' major colonies and space installations have convened to respond to the $b GTA's Antares policies. $W GRIFFIN reports security forces and GTA units not attached to the Intrepid's battlegroup are being loaded for bear. We believe hostile action from Gulnara's direction is imminent.

Militant elements of the $Y Antares $Y Federation party stipulate any $b GTA convoy attempting to ferry strategic assets extrasolar will be intercepted. Forward observers at $y Gulnara already recorded several squadrons of modern fighters, including Valkyries and Ulysses, launching from various orbitals. Recon has also confirmed the presence of $r TM $r Arothron beacons in the vicinity of the Beta Aquilae node. If you're not familiar with the design, you are advised to hit the Tech Room before launch.

My staff and I expect to outline our new strategy against the $r HoL within the next six hours. See you at the briefing.", 3681)
