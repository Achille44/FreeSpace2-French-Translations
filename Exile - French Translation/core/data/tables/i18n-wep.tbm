The most newest and most advanced version of the Prometheus cannon, the Locust was designed to confront heavily shielded EFN bombers attacking Vitalius-class frigates and Galahad-class destroyers.

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Polyhydra Antimatter Cannon

Derived straight from reverse-engineered Shivan technology less then a month after the execution of Operation Moyses, the Polyhydra is also based on a refined weapon dropped from the early ORS arsenal. Its first concept was intended to be used on Tychicus-class frigates to provide an even more superior anti-bomber screen for escorted destroyers, but UHI engineers dropped it in favour of standard plasma shotgun turrets to lower overall costs. Engineers onboard the ORFS Ida Lewis designed an amalgam of antimatter flak cannons based on data from the Samael-class destroyers to give the pilots of the Exodus Fleet a new and deadly weapon against the overwhelming Shivan fighters and bombers. The high production cost of antimatter projectiles excluded the Polyhydra from the warship mounting program, but after the discovery made by Ida Lewis engineers, factories onboard the factory ships were quickly adapted to obtain anti-hydrogenium. Factory ships renewed the production of Demolisher torpedos, but main goal of the engineers quickly changed. Gauss cannons can launch antimatter canisters with great speed and having reached the target its contents will annihilate surrounding matter creating splash damage. Version 111x of the Polyhydra cannon is the first area effect weapon available for Syndicate pilots. Extremely deadly against well-armored targets but ineffective against shields, the Polyhydra is the weapon of choice when used alongside an anti-shield weapon. Pilots are also advised to use the Polyhydra to destroy incoming bombs.", 5955)

The ORW-AS35 B variant is a very distant descendant of the Avenger cannon. With the recently encountered Durja and Kasdeya bombers, construction of anti-shield cannons was increased. While a new variant of the Locust FFSP was the first answer to this problem, the Eviscerator was the second and ultimate. The Eviscerator was inspired by the plasma shotgun Turrets mounted on almost every Syndicate battleship. The Eviscerator fires a pulse of ionised particles, which are extremely effective against Shivan shields. A single pulse can strip off the shields of even the heaviest Shivan bombers and allow the delivery of tremendous amount of firepower from heavy weapons, the like Scythe, Incisor, Polyhydra or Redeemer to their hulls.

+Tech Description: XSTR("One of the most briliant inventions ever created by the ORS engineers of Massive Dynamic. The Hurricane is a distant descendant of the Synaptic missile. A single torpedo contains 30 small plasma charges equipped with simple engines and a heat-tracking targeting system. A skilled pilot is able to destroy whole wings of Shivan fighters and bombers approaching a target in cluster formation. Despite extremely high costs and a significant consumption of resources, the Syndicate decided to continue production of the Hurricane onboard the factory ships because of its extreme efectiveness. Only the best squadrons are authorized to use the Hurricane so far. Pilots are advised to remotely detonate Hurricane 300-500 meters in front of enemy formation. This weapon is also very popular (although dangerous) in close combat. ", 6145)

The Hi-tech successor to the old Stiletto missile, the Pulverizer is the best anti-subsystem weapons avaliable for ORS bombers during the Rim Conflict and later, after the invasion of the Shivan Armada. This sophisticated missile is equipped with an aspect-seeking target system, advanced engines and iridium plating designed to absorb radio waves, makes the missile virtually impossible to be destroyed. Fired Pulverizes have a 99% chance of successfully reaching their target. The Syndicate never restored the capability of producing Pulverizers as the low-tech factories onboard Hephaestus-class vessels rendered production of such an advanced weapon impossible, but the Black Operations Department elite gunship squadrons are still in possesion of large amount of these priceless missiles. Pulverizers are extremely effective at destoying the spinal beam cannons of Shivan destroyers. ", 6154)

Designed after the Great Exodus by engineers onboard the ORFS Ida Lewis, the Chrabaszcz is mostly used by Krios light bombers.", 6158)

Instead of developing another big and sluggish torpedo like the Great War era Tsunami and Harbiner, Massive Dynamic decided to design a series of smaller, linked warheads with a common targeting system. A well deserved successor to the Harbinger, the Revenant is a swarm of torpedoes in quad configuration. An advanced targeting system transmits data between each warhead until they reach thier final target delivering a deadly blow. This expensive weapon is used only by elite ORS bomber and gunship squadrons and only against critical targets. In comparison to the Chrabaszcz and Demolisher, the Revenant does not require a target lock due to its heat-seeking guidence system. A simpler version of this weapon stripped of its linked targeting system is used by ORS heavy warships in large amounts to confront Shivan warships.", 6166)
