XSTR("In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. Several artifacts found there explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

On March 29, 2335, the Lucifer entered the Delta Serpentis-Sol jump node. Thanks to the data discovered at Altair, a joint Terran-Vasudan taskforce was able to pursue it into subspace and launch an attack while it remained unprotected by its impenetrable shields. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

Although the mission was a success and the Lucifer was destroyed while entering the Sol system, the resulting explosion created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Delta Serpentis jump node, severing all contact with the Terran colonies beyond the Sol system.", 5553)

XSTR("The end of the Great War in 2335 marked the start of a new era for the Sol system. With all communication to the rest of Terran space severed, millions of people in the Sol system lost contact with their families in the Terran colony worlds. With fear of the Shivans continuing to grow, it became clear that the Galactic Terran Alliance needed to change radically to adapt to new circumstances. For the first few months however, the Earth-based GTA government concentrated on internal political reforms rather than restructuring the Alliance governmental and economic system as a whole. 

From an economic point of view, the highest price of the collapse of the Delta Serpentis node was paid by large Earth and Martian corporations including the Han-Roland Corporation, the Mesa Corporation and Triton Dynamics. They had been the corporations most strongly dependent on resources from other systems. Losing their supply routes to the rest of Terran space resulted in the loss of trillions of credits and forced them to reorganize their corporate structure and seek new resources. 

And they found them. Their attention, once focused on offworld colonies in Delta Serpentis, Beta Aquilae and other star systems, was now turned back to Sol's outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their numerous moons. Those corporations entered these new markets very aggressively and began construction of new colonies, mines and gas refineries. 

Their fast expansion, however, threatened the position of minor economic players still dominant in the Outer Rim, including Valhalla Shipyards, United Heavy Industries, Bamiyan Development Corporation and Massive Dynamics. Old and new corporations began intense competition for the most valuable sources of gas and minerals which quickly evolved far beyond standard free market rules. As Inner Rim corporations based on Earth and Mars eventually failed to dominate the Outer Rim, they requested aid from the GTA government still based on Earth. 

On January 11, 2338, the GTA announced a controversial Great Perseverance Plan (GPP) meant to respond to the political, economic and social consequences of the Delta Serpentis jump node collapse. The GPP was a 784-page-long document involving administrative reforms, military service reforms and other additional changes in a variety of areas. Its size, however, was intended to disguise its basic purposes: 

1. Grant corporations based on Earth and Mars exclusive rights to the most precious mineral sources in the Outer Rim;
2. Guarantee Earth and Martian corporations a primacy over Outer Rim corporations in all future spaceship construction programs;
3. Enforce massive resettlement actions from overpopulated areas of Earth, mainly African, Arabic and South-Asian regions, to the newly constructed colonies in the Outer Rim;
4. Centralize the structure of the Alliance Revenue Service and allow unrestricted taxation of Outer Rim colonies by the Earth-based GTA government.

It was later proven that the GPP was heavily influenced from strong lobbying by the Han-Roland Corporation. The other Inner Rim corporations' involvement in the GPP's legislation was never confirmed, but speculation about their influence in crafting the GPP continues to this day.

XSTR("Enforcement of the GPP began on March 7, 2338 with the first corporate freighters arriving at their designated mining sites at Ganymede. Miners employed by Ganymede Works, a subcontractor for Valhalla Shipyards, were ordered to abandon their stations. Between March 7 and April 12, a total of 651 mining and gas extraction sites were taken over by Earth and Martian corporations following the first stage of the GPP. In most cases, the takeovers were carried out peacefully, although more than 50 incidents of violence did occur. 

In order to oppose enforcement of the GPP, Outer Rim corporations began suing the privileged Earth and Mars corporations and accusing them of unfair lobbying and corporate malfeasance. Protests also took place in major Outer Rim colonies as people expected the new employers to provide inadequate working conditions. These actions were for naught, however, as the GTA judicial bureaucracy dismissed the lawsuits and the protests swayed the opinions of virtually none of the GTA politicians. Meanwhile, several of those same GTA politicians began an organized campaign of propaganda against the Outer Rim corporations. Hobart Ericsson, the GTA's Secretary of the Treasury, accused the Outer Rim corporations of becoming 'a criminal syndicate that is destroying the stability of the Alliance and threatens our jurisdiction in the whole sector'. Almost fourteen months later, Secretary Ericsson's words would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

On May 1, 2338, the GTA announced a new warship construction program involving 12 new Orion-class destroyers equipped with a new generation of weaponry. As the GPP guaranteed, all of the construction contracts were given to corporations from Earth and Mars. Following further enforcement of the GPP, new taxes were introduced in Outer Rim colonies in order to meet the increased government expenditures. In fact, the Jupiter and Saturn colonies were required to pay Earth and Martian corporations to fund the construction of the new GTA fleet. 

The GPP brought numerous economic problems to the Outer Rim colonies. By the end of 2338, Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede were all struck by recession and unemployment following the shutdown of so many shipyards and factories and further tax increases introduced by the GTA government. Massive protests and rioting raged across the Jupiter and Saturn colonies and many of them were violently suppressed by GTA security forces and corporate mercenaries.", 5558)

On April 15, 2339, one of Han-Roland's supply convoys was ambushed in the Asteroid Belt. All of the freighters in the convoy were hijacked while the entire escort was destroyed. There were no survivors. In the following month, eighteen more attacks occurred, all taking place beyond Mars and all involving targets connected with corporations based in the Inner Rim. A Han-Roland spokeswoman called the attacks 'an organized terrorist activity probably sponsored by Outer Rim native industry.' GTA High Command responded with the deployment of the GTD Holmgard, commanded by Admiral Marcus Rossendarch, to maintain the security of the Asteroid Belt supply routes. This move, however, did not quell the attacks, but only further inflamed tensions throughout the entire Outer Rim. 

On May 29, 2339, the GTA government declared martial law throughout the Sol system and accused Outer Rim corporations of supporting terrorist attacks. Marines were deployed throughout the largest Jupiter and Saturn colonies and corporate security forces demanded unrestricted access to all Outer Rim shipyards. More than 80 representatives of United Heavy Industries were arrested and interrogated. One of these UHI representatives, Robert Sharif, then made a sworn statement that UHI shipyards were secretly producing fightercraft for terrorist groups. (Though rumors claimed that Sharif had been forced to make that statement, it was never conclusively proven if Sharif's testimony was made under duress. Only a few days after making his statement, Sharif disappeared and was never heard from again.) The GTA used Sharif's sworn statement as a pretext to justify taking the Outer Rim shipyards by force. The GTD Salvation, under the command of Admiral Ivanov, was thus dispatched on June 1 to take over the Adamant Shipyard in high orbit over Europa. The shipyard's personnel refused to obey the order to stand down and evacuate. GTA boarding parties then tried to capture the shipyard by force, but met with armed resistance and were forced to withdraw. Although Ivanov had been ordered to capture the Adamant Shipyard intact, seeing his Marines repelled by a bunch of poorly armed, ragtag civilians so humiliated him that he commanded the Salvation to fire on the shipyard despite his orders. As a result, all of the 4,000 civilians onboard the shipyard were killed when the Salvation opened fire and a further 40,000 civilians died when debris from the destroyed shipyard impacted several of the cities of Europa below. (Ivanov was never punished or disciplined for firing on civilians.)

This tragic event turned out to be the spark of rebellion. Two days later, on June 3, 2339, leaders of the 19 largest colonies of the Outer Rim gathered at an undisclosed location on Europa and unanimously signed the Europan Convention. This document was a formal declaration of independence from the Galactic Terran Alliance and became the genesis of the Outer Rim Syndicate.

In response, later that very same day, GTA High Command issued emergency orders to the 1st Gaian and 2nd Martian Fleets to set out for the Outer Rim, join up with the 3rd Jovian Fleet and end the rebellion by any means necessary.", 5560)

XSTR("FFollowing the proclamation of the Europan Convention, the rebellion began to spread throughout the Outer Rim. Mass protests and riots raged across the Outer Rim and armed resistance groups began taking over the seats of GTA governors and corporate offices. In some cases, mostly in small remote colonies, local authorities decided to surrender, flee or even join the protesters. In others, however, especially in strategically important mining sites on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, corporate security forces, determined to protect their employers' property from the angry crowds, responded with violence. This only further fueled the fire. Turmoil was also spreading among the personnel of the 3rd Jovian Fleet, the majority of whom had been born and raised in Outer Rim colonies. With open rebellion in the Outer Rim now a reality, the GTA saw no other choice but to wage open warfare to restore its authority. Naturally, many of the soldiers and sailors of the 3rd Jovian Fleet had no desire to go to war against their homes and families.

After the collapse of the Delta Serpentis node in 2335, the GTA had reorganized the Terran 1st Fleet of the Great War era into three separate units: the 1st Gaian Fleet guarding the core sector of Earth and Luna; the 2nd Martian Fleet securing Mars along with its moons Deimos and Phobos as well as the Asteroid Belt; and the 3rd Jovian Fleet stationed in high orbit above Jupiter, responsible for patrolling the Outer Rim sector consisting of the entire Sol system beyond the Asteroid Belt. The GTA's initial move of the Secession War was to deploy elements of the 2nd and 3rd Fleets into the low orbits of the rebelling colonies whose leaders had signed the Europan Convention. Their orders were to destroy or capture orbital defenses, major shipyards and primary industrial infrastructure, then deploy ground forces to take over the cities and arrest the leaders of the rebellion.", 5563)

XSTR("Because of growing unrest among members of the 3rd Fleet who hailed from the Outer Rim colonies, the GTA created mixed taskforces consisting of both 2nd and 3rd Fleet elements and tried to perform shifts in command structure so that major operations in the forthcoming offensive would be performed by commanders of unquestionable loyalty. This move forced some pro-Syndicate officers to reveal themselves, beginning with Admiral Glenzmann, commander of the 3rd Fleet. Glenzmann's flagship, the GTD Lazarus, refused to submit to GTA military police officers and fired upon 2nd Fleet ships that arrived to take Glenzmann into custody. The Lazarus then defected to the Syndicate and became the ORD Lazarus, a destroyer in the newly-formed ORS fleet. Glenzmann's renouncing of the GTA was followed by defections of many 3rd Fleet cruisers, carriers and utility vessels, the commanders of which refused to fight against their own kin. Other loyalist purges turned out to be successful, however. One such purge involved GTA boarding parties successfully taking the GTD Adrasteia by surprise and relieved pro-Syndicate Admiral Thanou of his command. Admiral Ivanov, who had already proven himself loyal to the GTA at the Adamant Shipyard, became commander of the remaining pro-GTA elements of the 3rd Fleet.

Personnel shifts in the 2nd and 3rd Fleets delayed the execution of GTA High Command's standing orders. On June 6, 2339, elements of the 2nd and 3rd Fleets including the Adrasteia and the Salvation arrived at Europa, Io and Ganymede, but the colonies had used the delay to mobilize their local defense forces. Following heavy fighting, the GTD Salvation's taskforce obliterated Ganymede's orbital defenses and commenced orbital bombardment of the moon's largest industrial complexes, resulting in more than 300,000 dead. Europa's defenders suffered great losses at the hands of the Adrasteia's taskforce and Europa was very close to sharing the fate of Ganymede as a result. However, the tide of battle was turned by the arrival of the Lazarus and a large ORS flotilla formed from 3rd Fleet defectors. After taking critical damage, the Adrasteia was forced to withdraw from Europa, resulting in the first major, though costly, victory for the Syndicate. At the same time, Admiral Tessandras of the GTD Apam Nepatis, commanding the 2nd Fleet's taskforce dispatched to Io, switched sides. Instead of attacking Io's defenses, he struck at the remaining loyalist forces and decimated them, as treason was the last thing the loyalists expected from a ruthless Martian admiral. The outcomes of GTA incursions at the other colonies varied. The colonies that began preparations early enough were able to drive off the loyalist forces, but the vast majority of the rest were not prepared to confront regular military forces and could only evacuate and watch from a distance as their factories and shipyards were reduced to rubble. In total, GTA raids and bombardments resulted in more than 10 million casualties and crippled the infrastructure, defenses and industry of most Syndicate colonies except for Europa and Io.", 5565)

XSTR("The GTA offensive against the Outer Rim colonies was a major blow for the newly-formed Syndicate. Infrastructure damage ruined ORS plans of using small remote shipyards for decentralized construction of a new fleet to confront the GTA. 3rd Fleet defectors also took heavy losses in the colonies' defense. On the other hand, the scale of atrocities committed by the invading loyalist force resulted in further radicalization of Outer Rim citizens and brought even more volunteers under the Syndicate banner. The ORS was swamped with volunteers determined to avenge their friends and families killed in the bombardments. Outer Rim citizens were more than willing to fight; they only needed leadership and organization to form them into a force that could confront the powerful GTA. 

On June 13, 2339 all the signatories of the Europan Convention gathered at an undisclosed location on Europa once again; some arrived in person, while others, having to deal with the aftermath of their ravaged colonies, were only able to attend via holoconference. Accompanied by representatives of many colonies that did not initially join the rebellion but were now outraged by GTA crimes, they formed the Syndicate Magistratorium, a joint council of colony leaders, corporate officials and military officers united by their vision of an independent Outer Rim free of Earth's tyranny, oppression and economic exploitation. They appointed Admiral Glenzmann supreme commander of all ORS forces and gave him the task of creating a new unified command structure that would better suit the decentralized character of the ORS and its unconventional warfare style. Two fleets were formed under the commands of Glenzmann and Tessandras. Fleet commanders were now called “fleetmasters” and ship captains were renamed as “shipmasters;” the other ranks in the ORS military hierarchy were likewise changed to emphasize their much wider autonomy and responsibility than in the GTA fleet. Befitting Glenzmann's greater authority as the supreme commander of the ORS military, he was awarded the rank of high fleetmaster, while Tessandras, as his subordinate, was given the rank of fleetmaster.", 5567)

XSTR("While Io and Europa were secure for the moment, other colonies still suffered greatly, either harassed by GTA raids or occupied by GTA ground forces. In order to maintain their war effort, the ORS began to upgrade old transports, freighters and miners into mobile production centers. The most successful redesign was the refit of the mining ship that became the ORFS Enutriet. In the following weeks a number of Enutriet-class factory ships began extracting minerals and gas throughout the Outer Rim, processing them into fuel, ammunition and spare parts, and delivering them straight to the warships and shipyards of the ORS. The ORS fleet at that time consisted mainly of Fenris- and Leviathan-class cruisers and Sagittarius-class light carriers that were reintroduced into service by the GTA shortly after the Great War. The fleet was soon strengthened by multiple refitted pre-Great War vessels that had been either docked idle near remote installations, used by local security forces or even already sent to ship graveyards waiting to be scrapped. Three Zagreus-class destroyers, the ORD Calixta, the ORD Enyalius and the ORD Leander, soon joined the Syndicate fleet, alongside 15 Atropos-class frigates and 40 Damocles-class cruisers. 

While High Fleetmaster Glenzmann was organizing the new Syndicate fleet, Fleetmaster Tessandras acted on his own initiative and took his fleet into battle, combining ORS guerilla tactics with his own combat experience from the Great War. He began aggressive hit-and-run attacks against GTA-controlled colonies and installations in the Outer Rim as well as GTA supply lines between Earth, Mars and Jupiter. The Asteroid Belt in particular became a site of several fierce battles between Tessandras' forces and the GTA taskforce commanded by Admiral Rossendarch of the GTD Holmgard. As both commanders possessed impressive tactical skills and unpredictable strategic acumen, this cat-and-mouse game lasted for almost two months and brought no decisive outcome. A major part of Tessandras' strategy involved deploying elite squadrons, such as the famous 199th Eviscerators, flying significantly upgraded Athena Mk II-class light bombers. Tessandras' attacks managed to keep Rossendarch and his forces at bay, thereby taking some pressure off Glenzmann's forces battling the loyalists across the Outer Rim. However, the Holmgard kept eluding Tessandras' traps and even managed to launch several impressive counterattacks. 

Once Glenzmann had finished gathering his forces, the ORS launched a large counter-offensive on August 15 to retake GTA-occupied colonies and convince hesitating, skeptical or threatened colonial governors to join their cause. The ORS taskforce joined up with local anti-GTA resistance forces, liberated Ganymede, Callisto and Rhea, and fought GTA forces at Iapetus and Titan. This ambitious offensive, however, spread the ORS forces too thinly and the GTA counterattacked. The Syndicate was forced to give ground at Iapetus and Titan, but managed to repel the GTA counterattack at Rhea. After holding and fortifying Rhea, the ORS successfully created a strong perimeter near Saturn. At the same time, local resistance forces grew stronger in the smaller colonies like Uranus' moon Ariel and Neptune's moon Nereid, so the GTA had to dispatch additional marine detachments to maintain their hold on those colonies.

XSTR("At the beginning of September 2339, the Secession War was still far from concluded. GTA and ORS forces had fought to a stalemate. The Syndicate fortified its positions on Europa, Io, Ganymede and Rhea while the GTA's control remained secure on Titan, Iapetus and most of the moons of Uranus and Neptune. Fleetmaster Tessandras and Admiral Rossendarch continued to keep each other in check in the Asteroid Belt and neither could gain an advantage over the other. 

On September 4, Admiral Donathan Walker, an up-and-coming GTA officer, took command of the GTD Proteus and the entire 1st Gaian Fleet. He appeared before the GTA Security Council and presented a bold and audacious plan: Operation Punisher. Walker proposed to break the deadlock by dispatching the majority of Earth's defensive forces to aggressively hunt down the Lazarus, penetrate its perimeter over Europa, and commence bombardment of the Galilean moons. Unlike previous bombardments of the Secession War, Walker did not intend to make precise strikes against factories, shipyards and military bases. Instead, he planned to decimate the population of Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede with massive thermonuclear explosions and thereby discourage other colonies from continuing the war. Other GTA admirals opposed this plan not only for moral and humanitarian reasons, but also because it would leave Earth vulnerable to an ORS counterattack. In particular, Admiral Hector Caliphtys of the GTD Ironclad very loudly insisted on continuing the war of attrition and crippling ORS infrastructure rather than leave Earth unprotected. Walker, however, remained committed to his strategy. To ensure that Caliphtys could not interfere with its execution, Walker reassigned the defiant admiral to a flotilla stationed in Earth orbit as a reserve. With Caliphtys sidelined, there was not enough opposition to keep the GTA Security Council from approving Operation Punisher.

On September 20, final preparations to launch Operation Punisher were underway. The 1st Gaian Fleet had been ordered to strike simultaneously at Europa, Io, Calypso and Ganymede. Luckily, ORS Intelligence found out about the offensive only a few hours before it was scheduled to begin, allowing the ORS to withdraw ships defending Rhea and several other colonies and redeploy them around Jupiter. The Lazarus maintained its patrol over Europa, while the Calixta, the Enyalius and the Leander defended Io, Calypso, and Ganymede, respectively. When Fleetmaster Tessandras, still fighting Rossendarch in the Asteroid Belt, learned of the upcoming attack, he had the Apam Nepatis launch its fighters and bombers against incoming GTA forces while he ordered the destroyer itself to redeploy to whichever moon first needed reinforcement. As the ORS fleet rallied to stand against the GTA invasion, civilian liners, supply ships, miners and transports from all over the Outer Rim began rushing to Jupiter to evacuate the moons' civilian population. The threat of genocide, this time at the hands of their Terran brethren instead of by the Shivans, rallied the Outer Rim's citizens to a common cause.

As both sides rallied their forces, the fate of the Outer Rim hung in the balance.", 5571)

The GTD Proteus, the GTD Dauntless and a large flotilla of GTA warships engaged the ORD Lazarus-led defense force in close combat while GTA bombers, hoping to divert some ORS forces from the main fleet, attacked civilian convoys fleeing from Europa. The same strategy was used at Io, Calypso, and Ganymede as well. After a fierce engagement, both sides suffered 70% casualties. The GTD Dauntless was so badly damaged that it was forced to withdraw while the Proteus and the Lazarus gave each other a wide berth to continue fighting at long range.

Io became the first of the Galilean moons to fall to the GTA. Having destroyed the ORD Leander and its entire fleet at 08:50 hours, the GTD Salvation began firing upon the surface of the moon with thermonuclear bombs. Fleetmaster Tessandras dispatched the Apam Nepatis in a desperate push to prevent further bombardment. Despite heavy losses, bombers from the Apam Nepatis' 199th Eviscerators squadron destroyed the Salvation's missile launchers. The Apam Nepatis then managed to destroy the majority of the Salvation's escort ships. However, the Apam Nepatis was soon caught in a cross-fire when GTA reinforcements led by the GTD Holmgard arrived. The Apam Nepatis' jump drive was damaged and Tessandras, unable to retreat, put the Apam Nepatis on a collision course with the Salvation and ordered his crew to abandon ship. As Tessandras and his surviving crewmembers dashed to safety in their escape pods, the Apam Nepatis collided with the Salvation, resulting in the destruction of both ships as well as the death of the Salvation's commanding officer, Admiral Ivanov, the Butcher of Adamant Shipyard.

However, the Adrasteia's fighter screen was stronger than expected and the Eviscerators lost more than half of their squad members as well as all their escort fighters. The surviving Eviscerators were ordered to retreat but refused to withdraw and they continued pushing forward while surrounded by GTA fighters.

The ORS' last reinforcements, led by the frigates ORFg Alexander and ORFg Antaeus, were deployed to destroy the heavily damaged Excelsior, but were stopped when the GTD Holmgard unexpectedly arrived from Europa.

XSTR("With Zion Installation destroyed, Earth collapsed into political chaos. GTA High Command had been totally shattered. Several commanders of GTA forces tried to act independently and continue the invasion of the Outer Rim, but without coordination they were easily driven off by ORS forces. More and more colonies of the Outer Rim rebelled against GTA authority and joined the Syndicate. Admirals Walker and Rossendarch returned to their home planets and began regrouping what was left of the GTA fleet. Mars itself wasn't saved from political turmoil, as many poorer provinces like Hesperia, Nepenthe and Syrtis used this opportunity to secede from the GTA. Despite Martian local governments sympathizing with Outer Rim ideology, the Syndicate did not possess the means to reinforce Mars with ground troops to defend autonomous provinces from GTA counter-offensives. For this reason, the Martian secessionists did not join the ORS; instead, they proclaimed their neutrality from both the GTA and ORS until the differences between the two powers were resolved. Thanks to Rossendarch's political efforts, Mars' most resourceful regions remained loyal to the old order and even became the most active political players within the GTA, preventing it from total collapse. 

Although victorious, the newly independent ORS was devastated and exhausted. Thermonuclear bombardment decimated the population of Calypso and inflicted heavy damage to cities on Io. Less than 30 percent of ships created by or defected to the ORS survived the final stage of the war. The only destroyers left in the ORS fleet were the heavily damaged Lazarus and Calixta as well as the newly-joined Ironclad. Admiral Caliphtys sent his forces to secure the Outer Rim, look for survivors in bombed colonies and fight any GTA holdouts still remaining in the Outer Rim. Many ship captains from Earth and Mars, suffering from lack of supplies and without orders from GTA High Command, surrendered or defected to the Syndicate. On September 24, Admiral Caliphtys met with High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, Fleetmaster Tessandras and several Syndicate Magistrates to merge his forces with the ORS military and officially accept the rank of fleetmaster. Although his attack on Zion Installation over Earth generated a lot of controversy, many in the ORS agreed that his actions prevented further bombardment of the Galilean moons, saving millions of Outer Rim citizens and the Syndicate as a whole. 

On October 18, a summit was called at Covenant Installation, located in neutral territory at the edge of the Asteroid Belt. Among the participants were Admiral Walker of Earth, Admiral Rossendarch and Prime Minister Bryant representing Mars, with High Fleetmaster Glenzmann and High Magistrate Helena Smithson representing the Outer Rim. As both sides were unable to continue the war, they agreed to a ceasefire and set a demarcation line along the Asteroid Belt. The Covenant Treaty signed between the Galactic Terran Alliance and the Outer Rim Syndicate was in fact the first recognition of ORS independence from Earth's government. It would be 12 years before the GTA's successor state, the Earth Federated Nations (EFN), would attempt to restore Earth's control over the Outer Rim again.", 5579)

XSTR("Freed from GTA rule, the Outer Rim entered a new era of economic growth. Far-reaching liberalization of economic policy combined with government help to regions struck by GTA bombardments allowed the colonies to recover from the war faster than anyone could have expected. Outer Rim corporations invested powerful financial and material resources in rebuilding Syndicate infrastructure and restoring the Syndicate's largest production centers. Two of the strongest participants in the reconstruction process were United Heavy Industries with a total expenditure of 118.8 billion credits between the years of 2339 and 2345 and Bamiyan Development Corporation with 61.4 billion credits spent during the same period. 

In exchange for their investments, several corporations gained a dominant position in Outer Rim markets and received government contracts on constructing new ships and military infrastructure. Shipyards around Jupiter and Saturn began mass production of the new Vitalius-class frigate, a fast, cheap and reliable frigate designed by Bamiyan Development Corporation that would form the mainstay of a new ORS fleet. 

Economic growth was followed by closer political integration of the Outer Rim. From a loose confederation and a military alliance of colonies dispersed throughout the Sol system, the Syndicate evolved towards a more centralized unified state. While respecting wide autonomy of the colonies' internal policy and their economic freedom, the Syndicate Magistratorium consistently acquired prerogatives over ORS' defensive policy, technological development, and maintaining diplomatic relations with a problematic neighbor -- first the GTA and later the EFN.", 5582)

XSTR("After losing the Secession War and the destruction of Zion Station, Earth lost both its central government as well as its privileged position within the Sol system's balance of power. Administration of Earth's remaining colonies was taken over almost entirely by Mars' pro-GTA factions and military commanders like Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch. Earth's local factions, the boundaries of which mostly reflected pre-unification national borders, took over the administration of ‘internal affairs.' 

By the end of 2340, Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch had regrouped the remnants of the GTA fleet and secured the GTA's remaining territories, so they intensified efforts to reunite quarrelling factions of Earth and Mars into a new centralized government. On January 20, 2341, leaders of the American Conglomerate, the European Union, the Indo-Asian Confederation, the Republic of China and 25 other factions met in Shanghai and formed the Earth Federated Nations. In a 74-page-long document called the Charter of Federated Nations, they announced that it was 'high time for Earth's government to stop existing only theoretically' and that 'Grand Terra needs leadership that will not fail her as the GTA of old did'. The radical, nationalist, and xenophobic wording of the document was a harbinger of the EFN's authoritarian nature. Despite initial reluctance, pro-GTA factions of Mars eventually joined the EFN, sealing the reunion of old GTA territories. 

The new Earth government made far-reaching political, social and economic reforms, centralized government administration, created a new fleet command structure, and passed strict corporate laws. Old corporations like Han-Roland initially protested against the new regulations, but their losses were promised to be compensated by the new EFN fleet construction programs. These privileges turned out to only be a facade as the quickly expanding EFN police and security services began removing disobedient management under false charges and made the corporations totally dependent on government policy. Propaganda showed corporations as a public enemy to justify deeper and deeper state interventions. It was just the first step towards a total surveillance state that would later become a routine fact of life for EFN citizens. 

Government-dependent corporations directed huge funds to construct a new fleet for the EFN. New ship classes were introduced like the EFC Evangelist-class cruiser, the EFFg Solomon-class frigate and the EFCa Praetor-class battlecarrier. With its surveillance state and terror machine growing, the Federation began to close the power gap between itself and the Syndicate.

The EFN introduced a new militaristic doctrine that included mass conscription, universal military education in schools and emphasis on order, law, and public service rather than freedom as well as the needs of society rather than the needs of an individual. The EFN spread propaganda of the 'New Earth nationalism' proclaiming the superiority of the 'true sons of Terra' over societies of other worlds (with exceptions made for 'Earth's eldest children' -- Luna and Mars). To reflect this propaganda of favoring Luna and Mars alongside Earth, the EFN fleets were reorganized into the 1st Gaian, 2nd Lunar and 3rd Martian Fleets.", 5584)

XSTR("In the late 2340s the ORS still benefited from the Post-Secession Boom and the EFN mostly restored its pre-Secession War economic potential. Since the end of the Secession War, the ORS and EFN maintained cool, if not overtly hostile, foreign relations (and even made a few bilateral trade agreements). As the Federation and the Syndicate continued to rebuild, however, the more hawkish factions in both states began to come to power. Shifts in government funding resulted in a rapid increase in spending on fleet construction, military infrastructure, and national security. 

It wasn't long before an arms race between the ORS and EFN resulted in growing unrest. An unfortunate chain of events took place between border outposts and patrols in the Asteroid Belt. Typically, a cruiser or frigate 'accidentally' fired upon the other side's convoy or a fighter wing got dangerously close to the demarcation line. 

The first serious incident happened on March 19, 2350 when ORS and EFN patrols clashed near Vesta resulting in the deaths of 2 Syndicate pilots and 8 Federate pilots. In retaliation, the Federation cruiser EFC Cretheus destroyed an ORS mining base on Ceres, killing 38 civilian miners and 9 military crewmen. Further escalation was halted by an emergency conference between High Magistrate Nehru and Federation Chancellor Archambeau where they both promised to restrain their more hawkish military commanders. 

Although the situation had officially calmed down, both the ORS and the EFN switched to waging covert actions. Across the Sol system unidentified fighters and bombers began attacking supply convoys, outposts and patrols, but both governments denied any responsibility for the attacks, instead claiming they were the work of ‘unaffiliated terrorists.' Military intelligence agencies and secret services also intensified their efforts to infiltrate the opposing side. The Federation had discovered the existence of the Syndicate's Enutriet-class factory ships and was determined to take away this strategic advantage from the ORS. EFN agents were given high priority orders to find the factory ships' staging areas and managed to find over 30 of them by the end of 2350.

In January 2351, under pressure from the pro-war faction led by Admiral Walker and Admiral Rossendarch, Archambeau was forced to resign the EFN chancellorship and was replaced by Thomas Warfield. Walker, Rossendarch and Warfield were all determined to start a war with the ORS as soon as possible before the newly-gained intelligence on the Enutriet factory ships became outdated.", 5586)

A now mostly terraformed planet with a population of 11.4 billion, enveloped by a slightly thin but breathable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, and covered with several landmasses of arid and temperate climates as well as several small freshwater oceans, Mars was divided into rich pro-Earth central regions and poorer, pro-ORS outlying provinces. On January 28, 2351, the EFN issued an ultimatum to the neutral provinces of Hesperia, Nepenthe and Tyrrhena, demanding unconditional surrender to the ‘legitimate EFN government.' Nepenthe and Tyrrhena agreed to surrender and submitted to Federation control. Hesperia, however, chose to fight. 90,000 EFN marines invaded Hesperia and the 3rd Martian Fleet commenced bombardment of Hesperia City. Sixteen days and 300,000 dead or missing Hesperians later, the Federation had full control over the province. 

Frightened by EFN expansion on Mars, the provinces of Aeolis, Cimmeria and Promethea requested Syndicate aid. The Europan government publicly refused to ‘interfere in the Inner Rim's internal affairs,' but secretly began sending convoys of supplies, weapons, and ‘military advisors' to endangered provinces. On February 19, a demand to surrender was sent to Cimmeria by the EFN and was immediately rejected. 20,000 Cimmerian soldiers, reinforced by 6,000 ORS Marine advisors, defended the province against 50,000 EFN marines and the full power of the 3rd Martian Fleet for three weeks before they were eventually defeated. The Cimmerian soldiers and ORS marines who weren't killed or captured fled to several still-free provinces such as Eridania and Elysium to prepare them for the inevitable expansion of the Federate invasion.

In the meantime, the EFN military positively identified ORS soldiers among the captured Cimmerians. This violation of the ORS' publicly stated neutrality was used by the EFN as a pretext to attack the Outer Rim. On March 29, 2351, the Federation began a full-scale invasion of the Outer Rim, starting a conflict that would later be known as the Martian War.", 5589)

Aggressive fighter, bomber and cruiser raids took place throughout the entire Outer Rim, forcing the ORS fleet to spread themselves thin in defense of their own territory. The Federation deployed their new Praetor-class battlecarriers to serve as heavy command centers and forward bases for attacks on remote ORS outposts. This time, however, the Federation did not concentrate only on installations and moons, but struck mainly at the staging areas of the Enutriet-class mobile factories they had discovered beforehand. The Outer Rim infrastructure was heavily damaged again, although the Syndicate had several surprises for the EFN such as an experimental energy shield that protected Europan cities from orbital bombardment. 

At the same time, EFN ground forces supported by elements of the 3rd Martian Fleet conquered Elysium Island, completing the process of reuniting Mars under Federation rule. Remnants of the pro-ORS provinces' military formed a resistance movement and waged guerilla warfare on the invaders, but with no air support and limited supplies their combat capabilities were negligible. 

Perhaps the most intense battles were fought in defense of primary ORS shipyards like the ORI Valhalla where new Galahad-class heavy destroyers were being constructed. Three Galahads in various stages of construction, including the lead ship ORD Galahad herself, were destroyed during the raids. Four others, however, including High Fleetmaster Glenzmann's new flagship, the ORD Thor, survived the raids and soon joined the ORS fleet at full combat readiness after they were completed. (Since then, no Galahad-class ships have ever been destroyed by the Federation.) 

For the first weeks of the war, however, the EFN failed to realize that their focus on the Enutriet mobile factories was part of a Syndicate ruse. In fact, by this time the Syndicate had already developed a new-generation mobile infrastructure program and by focusing EFN attention on the Enutriet mobile factories, the Syndicate kept the existence of the newly-constructed ORFS Hephaestus factory ships and ORSh Qadesh mobile shipyards secret. The new mobile factories and shipyards remained hidden mostly beyond Neptune's orbit, secretly processing minerals, manufacturing weapons, and constructing ships. The EFN discovered their existence in late April 2351 when fresh Syndicate reinforcements began appearing from nowhere and heavily damaged Syndicate warships were returning to the fray after only a few days when they should have been in space dock for weeks. In total, Qadesh shipyards constructed 68 Vitalius-class frigates and 14 new Tychicus-class heavy escort frigates during the Martian War. 

Having forced the EFN to waste its time trying to negate the now-obsolete Enutriet factory ships, the Syndicate was now preparing to strike back.", 5591)

Determined to bring the fight back to the enemy by any means necessary, Fleetmaster Tessandras formed the Black Operations Department (BOD). Comprised of upgraded Tychicus-class frigates and squadrons of next-gen gunships, bombers, and fighters, the BOD was created to take the most difficult assignments, strike far beyond enemy lines, and attack enemy supply routes, infrastructure, and utility ships. With this new unit, Tessandras perfected his ability to conduct covert operations, launch hit-and-run attacks, and withdraw before the enemy could react. The BOD performed long distance raids on EFN military installations orbiting Earth and Mars, ambushed Federation forces trying to bomb targets in the Outer Rim, and hunted enemy carriers in order to take pressure off regular Syndicate forces. Aside from precision strikes, the BOD also developed a vast network of spies, assassins, infiltrators, and saboteurs covertly placed in the EFN-occupied sectors of Mars as well as on Federation installations and even front-line Federation units. 

On July 27, 2351, the Syndicate launched a massive offensive against Mars. The fleet led by the ORD Damascus destroyed the Orion-class EFD Invictus at the Battle of Deimos, a costly victory for the ORS. Simultaneously, the ORD Thor attacked Augustus Station, the primary EFN shipyard in Mars orbit, destroying the still-under-construction Praetor-class EFCa Churchill and the entire 3rd Martian Fleet.

BOD operatives had spent several weeks infiltrating occupied provinces, seeking remnants of the resistance, and organizing volunteers to take up the fight for the liberation of Mars. It wasn't long before open rebellion broke out in the major cities of Cimmeria, Cydonia and other provinces. Several important Federate governors were assassinated in the confusion. Simultaneously, ORS forces led by Fleetmaster Caliphtys of the Ironclad began bombarding planetary defenses and military garrisons located in pro-EFN provinces on Mars. 

At 17:00 hours on August 1, the Syndicate commenced Operation Iron Rain. 2,800,000 ORS soldiers began the liberation of Mars, making it the largest planetary invasion since the Unification Wars. ORS forces landed mostly in the EFN-occupied provinces of Cimmeria, Aeolis, Eridania and Elysium Island where they joined forces with the resistance. On the opposing side, the EFN ground forces on Mars comprised of more than 2,200,000 regular soldiers, 900,000 militiamen and mercenaries and 9,000,000 conscripts. However, they were spread thinly across the surface and morale among the irregulars was very low. Using their temporary orbital superiority to their advantage, the Syndicate made a special effort to bombard only those areas where the regular EFN ground forces were concentrated and leave the irregular forces alone in an effort to sway the native Martians to their side. 

After initial victories at Elysium and Cimmeria, the ORS offensive headed west to the heavily fortified regions of Eridania, Tyrrhena and Hesperia. There, however, they encountered heavy resistance. Until mid-September both sides struggled to advance, but despite several hundred thousand casualties on both sides, a stalemate ensued on Tyrrhena Plateau and Hesperia's eastern border. As all attempted offensives were held off by the opposing side, both armies used their numerous construction drones to build huge fortifications hundreds of kilometers in length and garrisons placed mostly under the planet's surface. The stalemate wasn't broken even by intensive orbital bombardments commenced by both sides nor by biological and chemical weapons reintroduced by the Federate military. ", 5595)

After having stormed the defenses of Io and Ganymede, destroying two Orion-class destroyers, the ORD Cataphract and the ORD Vesuvius, the Tiberius and its fleet commenced orbital bombardment of both moons. Simultaneously, Walker dispatched small hunter-killer teams comprised of 3 Solomon-class frigates each equipped with advanced jump drives to harass ORS second-line units with devastating shock-jump attacks. 

Forced to choose between continuing the offensive on Mars, making a surprise strike at a now vulnerable Earth, or withdrawing to defend the Outer Rim, High Fleetmaster Glenzmann chose the last option, leaving the ground troops still fighting on Mars with the support of only the Ironclad's war-torn flotilla. The Thor then headed for Io to confront the Tiberius. Familiar with a Galahad-class' close combat capabilities and having learned a hard lesson from Operation Punisher, Walker gave Glenzmann's flagship a wide berth and sent bombers to destroy the Thor's primary railguns. The strategy worked and the partially disarmed Thor became an easy target for the Tiberius' fleet. Luckily for Glenzmann and the Thor, BOD frigates arrived and inflicted enough damage to the Tiberius' escort to allow the Thor to escape. The Tiberius continued to bombard Io and damage the moon's orbital infrastructure for eight hours before the Thor and the BOD frigates could regroup and chase the Federate battle group away from Io. 

For the next few weeks, the ORS was on the defensive again. Walker kept striking at Syndicate targets across the Outer Rim, earning himself the title 'The Lion of the Federation'.

As both commanders were too cautious to risk a frontal assault, they sent skirmishers on flanking attacks, made precision orbital bombardments and launched bomber raids against their opponent's ground forces still stalemated on the planet's surface. In the following months, Martian cities were pounded into rubble and –- according to post-war estimates -- more than 30,000,000 civilians were declared dead or missing. 

Hoping to break the deadlock, the Federation began preparations to use Xanthean Gas, an experimental chemical weapon of mass destruction named after Xanthea, the Martian province where the secret facility that had created the weapon was located. Although after the war the EFN banned the weapon and classified all data pertaining to Xanthean Gas to prevent it from ever being used again, it was revealed that the gas was in fact a swarm of self-replicating nanobots that could direct its poisonous cloud in any desired direction. Each nanobot performed a micro-scale chemical reaction that transformed components of the terraformed Martian air into a deadly poison gas. 

The EFN first used small samples of Xanthean Gas on several remote sectors of the front lines. The poisonous cloud directed by the nanobots was capable of penetrating or damaging air filters and gas masks, entering deep into ORS fortifications, and even choking entire battalions in their own barracks. Syndicate marines were forced to leave their prepared positions and defend in the open field, making them vulnerable targets for EFN bombers and artillery. More and more garrisons were being decimated and the ORS saw no way to counter Xanthean Gas other than to destroy entire infected facilities. Hoping to prevent the total defeat of their forces, the ORS prioritized finding the source of the deadly weapon. 

BOD operatives managed to locate the Xanthea facility where the nanobots were being produced and stored. On October 6, 2351, the ORD Ironclad entered Mars' low orbit and, while under the heavy fire of EFN planetary defenses, destroyed the facility with its cannons. This action, however, instead of removing the threat, merely opened the floodgates. The data that ORS Intelligence agents had gathered on Xanthean Gas nanobots indicated they could not survive a planetary bombardment of that scale. However, unbeknownst to the ORSI agents, the facility also contained the next generation of nanobots that were more resistant to physical damage and high temperature. After the bombardment, these nanobots were damaged and became nonresponsive to remote shutdown attempts, but were still operational. As a result of the bombardment, they went haywire and began poisoning the atmosphere. Larger and larger areas of Mars became contaminated, previously breathable air became poisonous, and toxic rains began destroying the terraformed vegetation so difficult to grow and adapt to Martian conditions.", 5599)

Soldiers of both armies who were still able to act were sent to provide humanitarian aid to Mars' civilian population and deal with the damage dealt by Xanthean Gas.

XSTR("The Martian War ended in a draw, but its aftermath was far more consequential to the Federation than one would have expected. A peace initiative undertaken by Martian leaders was taken as an insult by the Earth regime as well as by the military units under Admirals Walker and Rossendarch, both of whom insisted on continuing the war. Open and successful opposition to the EFN agenda by Mars encouraged Earth's less radical parties to demand political reforms such as restoring GTA-era individual liberties and restraining internal security services from persecuting their own citizens. Mass protests broke out in New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other major cities on Earth, but they were brutally pacified by police and military alike. The government responded with more radical propaganda, greater restrictions on freedom of speech and even more government surveillance of the civilian population. In October 2352, a year after the Hesperian Armistice, the EFN had become a fully totalitarian regime where every aspect of life and the economy was controlled by a paranoid, fascist government. 

The direction of EFN policy was another reason for further tensions between Earth and Mars. The assorted provincial governments of Mars concentrated their efforts on fighting the Xanthean cataclysm, clearing the atmosphere of the nanobots, decontaminating the Martian environment, and providing humanitarian aid to the residents of the most vulnerable areas. EFN-aligned Martians had no problem working with the governments of pro-Syndicate provinces or even accepting aid from the ORS itself to clean up the Xanthean disaster. 

No dictatorship could remain in power without directing social anger against an enemy -- real or imagined. In August 2354, the government in Shanghai nationalized Triton Dynamics and arrested their board members officially for fraud and tax evasion, but the real reason was because the corporation supported the Hesperian Armistice and cooperated with ORS rescue and decontamination teams. 

This policy of full centralization and terror adversely affected Earth's economy. In December 2354, following the nationalization of Mesa Corporation, the stock markets collapsed and resulted in Earth's greatest recession in 120 years. The political officers and statesmen that replaced corporate management made a series of tragic mistakes and military production began to drop. 

In order to save the EFN from total economic collapse, Admiral Walker announced martial law throughout EFN territory and gave power to a new government comprised entirely of military officers and technocrats loyal only to him. They began a purge in the EFN administration, arrested politicians and statesmen responsible for previous disastrous policy and sentenced them to death or imprisonment in show trials. They restored some of the previous more liberal corporate laws, but they didn't end the persecution and government surveillance of civilians. The economic crisis in the EFN ended in 2358, but even then, the Federation hadn't regained its former vitality. Admiral Walker continued to be the strongest force in EFN politics while Admiral Rossendarch focused on reorganizing the 3rd Martian Fleet and his own secret military projects. 

Throughout the 2360s, the ORS was the dominant faction in Sol and the EFN's influence was restricted to Earth, Luna, the central provinces of Mars and several outposts on Mercury and Venus. However, as the economic situation on Earth began to slowly improve, Admiral Walker's agents in the EFN government began a new fleet construction program, introducing new ship classes like the EFC Viscount, the EFFg Vidar and the EFD Talos, the latter of which was specifically designed to confront the Syndicate's Galahad-class heavy destroyers in close combat. 

Meanwhile, in the Outer Rim, seeing the EFN's weak but improving economy as an opportunity that could soon slip away, the Syndicate began preparations in early 2367 for a preemptive strike to bring the Federation to its knees once and for all. ", 5604)

This time, however, the Syndicate would be the one to strike the first blow. For several years the Federation had been struck by economic crisis and political turmoil, but it had begun to recover. The choice for the ORS was simple: either the ORS could make a preemptive strike from a position of strength now, or the Federation would rebuild its military power and start yet another war with the Syndicate in a few years anyway. Seeing no viable alternative, the Syndicate Magistratorium approved Operation Mjolnir, Glenzmann's plan to preemptively strike the EFN. 

Fleetmaster Tessandras and his BOD operatives had spent several years reconnoitering the defenses around Earth. After the Martian War, the Federation's strategy had been focused on defense rather than launching large offensives. Earth itself was protected by a barricade of warships, heavily armed installations and sentry guns. Meanwhile, several Praetor-class carriers were randomly patrolling near the EFN-ORS border ready to provide fighter and bomber support. If a Syndicate offensive on Earth was to have any chance of succeeding, those Federate carriers had to be tracked down and destroyed. 

After years of effort, a BOD sleeper agent successfully advanced though the ranks in the EFN military hierarchy to become chief engineer on the EFCa Praetorian. While undercover, he created an undetectable quantum network connected with other deep cover BOD agents operating on the EFCa Hadrianus and the EFCa Septimus. Through these agents' efforts, the ORS was able to discover that all three battlecarriers were stationed at several rally points near Ceres. 

On October 3, 2367, the agents sent their locations to the ORS via subspace micro-tunnels. The ORD Thor, the ORD Sultan, and their battle groups jumped to the rally points and attacked the three EFN battlecarriers. During the battle, the quantum network was activated and a techno-virus sabotaged the jump drives and primary weaponry on all three battlecarriers. The ORS destroyed the battlecarriers and their escort ships, opening a path for a Syndicate offensive on the Inner Rim.

Even in central, traditionally pro-Earth provinces like Xanthea and Acidalia, a pro-ORS political party began to rise in popularity and influence.

In exchange for formally joining the Syndicate, or at least disarming Federate military and planetary defenses, the Syndicate promised not to bomb any targets in these provinces and guaranteed them full autonomy within the Syndicate after the war. While the previously independent provinces of Hesperia and Cydonia were more than eager to get rid of Federate rule once and for all, Xanthea, Meridia and most central provinces remained loyal to the Earth government.

His old ship, the ORD Ironclad, was also present under the command of a young and promising fleetmaster named Horatio Tyrone. Admiral Rossendarch defended Mars for four days, but eventually withdrew his flagship to Earth and undertook no further actions apart from launching fighter and bomber raids. 

With almost full domination in both space and air support, the ORS ground forces advanced rapidly on the planet's surface. Hesperia, Cydonia and several other provinces were captured after only a few weeks of fighting. Entire EFN battalions from these provinces defected to the ORS with the blessings of their local governments. The ORS planned to take the fight to the central provinces where the pro-EFN loyalists were too strong for those provinces to switch sides. Unfortunately, the EFN had turned their major cities into mighty fortresses surrounded with thick walls and packed with artillery batteries and aircraft bases. To soften these defenses, Fleetmaster Caliphtys began massive bombardments of the central provinces. This stage of the war came to be known in history as the ‘Eighteen Days Bombardment of Mars.' During that period, the EFN military infrastructure was shattered, including the famous Acidalian Military Academy, numerous garrisons and several starports. 

On November 14, the ORS flag was waving over the capital of Xanthea while several other EFN provinces were almost overrun. Soon after, the Syndicate accepted the unconditional surrender of Meridia. The total liberation of Mars was at hand.", 5609)

XSTR("With the ORS' chain of victories on Mars, the EFN had written off the planet. Admiral Walker focused on fortifying Earth's defenses while Admiral Rossendarch launched a series of aggressive counterstrikes on the Outer Rim. ORS High Command [“Valhalla Command”?] was surprised at how easily Rossendarch put the dwindling Federate fleet at risk knowing he could not truly harm the Syndicate's production capabilities. The EFN warships fought valiantly at Ganymede, Titan, and in Mars orbit, but the ORS won all those engagements. Rossendarch's taskforces attacked in many places simultaneously, but they immediately withdrew soon after the arrival of Syndicate reinforcements. Rossendarch's flagship, the EFCa Sovereign, was ambushed by the ORD Thor in Europa's orbit and crash-jumped after taking moderate damage. Several Federate sources indicated that the Sovereign's jump drive exploded while in subspace, resulting in the destruction of the battlecarrier with all hands lost, including Admiral Rossendarch. Many other EFN ships participating in the counter-offensive met a similar fate. 

It remains unknown to this day what Rossendarch's intentions truly were. The most probable theory is that he tried to buy time for Admiral Walker and the 1st Gaian Fleet to finish fortifying Earth's defenses. It is possible the jump drives of Rossendarch's ships were hacked or sabotaged, but the ORS never confirmed such operations took place. Eventually, the EFN counter-strike inflicted only minor damage to ORS infrastructure, though it did force the Thor and several flotillas to temporarily withdraw to the Outer Rim and thus delayed the Syndicate offensive on Earth by two or three days. 

By November 15, 2367, the only EFN force that posed a threat to the ORS was the fleet gathered around Earth commanded by Admiral Walker, the Lion of the Federation himself. Walker was clearly ready to fight until the bitter end. The siege of Earth began on November 15 with aggressive ORS raids on the Blue Planet's orbital installations. On November 16, the ORD Sultan destroyed the massive Teheran Shipyard in lunar orbit and the next day the ORD Thor and the ORD Damascus destroyed the EFCa Executor and the gargantuan G1 command facility orbiting above North America.

Despite these victories, the ORS never got a chance to hunt down Admiral Walker and destroy the Federation for good. ", 5611)

XSTR("Founded in 2339 and formally known as the 'Church of Equilibrium,' the ultimate goal of the Equilibrists was to establish a single unified spiritual system of philosophy or quasi-religion. The purpose of this philosophy was the eradication of dogma-based beliefs, demagogy and superstitions among citizens of the Outer Rim. Also informally known as the 'Philosophers Guild,' Equilibrists were spiritual leaders of the population of planets lying beyond Mars and the Asteroid Belt. The initial concept of universal religion has been present since ancient times, but the actual organization founded by then-Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari was the first, widely distributed effort to establish a religious organization based on a concept of one universal and dogma-free philosophy. One of the major tenets of Equalibrianism was accuracy with modern science and Quantum M-Theory considered as currently valid.

Equalibrianism represents an agnostic view on the old question about God's existence. It rejects the traditional concept of God as a target of rituals, ceremonies and prayers represented by religions of old Earth and instead emphasizes natural balance and harmony of the Universe. There is a popular, although non-compulsory, Equilibristic concept of a meta-creative, omnipotent being capable of influencing the physical world by interfering with zero-state quantum fields of information, shaping events around all living, sentient, conscious beings and creating unique purposes for each of them. The direct reason for creating this concept was derived from official Syndicate propaganda. It was still centered around personal development and the concept of individual purpose, aligned with serving ORS interests and goals. Although initially criticized by early intellectual and scientific elites, it began to rise in popularity when the Secession War and the Martian War raged across the Outer Rim, strengthening the need for belief among both soldiers and civilians. This aspect of Equalibrianism became dominant after the Exodus and is represented by several influential figures within the Fleet and the Magistratorium like Fleetmaster Aasira Raji and High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari. 

An initial basis for Equalibrianism was Zen Tibetan Buddhism. Official propaganda of the ORS supported all kinds of spiritual practices with scientifically proven mental effects like reducing stress or increasing overall brain capacity. Meditation with the focus on internal calm, emotion tuning, and eradicating negative behavior was widely taught in all Equilibrist cathedrals among the Outer Rim. Although the majority of early ORS citizens were Christian, Hindu or Muslim, Equilibrist efforts successfully managed to convert the majority of ORS citizens to the Church of Equilibrium or persuaded them to adapt elements of Equilibristic philosophy into their old beliefs. The term Equilibrist describes both followers of the philosophy and activists of the Church of Equilibrium. Scientifically correct spiritual philosophy has proven itself extremely successful in maintaining social harmony mostly because it was compatible with many assumptions of already existing major belief systems. 'Leave all the dogma. Leave all the old books and people claiming themselves as saviors and prophets. The Universe is not judging, not forbidding, not siding with heaven nor hell. The Universe is shaping your path in this life, listening to everyone, and shaping your purpose individually. You just need to look inside yourself, and help the Universe help you find your place in this world.' Those and other simple tenets were very successful and popular among citizens of the ORS. Unlike many other religions, there was no concept of a creator of the universe in Equilibrist thought. The Universe was actually supposed to be its own creation, constantly maintaining itself.", 5629)

Equalibrianism was initially designed to be a supplement to the ORS' free-market economy and individual liberties to boost already excellent economic growth and uphold political stability. Equalibrianism was based on several hundreds of years' worth of psychological studies, and even more ancient teachings. In addition to eradicating all extremist and dogmatic beliefs from ORS society, Equalibrianism was created was to provide social stability, ensure economic growth, and support ORS military doctrine. The Church of Equilibrium is an extremely influential political tool, but its priests were also responsible for observing the state of social mentality. Ensuring the happiness of ORS citizens was a real long-term goal. A happy and wealthy society was an important factor in the economic supremacy of the ORS, and was also key to its eventual victory of the Rim Conflict.

A handful of individuals actually discovered their psionic potential thanks to meditation practices taught by Equilibrists. There were also reported cases of establishing temporary mental contact with beings of unknown nature and origin. All alleged mystic experiences were examined as part of the Blue Omega project, but its results remain highly classified. 

The dark, infamous part of the Church of Equilibrium were the Zealots – a group of BOD-trained agents that specialized in hunting down cultists, fanatics, terrorists, extremists, and EFN agents alike. These BOD-associated individuals were sometimes considered as a 'spiritual militia'. Although most ORS citizens were liberal in their beliefs and outlook, Zealots were active hunters responsible for erasing epicenters of so called 'dangerous thinking.' Although their covert operations were only meant to uphold ORS safety and were supported by the Magistratorium, the ORS military, and even the Black Operations Department, the Zealots became grim urban legends among some social circles.

Many Equilibrists survived the Exodus and reestablished the Church of Equilibrium onboard the colony ship ORCo Spirit of Hope. They now continue to provide spiritual support and guidance for fellow survivors in the Exodus Fleet. They are answerable directly to the renominated High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari.", 5631)

The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society. 

Since the 21st century, Earth was divided into several nation states competing with one another in space colonization efforts. Of these, the most important ones were the American Conglomerate, created after the bankruptcy of the United States of America; the federalized block of the Old World nations known as the European Union; and the Republic of China. Despite local conflicts, arms races, and constant rivalry, none of them were able to dominate the others and the network of economic connections was too valuable for anyone to benefit from a total war. In the beginning of the space colonization era, they had sent mostly separate expeditions and the newly created colonies belonged to their respective nations just like territories colonized by the European kingdoms in the Age of Exploration during the 15th through 17th centuries. However, the further the colonization process progressed, the less significant national boundaries between the colonies became, mainly because of the close integration of the Earth's nation states and the increasing role of the corporate sector in funding new expeditions. The process was even accelerated after the discovery of subspace in the mid-23rd century. 

However, old hostilities resumed at the beginning of the 24th century when Earth was hit by an economic crisis leading to a conflict known the Unification War. The devastating system-scale conflict lasted three years, but resulted in the ultimate dissolution of these national states and the creation of a planetary government known as the Galactic Terran Alliance. 

Earth remained the GTA capital world while the now-united Terrans continued space colonization efforts until the start of the Great War. After the destruction of the SD Lucifer and the isolation of the Sol system from the rest of Terran space, what remained of the GTA seat of government on Earth effectively became a government without a nation.

In 2339, the GTA collapsed as a result of the destruction of Zion Installation at the end of the Secession War.

Ganymede, whose dipolar magnetic field protected it from the radiation of its mother planet, was the first alternate candidate base of operations while Callisto was the second. Enormous volcanic formations found beneath the frozen surface of Europa and oceans of liquid water finally contributed to its eventual selection. A planetary-scale greenhouse effect was induced on Europa to melt the icy surface and generate a denser atmosphere to protect the new global oceans from Jupiter's radiation. Enormous floating cities were constructed on top of gigantic volcanic formations that had been discovered in 2029 under the ice. Although the global ocean of Europa reached down to 120 km beneath the surface, many large volcanic formations had been growing for millions of years and their pinnacles reached towards the ocean's surface, some of them only 3-7 km below the surface of the Europan Ocean. Those supervolcanoes became the foundations for the new floating cities. The largest one -- supervolcano Siraxta -- was even bigger than the Yellowstone Caldera located on Earth and became the foundation for the moon's capital city. All of the largest floating cities have been constructed on top of underwater volcanos, harvesting their natural thermal energy. The tallest of Europa's volcanoes -- the Sizifus -- is located on the southern hemisphere and is 73km high. It is also the highest known mountain in the Sol system.

The floating cities of Europa were well known symbols of prosperity among the citizens of the ORS, and proof of the technological advancement of the Outer Rim. Before the Shivan invasion, Europa was home to 430 million people living in the floating cities and on numerous orbital installations. Also, Europa was the largest source of water for the Outer Rim. Ganymede, Enceladus, Umbriel and some other icy moons went through a similar terraforming process but none became as prosperous as Europa. For many years, Europa was a shining beacon of Outer Rim independence, economic and scientific progress, and individual freedom.", 5647)

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. 

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device appeared on most Great War-era GTA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other when cooperating in their stand against the Lucifer armada. 

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War.", 5649)

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and if any research on live specimens has been conducted, then it was done outside of the Sol system after the collapse of the Delta Serpentis jump node. 

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. 

Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date.

"In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTA for interstellar travel were expected to remain stable for many years.

After collapse of the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node only infra-system jumps are performed within the Solar System. However, all military warships in the modern ORS and EFN fleets, most fighter classes and even the majority of civilian vessels are equipped with at least basic inter-system jump drive so both Solar factions were prepared for the future reopening of the Delta Serpentis node or discovery of new ones.", 3203)

I have a really bad feeling about the EFN's Project Sovereign. All the intel gathered by the Black Operations Department and Outer Rim Syndicate Intelligence indicates that Project Sovereign is refitting a Praetor-class carrier. Sensor readings from the construction site are similar to those recorded in Beta Aquilae when the Lucifer superdestroyer eliminated the Beta Aquilae Installation in 2335. Is the EFN trying to reverse-engineer Shivan flux cannon technology and install beam weapons on this supercarrier? I always thought that whichever side manages to produce a working version of this beam cannon will win the whole Rim Conflict. Up to now, both the EFN and the ORS failed in all their attempts to recreate flux cannon technology. Some of us hoped the Bamiyan Development Corporation engineers at Verdun station would solve the puzzle, but the only thing they successfully developed was a Shivan-inspired reactor coolant system later used on the Vitalius and Tychicus frigates and on the Galahad destroyers. Every prototype beam cannon constructed by the BDC engineers emitted too much excess heat. The energy requirements needed to power up just four beam cannons on a single ship were so ridiculously high that they severely impaired the other systems of the ship. That's why four H-variant Maul railcannons were mounted on the Galahad destroyers instead. If the EFN successfully reverse-engineered Shivan flux cannon technology and is currently mounting beam weapons onboard this Project Sovereign warship, then we've got a big problem on our hands.", 5656)

We've been trying to crack the object's external shell for eighteen hours. It's made of some kind of ultra-dense metallic fiber with a hexagonal, crystalline internal structure. I've never seen anything like it, but if the EFN are able to produce this material, I'm wondering why they don't armor their warships with it. Maybe they can't mass produce enough of it for all their ships? Anyway, the surface of this strange, boxy object so far remains impenetrable to all of our tools. It also resists lasers, plasma, meson streams, and even micro-substance disturbances. Since I wasn't authorized to study this object with 'conventional scientific tools,' I basically had no idea where I should start. We classified this thing as Object 419 under Category X -- a device of unknown origin and purpose. Really, pure fun. I do know one thing about it -- it's hollow. But whatever is inside it, if anything, is totally unknown. Object 419's length and width are both 112cm and it's 253cm high. It's a rectangular cuboid with beveled edges, has a seamless external sheathing and it's emitting high-frequency quantum pulses. The external sheath is made mostly of collapsed-core molybdenum, but also iridium and other elements I don't actually recognize. They're probably isotopes of previously discovered elements, but never before observed in a stable form. Perhaps they were obtained by methods unknown to ORS scientists...but why don't they match any known record? This case needs further investigation. The object has its own electrostatic and magnetic field, so it's basically levitating a few inches above the floor of our laboratory. I have this strange feeling that whoever designed this thing made every effort to seal it off and prevent any external force from opening it. More precise scanning detected the existence of a local subspace disturbance. Yi-Lin-Qui's subspace metrics indicated the regular amplitude of subspace vibration amounting to 41.73 EHz. As we all know, any subspace frequencies between 36.4 EHz and 241.18 EHz are stable, so Object 419 somehow interferes with the local intrasystem subspace field. So far, we don't know how or why. As Shivan subspace communication occurs on frequencies higher than 411.34 EHz, this fact rules out the possibility of this object being of Shivan origin. I need to get inside. I really didn't want to take this assignment, but now...my team and I really need to find out more about this thing.", 5660)

I officially have no idea what the hell is going on here. I was wondering if I'm actually crazy. There are strange things happening all over the Equilateral. Computers started to randomly generate data of unknown origin. Air in the lab is ionizing spontaneously and generating electrostatic discharges. I started to experience hallucinations and hear voices in my head. I see things. Shivan things. Shivans and some tall, pale humanoid creatures. They're talking to me in a language I somehow understand, but...they're not actually speaking. I have this strange feeling that they're talking to me...telepathically. My people reported similar symptoms, so I'm not the only one experiencing this. We figured out that Object 419 is probably the cause of this phenomenon. We sealed it off in the isolated bunker. The hallucinations and electric discharges disappeared, but our computers are still generating this strange information. We tried manually overwriting it; we even resorted to globally resetting the ship's entire mainframe. Nothing worked. Object 419 seems to have taken over our computers, but also somehow provides them power. One computer overheated and the whole laboratory almost burned to hell before we managed to get the fire under control. Thank god no one was hurt. The rest of the computers are calculating tremendous amounts of data from time to time. Several petabytes in 30-minute-long intervals. Analysis suggests repeatable patterns of data processing. I've never seen anything like it. I guess Object 419 is trying to contact us. Or it's learning about us. We'll try to convert these calculation patterns into...a language. Yes. I guess ‘language' is the proper word. Whatever is hidden inside Object 419, it's processing data at an amazing rate...and seems to be understanding it all.

It doesn't make any sense at all. We've been working on it for two days now and we still don't understand. If our results are correct, we estimated more than five thousand distinct letters of the alphabet used by Object 419. I've never seen anything like it...and this number is still rising. Our computers are working at full efficiency. We have lots of words in this strange language of Object 419, but there are so many.... We don't know how to make any sense of it, regardless of the fact that Object 419 seems to ignore all our attempts to communicate with it. So far, more than 10 percent of the data calculated by Object 419 are more or less understandable to us. Whatever the EFN sealed inside this molybdenum container is definitely trying to examine us and that's probably why they sealed this thing off. So far, this language is...non-deterministic and therefore impossible to understand. It seems to consist of an insanely large amount of extremely precise concepts. No human language has similar construction and no human brain is able to communicate with this degree of precision.

Each word is equal to one shape of a quantum string, so the number of concepts in this language -- and the letters themselves -- are virtually infinite. Object 419 is actually trying to find a method to understand our way of communication, probably to talk with us. We never managed to open its molybdenum sheath, but if we manage to do so, it would likely make its computations much faster and without side effects. Its current capabilities are severely limited, but still we have no idea what this thing would do outside its sheath. Until we manage to understand it better, the sheath is at least slowing down its efforts. So far, we know that Object 419 is not using any kind of electron streams, radio waves or any other classic forms of wireless communication. It has the ability to establish quantum entanglement between itself and our computers, but its entanglements are disrupted by the molybdenum sheath. This level of technology is incredibly advanced.... We all have this strange feeling that Object 419 is...an intelligent and sentient being...maybe some kind of hyper-advanced AI. Its code is probably too complicated to be described and understood by our computers...or we're doing it all wrong. Perhaps it's using the Equilateral's computers because it has nothing better to work with...or because it has no way to properly interface with a human mind. Dr. Ming proposed something controversial yesterday. Object 419 may actually require a connection to a quantum computer to communicate efficiently. Something that assigns each sign with its correct information in real time. Something like...a human mind. The hallucinations we experienced before were probably Object 419's attempts to communicate with us directly, but after that apparently failed it switched to the computers onboard the Equilateral. Object 419 appears to be...a telepathic quantum computer with an incredibly advanced AI. It's interfering with everything in close proximity, creating some sort of network. A thinking network.

It's open. Let me start at the beginning. Something strange happened (again). Object 419 finished its computations and we finally know the purpose it has been using our computers for during the last two weeks. But now the container is actually open. Its molybdenum armor was brutally ripped off from the inside. It was the last evidence we needed to support the theory that the EFN sealed it off, but...something tells me that the EFN needn't have bothered. I have this strange feeling that this green crystal inside the sheath is sentient and aware, but not hostile. Whatever it really is, it's currently...helping us power up the ship. The network of local quantum entanglements provides us an additional, wireless power management system. It resembles Nicola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower from the early 20th century, but where does its own energy come from? All readings of the Equilateral are nominal, so it's not using the reactor of the ship. This crystal must be somehow creating its own power. The crystal is levitating, emitting pulsating emerald light and it seems to be the core component of Object 419. The crystal is entwined by a network of metal wires and connected to a circular base. An identical, circular element is levitating above the top of the crystal. The internal structure of both elements is constantly changing, just like the network of metal wires. This strange, bright metal seems to be made up of elements that can act as a medium-temperature superconductor with minimal or even nonexistent resistance. This metallic compound was previously unknown to Terran or Vasudan science. The whole device was probably gathering energy for the last few weeks to break through the molybdenum shell, but now it's just sitting there after it finished its calculations.... And here's the strangest part. We just found out that Object 419 gathered and processed enormous amounts of information...from Terranet. It didn't use our conventional subspace routers, but the structure and size of the processed data matches other segments of the Terranet cloud, as if Object 419 could access it all at once, downloaded it and scanned it. Object 419 is...curious. It's curious about the ones studying it. It's curious about us.", 5668)

It's time to reveal something very important for the accuracy of this log. We deliberately ignored the majority of standard laboratory procedures, as ordered by the Black Operations Department.

Highly classified data proved many similarities to Shivan technology. [What similarities? Banner said in Entry 15 that Mastermind was definitely NOT of Shivan origin. So how could it be similar to Shivan technology?] Mastermind is made of biometal support components and a biocrystalline core. It is also equipped with a semi-sentient [Only “semi-sentient?”] conscious AI. The object is officially bioelectronic -- a perfect fusion of organic and mechanic elements. [WHAT organic elements? It's a crystal surrounded by metal wiring. There's no carbon here!

Doctor Gerard, Doctor Saldana, Doctor Trevetick, and I all believe that Object 419 is actually an artificially created lifeform.

Tessandras: Doctor Banner, are you sure of your theory?
Banner: I'm about 80% sure, Fleetmaster. Object 419 –- referred to by your investigators as Mastermind -- has been processing data and trying to communicate with us for the last five weeks. It used our computers to process various data about our species, civilization, culture and language...and I think we finally found a way to talk to it.
Tessandras: So...how exactly did you do it?
Banner: We attached quantum pulse receivers to interactive holopanels. We theorized that visualization would be the best way to communicate with Mastermind. Take a look, Fleetmaster. Even the very first results are already fascinating.
Tessandras: This looks like...a starmap of some sort?
Banner: Indeed. It looks very much like a starmap, marked with stable and unstable jump nodes. This central, yellow point in the middle is the Sol system. Object 419 is showing us some kind of strange disturbance of the local subspace field here in Sol. And here's another subspace disturbance field, with the Capella quadruple star system exactly in the middle. If I remember correctly, Capella was colonized by the GTA before the Great War, but we don't know what's going on there right now, apart from this subspace disturbance. This disturbance is expanding thousands of Astronomical Units from Capella's largest star....
Tessandras: There have been some...problems with precise subspace jumps in Sol for the past few days. Several shuttles and transports went off course after miscalculated jumps. This local disturbance could be the explanation. 
Banner: Indeed. Now we can see some subspace nodes collapsing and others forming. This is a direct repercussion of this Capella subspace cataclysm. The Altair system just lost its connection to Aldebaran. The same goes for Capella: it's now cut off from Vega and Epsilon Pegasi...but a new node is about to form. To the uncharted Zeta Puppis system.
Tessandras: And these indicators...what's going on here?
Banner: According to our astronomical data, this is Beta Volantis. A red dwarf.
Tessandras: Pretty close to the middle of the map. To Sol. And...something strange is going on here.
Banner: Yes. That's right, Fleetmaster. Something amazing is happening here. It's a subspace node! Beta Volantis is going to be connected with Sol!
Tessandras: Bloody hell! Doctor, what is the actual status of the node?!
Banner: Subspace vibration amplitude is 3.11 EHz and rising! We can expect stabilization of the Sol-Beta Volantis jump node in two to four hours. It's amazing!

Started by Galactic Terran Intelligence in 2335, Project Black Omega was a series of operations with the ultimate goal of capturing Human and Vasudan individuals with abnormal cognitive abilities, non-physical matter manipulation capacity, or unusual communication behaviour. The skills of those individuals, widely considered as subject of parapsychology were intended to be recognized, researched and reused for creating new technologies, or using the individuals themselves. The very limited success achieved by the project rendered Black Omega as a waste of resources and as a result unprofitable. The resources of Thanatos Station - HQ of Black Omega were redirected to an initiative known as Project Hades prior to the collapse of the Delta Serpentis - Sol jump node at the end of Great War. Still, the remaining data of Project Black Omega remained in the hands of crucial GTI personel, including Admiral Lenart Tessandras and Admiral Marcus Rossendarch.

The ExoTech Division of BOD restarted the project in 2351, after a mysterious explosion in Calixta city. Although the malfunction of core software of deuterium refinery 38 was revealed to the public as the official explanation, the field division of BOD researched one of bodies found in the refinery. Treated as a terrorist attack by a bomb-equipped GTI agent, the body was found at the epicentre the of explosion, while no signs of artifical explosives were ever found. Later intelligence actions revealed a secred program that was, in fact, an offspring of Black Omega. The terrorist attack in Calixta was conducted by a brainwashed agent with pyrokinetic abilities, maintained by experimental technology. No further examples of GTA and later EFN research of psionic powers were ever found, so the projest was likely to have been lost during the final collapse of the GTA, or it was presumbly continued by the EFN with no passable results.", 5680)

$Description:
XSTR("Conducted directly by Fleetmaster Tessandras, the Blue Omega Project started in 2352 and was progressing during the last years of of Rim Conflict. Through all these years ExoTech found and examined 1142 individuals with any kind of psionic capabilities. Common trait of all the test subjects were specific parts of DNA considered as remnances of viral remnance, actually active unlike other humans. However the theory of psionic abilities in homo sapiens as result of viral interference found no confirmation. Thanks to gathered psionics, ExoTech scientists succesfully researched the telekinetic and teleportation abilities of selected individuals to bend a local facture of subspace. Long term exposure to subspace travel was the official explanation accepted by some scientists, the telepaths were an even greater mystery. One notable fact was, that among the files of researched individuals, Aasira Esperanza Raji and Muhammad Al-Zardari names can be found with precognition and advanced telepatic abilities respectively. 

According to early the study of ExoTech scientists, telepathy was believed to be natural capability of establishing quantum entanglement between particles inside the synapses of two individuals, but further research has since brought this thesis into doubt. ExoTech researchers started to suspect, that human brains are in fact, constantly and spontaneously interacting on subconsciousness, empathic level even iver great distances. Sigmund Freud in the XIX century proposed an idea of a common subconsciousness, and theories with many similarities existed later but the concept was finally abandoned in the XXI century. Some of ExoTech researchers found many similarities also to controversial Etamnaki Project, and postulated similiarities between Human telepathy and the Shivan shared consciousness but on smaller, very limited scale. Project Trojan Horse, involving selected agents with telepathic abilities was rushed during the Martian War and Telepathic agents were equipped with biological implants based on Shivan technology, and later used to create a super-secret network inside the EFN fleets. Intel gathered, and sabotage performed by these agents later on revealed the EFN maneuvers in the asteroid belt, and allowed Fleetmaster Glenzmann and Fleetmaster El-Ghazzavi to attack the EFN fleet in the legendary Battle of Ceres. Project Blue Omega proven itself to be extremely valuable, and potentially lead to the ORS' eventual victory.

The Shivan Invasion in 2367 destroyed the labs as well as the many achievements of Blue Omega, but intel gathered over the years was essential for the rushing of Operation Moyses. Team of selected, technologically-enhanced telepaths known as Navigators were interfaced with a galactic starmap of unknown origin, and later set a barely safe course for the escaping Syndicate Exodus Fleet.", 5682)
