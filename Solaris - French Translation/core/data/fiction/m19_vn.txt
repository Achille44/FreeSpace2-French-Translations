MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "Lieutenant Ross. I hear your group was responsible for getting us out of Sulsia alive. Thank you." 7097 "19a-01"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "The loss of the Elgin was tragic. Even so, the Commonwealth embassy suffered minimal casualties." 7098 "19a-02"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "This attack on Commonwealth citizens wasn't a random Malikan raid. I'm afraid I must take partial responsibility. I work for ANI." 7099 "19a-03"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "I seem to have made some very well-resourced people upset, and unfortunately Commonwealth citizens were caught in the crossfire. When one can't find one's target, carpet bomb the ground around them and to hell with collateral damage." 7100 "19a-04"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "I have information that could lead us to Andri Gadaria's mysterious benefactor. The Malikans are a pawn in a greater game. We're now starting to find out who the players are." 7101 "19a-06"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "ANI will have need of your services soon. You can play at being mercenaries for a little while longer but don't drag your feet when Fleet calls. You still have your oath to His Majesty." 7102 "19a-07"
MSGXSTR "Opal Cross" 7096 "One more thing. The next time you two want to announce your Commonwealth credentials in public why don't you tight beam Admiral Romanowska into the conversation. Just for completion." 7103 "19a-08"

MSGXSTR "Navo" 4595 "Covenant isn't a system or a planet. It's a hyperspace capable habitat that's a hub for transports, freighters and refinery ships all in service with the Children of Renewal." 7107 "19a-12"
