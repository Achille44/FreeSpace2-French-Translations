Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.  Remember pilots, our victory does not diminish the danger of Shivan fighters.  Most Shivan craft are still considered a class 'C' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivans being the master race following our victory in Sol.

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the PVN have jointly approved plans to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the 'appropriate punishment for humanity's greed'.  While most of these factions are insignificant, GTA Command believes that one group, Humans Against Reckless Colonization (HARC), has placed several anonymous GTA officers on its payroll.  Any suspicious activities or persons should be reported to GTA Command."

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts, including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff, and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons, and even three capital ships -- the GTCs 'White Dwarf', 'Wayward Son', and 'Timberland'.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

10076, "Colonization Update

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies, and defense for our frontier colonization efforts, is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

At a recent press conference, Brian Giordino, president of HARC, issued the following statement: 'Although HARC despises the GTA's lust for universal domination and its tyranny over other alien cultures, we would never attempt to halt this evil with the blood of young Terran pilots.'"

10078, "EMAIL

To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations, pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today.

Captain John Wallace
GTD Nepenthe"

10079, "Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

10080, "Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destiny on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space.  Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy.  Omega 1 contains a drone pilot and no passengers."

10086, "Unfortunately, due to these safety precautions, GTA ships traveling to the Destiny from Beta Cygni require an escort to the safety perimeter.  Alpha wing will escort Omega to the Destiny.  Once the transports have reached the safe zone, oversee their docking operations and then return to the GTD Nepenthe."

10089, "The Destiny's fighters have been working back-breaking shifts since the rise of the mercenary rebellion.  Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

10090, "Delta"

10091, "If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

10092, "Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact, despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

10093, "Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan-class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intrasystem jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

10094, "Things got pretty rough out there.  You are to be commended for bringing your entire team back alive."

10095, "Although Delta wing really needed the rest, it is understandable that you called for reinforcements in the face of considerable opposition."

10096, "Try to complete the mission without calling for Delta wing."

10097, "The pilots on the GTD Destiny wish to thank you for handling the assignment without calling for them.  These weary pilots needed the rest badly."

10098, "We realize that things got pretty rough out there.  However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive.  With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

10099, "Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

10100, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

10101, "The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

10102, "Ultimately, this mission is a failure.  The personnel on board the Omega transports were the foremost experts on colonization science and technology.  Without them, we have little chance of successfully colonizing the new frontier planets."

10103, "The greatest threat to the Omega transports is the wing of Athena bombers.  You may want to divide your wing and send some of Alpha to take out the fighters, but make sure someone is taking care of those bombers."

10280, "Mercenary Update

Admiral Darcy issued the following communique from Lockheed today:

'The mercenary threat has been identified.  A Terran destroyer named the Nepenthe has gone AWOL.  A deeper investigation reveals that the ship's captain, John Wallace, is responsible for misleading the Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency to believe the merc force was being funded by HARC.  He has coordinated every attack from his flagship and must be brought to justice.'"

10281, "Mercenary Update (continued)

The following transmission was sent from John Wallace of the GTD Nepenthe this afternoon:
 
'The Terran race is an evil race of greedy souls whose consummate thirst for domination destroys everything it touches.  The GTA will pay for its sins!'

The statement seems to support Admiral Darcy's accusations."

10282, "Colonization Update

In other news, due to the scaling down of colonization efforts, the joint council has approved Mandala Prime as the new Vasudan homeworld.  Colonization will begin in two days."

10283, "EMAIL

To: 17412@nepenthe.gta

To all hands aboard the Nepenthe.  If you've read today's command briefing, then I assume you are frightened.  So am I.  We have been branded as traitors, and the GTA will throw everything they have at us.  I assure you all that I did not send that communique.  We have moved the Nepenthe into the shadows of the Casa Belt.  The joint council needs to know the treachery the Vasudans employed in order to win Mandala Prime.  Report for briefing in 20 minutes.

Captain John Wallace
GTD Nepenthe"

10284, "As you have probably all heard, the GTD Nepenthe is now the GTA's most wanted.  Although we have hailed the Alexander Bell comm outpost several times, our outgoing transmissions seem to be jammed."

10285, "Nepenthe"

10286, "In an attempt to avoid long range scans, we have moved the Nepenthe into the Casa Belt.  We will conduct a single operation here and then jump to the Alexander Bell and attempt direct contact."

10287, "Casa Belt"

10288, "We believe that the craft which blocked the Timberland's last outgoing transmission is shadowing us right now and prohibiting us from making our own outgoing transmissions."

10289, "Alpha wing will fly bombers and take this craft out.  Beta wing will provide cover.  Remember Alpha, this craft contains some sort of radar jammer, and locking weapons will be of no use to you."

10290, "Once you have removed the craft, return to base.  Know that the Alexander Bell is the only ally we have right now.  Both species want us dead... expect heavy resistance."

10291, "Excellent work pilot.  You were successful in taking out the unknown craft.  The craft was a modified Vasudan freighter and contained stealth technology and powerful communication devices.  Under any other circumstances, I would have ordered this craft captured.  However, we don't have that luxury right now."

10292, "Although we didn't have much time to hail the Alexander Bell, it appeared that our message was going through.  Unfortunately, the communications outpost was not responding.  Since we are so far away from our home system, we will need to relay our message off of the Alexander Bell."

10293, "You succeeded in taking out all Vasudan fighters in the area.  In the light of recent developments, it sadly appears that every Vasudan craft which is destroyed will ultimately help the GTA in the coming months."

10294, "Several Vasudan fighters left this battle with their lives.  Each Vasudan that survived today will make it more difficult for us in the future."

10295, "Try to take out all of the Vasudan fighters."

10296, "Even in our desperate situation, your team was able to knock out two Aten-class cruisers.  This is an extraordinary accomplishment."

10297, "You failed to locate the jamming craft.  We have no hope of contacting GTA Command now.  We can expect no quarter from Admiral Darcy.  We haven't much time to survive."

The Vasudan fleet is mobilizing in Manda to begin colonization of Mandala Prime.  Colonization will begin tomorrow at 0700 hours."

10327, "Mercenary Update

The rogue destroyer, the GTD Nepenthe, has managed to evade the GTA.  Apparently, the destroyer and her crew attacked a Vasudan science vessel which was studying the effects of asteroids on radio transmissions.  This outrageous slaughter has enraged Vasudans and Terrans alike."

10328, "Health and Science Update

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communications Station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus.  The outpost has been shut down and all transmissions from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destiny."

10329, "As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a so-called virus outbreak.  We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command.  A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

10330, "Alexander Bell"

10331, "The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters.  Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

10332, "We know the workers on the outpost are not suffering from a virus.  We believe that the Admiral has reconfigured the radar dish so that the Bell cannot communicate.

Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

10333, "Our long range scans indicate that there is some sort of remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar.  Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell.  Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

10334, "I used to fly for GTA Special Ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

10335, "Apocalypse"

10336, "Hopefully, we'll survive long enough to get our message to Command.  It all comes down to this, ladies and gentleman.  May this be the last time we ever take the lives of other Terrans.  Godspeed."

10337, "Congratulations everyone for an outstanding job.  Knocking out the Alexander Bell's radar allowed the Bell to transmit our information to Command.  If a few more minutes had passed, the secrets would have died with us.  As you probably noticed, our names have been cleared.  Excellent work."

10338, "Despite overwhelming odds, the Nepenthe survived the battle intact.  We owe this to the brave pilots who protected our ship in the face of certain death."

10339, "The GTD Nepenthe did not survive the operation.  Our beloved crew and captain will be sorely missed."

10340, "Make sure you protect the Nepenthe from the bomber wing, and work quickly to take out the dish once the shield is down."

10341, "With the destruction of the enemy fighters and the cruisers, we snuffed out the last flame of the mercenary rebellion."

10342, "Although it would have been nice to destroy the last mercenary cruisers, they shouldn't be too difficult to find and eliminate."

10343, "Try to take out both the White Dwarf and the Red Giant before you leave."

10344, "Your team's disabling of the weapons subsystem made it much easier for our strike squad to take down the GTD Trinity.  Good work."

10345, "As a side note:

Admiral Darcy, despite years of admirable service, had become a great threat to humanity.  Had he returned, he would have surely been executed for high treason.  He sold out his own species for personal gain.  Thank you for saving Terran taxpayers millions of credits."

10346, "Good for you for staying around and going that extra, macabre mile :)"

10347, "We failed to achieve communications with GTA Command.  Our names will be forever know only as traitors.  The Vasudans are sure to colonize Mandala Prime for themselves. "

This is Admiral Majanoja, commanding officer of the GTD Destiny.  The Galactic Terran Alliance wishes to issue a formal apology to Captain John Wallace and the crew of the Nepenthe.  This ship and its brave crew managed to unravel a conspiracy which stemmed from one of the highest ranked officers in the GTA Navy, Admiral Darcy.  Commendations to the fine men and women aboard the Alexander Bell who conducted the investigation with the Nepenthe.  Further, the GTA forgives their capital-ship killing Special Ops unit for going AWOL.  The remaining stolen cruisers were destroyed along with the GTD Trinity and its commanding officer, Admiral Darcy."

10400, "Vasudan Update

Apparently, the Vasudan Empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime.  Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded.  The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destiny has already begun evacuation of non-essential personnel."

10401, "Mandala Prime

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

10402, "War?

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were creating a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

10403, "Greetings, pilots, this is Commander Clive Caldwell, squadron leader of the GTD Destiny.  The Nepenthe will stay in Beta Cygni for repairs while you jump ahead to Manda and meet the rest of the fleet.  You will be accompanied by Beta, Delta, Apocalypse, the Destiny, and the Steel."

10410, "I'm aware of how you feel right now.  You may be asking yourself how anyone can fly out of an engagement like this with their lives.  Protect the destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

10411, "Congratulations, pilot.  You accomplished your goals and managed to survive one of the most deadly engagements in the history of Terran galactic war.  Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

10412, "The GTD Destiny, our most important flagship, managed to survive the battle.  This ship will be of invaluable assistance to our front-line efforts, and hopefully, one day, our colonization of Mandala Prime."

10414, "The only real threat to the Destiny is the bomber group Virgo.  Take this wing out and the Destiny should survive."

10415, "The Steel and its brave crew which threw itself at the Phoenix, survived the battle.  This is due largely in part to the fighters who protected it.  Well done."
