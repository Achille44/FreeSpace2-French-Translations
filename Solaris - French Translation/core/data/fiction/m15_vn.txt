MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Okay. I've had my ear to the ground listening to newsfeeds and contacts in the merchant guilds. The general gist is that short of military convoys, commerce in Sulsian space is no longer feasible." 5117 "15a-01"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "One in four transports aren't making it to their destinations. The Albans have withdrawn all of their convoy escorts for fleet duty. Same with the Jacobins, and the Rhenish." 5118 "15a-02"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The Sulsians are running out of ships. They don't have enough to cover the trade lanes and fight the Malikans at the same time." 5119 "15a-03"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "I know it feels like we're abandoning Sulsia, but we're not equipped to fight a war. We'll have to come back when things settle down." 5120 "15a-04"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The Vicare system is looking like our best bet. It's the only supply hub in the region, so it's going to be a magnet for anyone fleeing the war zone." 5121 "15a-05"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Vicare is a border system, and it's the last port of call out of Sulsian space. Refugee and freight convoys have been gathering there over the past few days." 5122 "15a-06"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "There'll be a chance to pick up a few escort jobs, and it's far enough away from the Malikan front that it's stable for now." 5123 "15a-07"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Something just came up. Ross has requested we divert to Kotus Anchorage, a Sulsian industrial hub. A large Malikan strike force is enroute and there's some civilians that need help." 5124 "15a-08"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Kotus is the site of an Alban Commonwealth embassy. The facility is evacuating its entire staff, and the transports need escorting out of the area." 5125 "15a-09"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "They've sent out a call for assistance to secure the evacuation against a likely Malikan attack." 5126 "15a-10"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The evacuation is being hampered by heavy crowds. Thousands of people at the Anchorage are trying to get out of the system." 5127 "15a-11"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The transports are short-ranged and don't have intersystem hyperspace impellers. The Alban Commonwealth has dispatched the heavy transport Elgin to a rendezvous point in the system." 5128 "15a-12"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Other evacuations are taking place elsewhere in the system. The Elgin will be taking on passengers from these operations as well." 5129 "15a-13"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "I know we've already made the decision to leave, so I wanted to run it past everyone first. Do we leave Sulsia now or do we help these Alban civilians first?" 5130 "15a-14"
