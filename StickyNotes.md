# Sticky notes

This file is here to gather all my choices regarding the different translations, so that all my translations have the same rules.

## Translation choices

I choose not to translate the name of the ships and class of ships.
I choose not to translate the name of the medals.
I choose to translate the name of the factions and governments, but not their acronym. So most of the time (especially at the beginning of a campaign), I add the acronym in brackets after the translation of the name. I choose to keep the original acronyms otherwise it would involve changing the acronyms of the ships, which makes no sense (USS Arizona is not translated to NEU Arizona in real life...).

## Dictionnary
I will put some translations choices here for the cases where no exact translations can be made.
This can help in case I find these words elsewhere later.

Barracks = Quartiers
Beam cannons = Canons à photons

## Rank translation

For the translation of the ranks, I decided to translate using the ranks of the French Navy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranks_in_the_French_Navy

Ensign = Enseigne => Enseigne de vaisseau de 2e classe
Lieutenant Junior Grade => Enseigne de vaisseau de 1e classe
Lieutenant => Lieutenant de vaisseau
Lieutenant Commander => Capitaine de corvette
Commander => Capitaine de frégate
Captain => Capitaine de vaisseau
Commodore / Rear Admiral, lower half => Non-existent in France, so let's cheat and shift next ranks... ==> Contre-Amiral
Rear Admiral => Contre-Amiral ==> Vice-Amiral
Vice Admiral => Vice-Amiral ==> Vice-Amiral d'escadre
Admiral => Amiral
