MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "Ross, I've got good news. Master Badami of the logistics ship Hopewell has contacted me with an interesting project." 5174 "16a-23"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "I don't know the full details, but it looks like the Hopewell is in the process of being converted into a light carrier. Vicare yards have already started the workup." 5175 "16a-24"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "Master Badami has asked me to help train the crew in strikecraft maintenance. In return he's loaned us two Warden fighters from the Hopewell's strikecraft complement." 5176 "16a-25"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "If you're not familiar with Wardens, they are decent heavy fighters. They're cannons only, but are a lot more agile than the Comet missile gunships." 5177 "16a-26"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "The only issue is the guns overheat with prolonged fire. However, if you time your fire right they can do a lot of damage to anything in front of them." 5178 "16a-27"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "Like the gunships, I've modified them to accept modular primary cannon banks. You'll be able to fit one bank of light kinetics and one bank of medium cannons." 5179 "16a-28"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "I've kept them in storage in the Vicare Station hangars alongside your gunships, but we should be able to bring them along to the Hoshi's next sortie." 5180 "16a-29"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "As usual, let me know ahead of time so I can make the necessary arrangements." 5181 "16a-30"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 5066 "If you need to find me, I'll be on the Hopewell running deck training. See you soon." 5182 "16a-31"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Looks like our reputation precedes us. I've been approached by Reverend Lightowler of the survey vessel Pillar of Fire. He's been running the Children of Renewal operations here at Vicare." 5183 "16a-32"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Lightowler wants an escort for a mission out near the edge of the Pallavian Veil. If you're not familiar with the Veil, the closest border is at least twenty light years from here." 5184 "16a-33"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "So it's definitely not a small journey, but we've got the time. The Hoshikuzu is fully repaired but the Vicare yards report Nassau will still need at least a week." 5185 "16a-34"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I'm not sure if you've ever been there. It's a huge multisystem nebula around a star cluster. The radiation and gravity makes it a volatile area of space." 5186 "16a-35"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "It's a long way away from colonised space and far out of the way of major transit lanes. I'm not expecting any trouble, but I wouldn't want to sail through the Veil without a good astrogation suite." 5187 "16a-36"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I haven't seen any ship like the Pillar of Fire before. She looks...pretty unique. Her master assures me that her astro equipment is up to specification." 5188 "16a-37"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I don't know what Lightowler plans to do out in the Veil, but it seems like an easy enough job. The Renewal are planning to take the Sulsian refugees to the Covenant system in a few days to meet up with their congregation." 5189 "16a-38"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Lightowler wants the survey mission finished before they move out. He seemed to think this part was important." 5190 "16a-39"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I'll round up the rest of the Hoshi's crew. We sail in two hours." 5191 "16a-40"
