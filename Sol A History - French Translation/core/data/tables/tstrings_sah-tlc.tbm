4681, "The Great War"

4682, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

Evidently, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

4683, "Subspace"

4684, "In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

4685, "Shivans"

4686, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

4690, "Advanced Terran bombers will be equipped with special abilities. Familiarizing yourself with them can be the key to success in bombing missions."

4691, "Many GTVA citizens believe the Security Council could have avoided war with the EA, and protest against the war effort."

4692, "When flying a bomber and a pesky Claymore is on your tail, you may need a wingman to get it off your back."

4693, "The Vasudans are currently sitting out the war, and the EA has no designs on their territory."

4694, "After barely winning control of Sol in a costly war started by the Jovians, the EA is naturally militaristic and distrusting."

Low Energy Usage
Kinetic Weapon

4706, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

4710, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

4713, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

4714, "Designed as a special-issue upgrade to the standard Prometheus, the Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity.  These advances come at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption, but many pilots feel that the tradeoff yields a net benefit.  This weapon's deployment is currently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions."

4719, "The GTW-5a Prometheus R is a modified version of the original Prometheus weapon.  With the link to Earth severed, the GTVA had been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of argon (a required element in the Prometheus's power-generation module) to continue to manufacture the standard Prometheus.  GTVA engineers modified the original design to incorporate some of the advanced electromagnetic mechanisms of the Banshee.  The technology has not been perfected, however, and the Prometheus R suffers from a long recharge cycle and high energy requirements."

4720, "Banshee"

4721, "GTW-7 Banshee"

4722, "Special Issue
EM Weapon
Very High Energy Usage
Extreme Shield Damage"

4723, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

4724, "Railgun"

4726, "Prototype
HiVel Weapon
Long Recharge Cycle"

4727, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

The Dikastes is the most unique of the Transjovian warships fielded by the Earth Alliance to date.  The Dikastes is a sophisticated unit that specializes in long-range surgical strikes using its destroyer-grade spinal beam cannon.  Our analysts believe that Dikastes is in fact, a Soter or Proxenos mainframe reworked to house a massive reactor directly linked with with beam cannon and unique stabilizer device. Displaying obvious similarities to Apothess-class destroyers, Dikastes seems to be a result of reverse-engineered vasudan technology scanned during Alliance's siege on the Ishtar installation utilizing GVD Sebek. It remains unknown for us how TransJovians managed to reproduce it so fast, and significantly decrase size of the whole device. Dikastes is an extremely dangerous threat to Alliance vessels. Capable of bristling all of her firepower from 11,5 clicks, a wing of Dikastes cruisers is capable of neutralizing a destroyer-grade targer as efficiently as infamous, opening salvo of Lindos class destroyers and remain beyond range of any potential backlash fire. Despite being armed in decent point defence screen, main drawback of Dikastes is her vulnerability to fighter and bomber strikes. Focusing device is extremely large and produce enormous amount of radiation, so all of the components had to be installed outside the ship. Additionally such large beam weapon needs to radiate all the heat directly into space making it's core systems exposed. Those features should be compensated by GTVA's strike units. Without her main beam Dikastes is a minimal threat, but TjD seems to be very protective about warships of this class, and often deploying multiple wings of fighters to protect Dikastes class warships. Very few examples were ever encountered. This fact lead our analysts to conclusion, that Dikastes is a prototype warship deployed in limited numbers to evaluate both the ship and subspace focusing technology for beam weaponry. "

5154, "THE FOLLOWING IS CLASSIFIED AND STRICTLY FOR EARTH ALLIANCE PERSONNEL ONLY. REVEALING THE CONTENTS OF THIS BRIEF TO UNAUTHORISED CIVILIANS IS PUNISHABLE BY INCARCERATION AND EXECUTION FOR TREASON.

During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper-hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of a fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and promptly dismissed.

The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Just over fifty years ago, the SD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN fleet that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work.

With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began.

The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over thirty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed.

We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come."

5248, "Hunter"

5249, "EAM-5 Hunter"

5250, "Heat-Seeking Missile
Fire and Forget
High-Yield warhead
"

5251, "Hunters are heat seeking missiles with a somewhat heavy punch. They have a phased explosive charge which is far more effective against hulls than shields. Enemy craft need to keep their shields as fully charged as possible to avoid easy destruction at the hands of the Hunter.  Its very heavy hull damage can devastate most enemy strike craft once their shields are gone."

5252, "Warrior"

5253, "EAM-23 Warrior"

5254, "Standard Issue
Aspect Seeking
High-Yield warhead
"

5255, "The Warrior aspect-seeking missile is the main secondary armament of all EA fighters. Striking a good balance of speed, maneuverability and aspect lock time. The Warrior can consistently strike bombers, and is accurate against fighters when launched from a favourable angle.  A few salvos of Warriors are always bound to do damage."

5256, "Halberd"

5257, "EAM-28 Halberd"

5258, "Heavy Missile
High-Yield warhead
"

5259, "The Halberd is the EA's all-purpose long range missile. This weapon has multiple concussion cluster warheads which can instantly break a wing's formation by scattering closely knit ships away from the point of detonation. Although not too damaging, the blast force can severely disrupt a co-ordinated assault."

5260, "Stinger"

5261, "EAM-42A Stinger"

5262, "Standard Issue
Swarm Missile
"

5263, "Stingers are the smaller-scale version of the T9 swarm missile systems carried on EA capital ships. Although not as damaging as the platform version, Stingers are slightly faster and disorient the target, allowing it to be taken out by other friendly units supporting the attack. Enemy pilots need to take extra care when this devastating weapon is used against them in combat."

5264, "Stiletto III"

5265, "GTM-43B Stiletto III"

5266, "The GTM-43B Stiletto III is the third generation of the Stiletto bomb. A high-yield focused electromagnetic weapon, it is most effective against subsystems. Stilettos are used by Jovian forces to disable important, heavily shielded targets like sensor modules and beam turrets."

5267, "Penetrator"

5268, "EAM-96 Penetrator"

5269, "The result of many generations' improvement on the GTA's original Stiletto anti-subsystem weapon, the Penetrator is almost identical in function to the old Stiletto. However, the Penetrator is a considerably smaller weapon. The caveat to this, of course, is a lower anti-subsystem effectiveness per warhead, but it does mean that EA fighters can more easily take out lightly shielded systems such as cruiser turrets with less expenditure."

5270, "Eviscerator"

5271, "EAM-209 Eviscerator"

5272, "Standard Issue
Area Effect
Fighter Suppresion Weapon"

5273, "A delivery unit that launches 30 smaller heat seeking swarm missiles forward in a twenty degree cone two seconds after launch, the Eviscerator showers targets with death. Usually installed on the Claymore Mk. II, this innovative device is far more effective than the ancient Synaptic cluster weapon it is based on. Fortunately the heat-seekers are fairly easy to throw off, but at close range this may be impossible."

5274, "A.C.R"

5275, "EAM-12 Anti-Cruiser Rocket"

5276, "Special Issue
Very High Payload"

5277, "The A.C.R is a high-yield cluster delivery system that releases several smaller submunitions on detonation. It has no homing ability and no remote detonator, and so must be carefully aimed by the launching vessel."

5278, "Hellstorm"

5279, "EAM-126E Hellstorm"

5280, "Standard Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Multiple Warheads
"

5281, "Hellstorm is the designation of the EA's current anti-cruiser bomb. It is slightly more destructive than the Tsunami, and uses multiple microfusion warheads per bomb to increase damage."

5282, "Hellfire"

5283, "EAM-109B Hellfire"

5284, "Special Issue
Anti-Capital Ship Weapon
Multiple Warheads"

5285, "The Hellfire torpedo packs the EA's anti-destroyer warhead. A technological derivative of the old GTA Harbinger, this weapon uses multiple fusion warheads to increase its destructive capability."

With this increased strength the Alcaeus is better suited for engaging bombers that are near hostile capital ships.  Developed by the Neptunian science colony amongst other advanced technologies, the Alcaeus is used primarily by the UNU but has also been sold to other hostile governments.

The Alcaeus is a Class B threat."

Far larger than its original counterpart, the Ethon has over twice the number of turrets of the Fenris and Leviathan and is capable of mounting multiple missile turrets.  The Ethon was developed on Mars as a means to leverage the large investments already made in Fenris tooling and manufacturing facilities but also to provide a modern and capable cruiser design. Ethons have been sold to many governments in the Solar System, as have licenses to manufacture the cruiser. "

5544, "GTGs Skjoldr (Assault)"

5545, "The Assault Skjoldr (or Heavy Skjoldr) is a refit of the standard model Skjoldr Gunship, originally optimised to eliminate Vasudan capital ships. Although the Assault Skjoldr retains the paired, rotating light Fusion Mortar turrets of the normal gunship, its offensive anti-ship are augmented by a magazine of forty antiship missiles feeding eight independent torpedo launchers. Although limited in endurance thanks to its relatively small magazine, and completely reliant on friendly fighters or escorting capital ships to provide anti-fighter cover, the Assault Skjoldr is capable of delivering a great deal of damage."

5546, "GTGs Skjoldr"

5547, "The Skjoldr Gunship was originally deployed only twelve months before the commencement of hostilities with the Vasudans. Equipped with a pair of rotating light Fusion mortar turrets, its anti-ship damage output is comparable to that the main weapon of a Fenris cruiser, although its considerably smaller magazine means that, in ship to ship combat, its endurance may be an issue. However, though equipped to tackle Vasudan capital ships, the primary mission of the Skjoldr is anti-fighter. Its port and starboard batteries of heat seeking missiles are optimised to engage small strikecraft, both in defence of larger vessels and in offensive roles.  Production of a modified version of the original Skjoldr Gunship has been resumed on Mars.  It can be assumed that it will have found its way into the hands of other governments hostile to the GTA."

First sighted at the last battle of the 2340 Inner Colonies War observing the fighting from a distance, the JCD Majesty boasted several improvements over the original Orion destroyer, though none so radical as the changes implemented in the Tereus.

Although the Majesty was the first, and thus gave its name to the new subclass of destroyer, it would not be the last - even before the formal announcement of the Jovian Coalition of its new toy, it was suspected by many that not only had the Jovians begun work on other destroyers, but also the various other powers had started building their own new destroyers as well.

Worryingly for the GTA, the Majesty marked the change in the rebel powers from 'civilian uprising' to actual independent governments on par with, if not superior to, the Alliance."

The Antaeus is a Jovian attempt to solve that problem, faster and more maneuverable than the Hercules but sacrificing little in armour and shielding. The only major drawback is that the Antaeus has only one secondary bank and so carries far less missiles than the Hercules."

When the destruction of the Lucifer in the Great War caused the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node to collapse, the GTA had several Orion class destroyers in Sol ready to fight the Shivan superdestroyer to the bitter end. Rather than scrap these ships as newer models were built, the Earth Alliance modified the destroyers, fitting them with a second hangar bay to increase their fighter capacity, and replacing the traditional hull armor with the EA's heavier plating. We can also conclude that the EA built a number new ships of this class from scratch, as nine units of this type have been identified in battle so far. As a fleet carrier, the Auriga can carry over 180 combat spacecraft while mounting a number of medium beam and railguns to fend off cruiser and corvette attacks."

5638, "GTI Veles"

5639, "In the earliest days of interstellar travel, trade between systems was relatively limited by the simple expense of access, both to orbital and super-orbital space and to intersystem jump technology. As technology matured, however, and access to space became cheaper, commercial activity and interstellar trade grew rapidly, particularly as colonisation efforts – and later the 14 Year War – saw demand boom. Soon, the requirements of the ballooning trade network threatened to overwhelm the early Endymion class space stations of the time.

The Alliance’s response was two-fold. The first was the acceleration of the design and deployment of the earliest Arcadia class Installations in order to reduce the burden on existing Endymions in the largest populated system. The second was the development of the Veles, a smaller station and supply depot that could serve in a number of roles as a resupply depot, cargo or passenger transfer station or deep space storage facility in populated systems. Some were further adapted to provide refuelling capabilities or for maintenance and repair of the vessels they serviced.

Unlike the larger, more generalist Arcadia, the Veles demonstrates an almost spartan dedication to its role. Where an Arcadia can accommodate thousands, a Veles has an active crew of only a few hundred, and a maximum capacity of under a thousand people. Where an Arcadia has a cavernous fighterbay and was armed to defend itself during wartime, the Veles was very lightly armed (or in many cases entirely unarmed) and used its various landing bays primarily for shuttles, transports and small freighters rather than fighters. Despite these apparent shortcomings, the Veles was considered highly successful in its role, and the simple, robust design rapidly spread across Sol and the newly colonised systems of the GTA."

5723, "The various colonies are being evacuated as we speak. Wings of transports are being loaded with passengers and awaiting the order to scatter. When the Lucifer arrives, those transports will make a run for the Delta Serpentis node and for safety. This way, some lives will be saved.

But the evacuation isn't over yet, and there are still a lot of people down there on that blue planet of ours. And as pilots for the Galactic Terran Alliance's 1st Fleet, the finest and greatest of them all, you will do everything in your power to buy enough time to evacuate each and every one of those civilians."

However, the destruction of the Lucifer in subspace had some... adverse effects on the node. Attempts to send news of the Bastion's task force's success mysteriously failed. Investigation into this revealed the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node to have completely collapsed.

Sol has been cut off from the rest of the Galactic Terran Alliance.

5826, "You will be deployed to $g Luna $g Station, one of our oldest $b Arcadia installations, in orbit around the $b Moon.

5832, "This operation very nearly went horribly wrong, pilot, but thanks to you, the day was saved.

We've also had success across the rest of the system. Civil discontent appears to have quietened down for now, but all GTA staff are to remain on standby in case it erupts again, and suddenly. You never can tell with civilians."

5838, "Your failure to protect the Talos means that Luna Station still resides in the hands of terrorists. This 'victory' has inspired the rest of the Sol system to rioting and open rebellion, which has lead to some very brutal putdowns by GTA forces. This is possibly the beginning of a Sol civil war.

However, you won't be around to see it. Following your failure here, you have been grounded and stripped of your wings. Don't expect to even see a fighter again, civilian."

Do not approach the science convoy with your fighters prematurely - we do not want to spook  them into firing on us."

5934, "Not one single freighter made it out of that engagement alive. While you were surprised by enemy forces larger than you were capable of dealing with, a failure of this magnitude cannot go unpunished. They need somebody to pin this on, and that person is you, pilot.

You've been demoted and reassigned to flying logistical support for 1st Fleet. You won't be seeing any action for a long time yet, pilot. Congratulations are in order, I suppose."

5935, "Leo bombers are your major threat. Take out their bombs, but remember they'll relaunch them if their initial bombs are shot down and they can get in close. Also, don't forget about Pisces wing."

5936, "This engagement shows that perhaps the civil unrest hasn't been suppressed quite as fully as we thought we had. For actual GTA staff to turn traitor to the Alliance is grim news indeed.

However, we have other, bigger problems. The interference of the Crown, the Typhoon and the Cirrus - all civilian craft - in a military operation, and actually firing on military craft... GTA Command believes that we are looking at a full blown rebellion here. If this is true, and the planets are shrugging off the Alliance and acting independently... then the Great War will be nothing compared to the carnage we shall soon see."

5937, "Still, one good piece of news - you managed to save every single freighter under attack. When things go wrong, pilot, it can be difficult to save the situation and prevent things from getting worse. Thanks to you, though, Lambda, Kappa and Iota wings all made it out alive. Excellent flying there, pilot."

5938, "You managed to save the majority of those freighters, pilot. Without sufficient backup and no reinforcements, you still ensured that most of those freighters got back to Earth, where they'll be put to good use. We need all the ships we can get, and also keep morale up as high as we can. Good work."

5939, "Most of the convoy you were charged with protecting didn't make it, pilot. Don't beat yourself up over it, though. You were vastly outnumbered - six fighters against two cruisers and over eight wings - and it's a wonder that you managed to save anyone at all. As it is, you did good to get somebody out alive."

5940, "Although not strictly necessary, it would have been nice if more freighters had survived. Leo bombers are your major threat. Take out their bombs, but remember they'll relaunch them if their initial bombs are shot down and they can get in close. Also, don't forget about Pisces wing."

The 'Jovian Coalition' are to be considered traitors by all GTA personnel, but also a military force to be reckoned with. These aren't just a bunch of pirates - the Jovian colony, like all the others, maintained a separate fleet once. It's only a matter of time before they build it up again."

Despite our many strikes against them, the Jovians still outnumber us greatly, and we haven't even started on the other planets yet.

The attack on Jupiter has been postponed indefinitely.

The deactivation of the $g Terra's jump drives just as it was about to power up and enter subspace caused some kind of malfunction in the drive, meaning the $g Terra has to walk all the way home - figuratively speaking."

6145, "While the Martians were consolidating their strength and regrouping around $r Mars, this was a tolerable situation. However, a few minutes ago, a pair of $r Martian cruisers jumped in behind the $g Terra and began pursuing it at long range. $g Command believes this is the beginning of a rebel assault on the $g Terra."

6147, "We cannot lose that destroyer, pilot. Those rebel wings must be repelled at all costs. The loss of our flagship and destroyer would mean the end of the $g Alliance, especially since after what happened near $r Mars. The $g Terra has already deployed $g Gamma wing to cover it, and $g Command is redirecting some of our defensive cruisers from their posts, but until they arrive, you'll be the $g Terra's only defence. Go!"

6148, "The Terra was destroyed. The flagship of 1st Fleet, our only destroyer and our only advantage over the rebels surrounding us... gone, destroyed by the Martians. This is grave news, pilot. Without the Terra, and with only a few cruisers at our disposal, we are vastly outnumbered. Our destruction is now no longer a question of if, but when."

6149, "Target bomber wings first and foremost. Ignore everything else."

6150, "A Jovian strike force managed to disable the Terra as it was fleeing from Martian space. Soldiers managed to board the destroyer and capture her.

This is terrible news. Not only have we lost our flagship, our only advantage over the rebels, but also our enemies have gained a powerful vessel. The rebels will march on Earth soon, and the sad thing is, the Terra will lead the charge."

6151, "Destroy Libra wing before they can dock. Better yet, don't let the Terra be disabled at all."

6152, "Good job protecting the Terra. Things got pretty intense out there, but you kept the situation under control. Good work.

The Jovian attack is rather disconcerting. It indicates a level of strategic thinking in the Jovian Coalition that surpasses our initial estimates. They are certainly better thinkers than the Martians, who simply wanted to destroy the Terra. All this is a moot point, however, thanks to your timely intervention in their little scheme.

Conversely, the actual opening of fire between Martian and Jovian forces shows that the rebels are not unified in their efforts. This could be extremely useful to us - not only will the rebel fleets' efforts be hindered by their rivals, but also these divides can be exploited by us to ensure our survival."

6153, "The Terra is well on the way back home and the pursuing Martian cruisers pulled off a while ago, so she should be safe. We'll get repairs done on her as soon as possible, but don't expect the Terra to be fully operational any time soon.

Good job, pilot. Losing the Terra would have been a blow the Alliance would not have been able to recover from. Thanks to you, she'll live to fight another day."

Furthermore, the other planetary colonies have declared their independence as well. We are surrounded by enemies on all sides.

So far, we are up against the Mercurian Federation, the Venusian Syndicate, the Republic of Mars, the Jovian Coalition, the United Saturnian States, the Uranian-Neptunian Union, and the Independent Peoples of Pluto. We have a very complicated problem indeed."

6216, "Our first priority is to secure the two planets next to Earth - Venus and Mars. Taking the inner colonies will allow us to crush the Jovian rebellion with no interference. Once the major traitor power has been destroyed, the other planets will capitulate fairly quickly, and Sol will be united once again."

6217, "$r Mars and $r Venus. The two planets next to our home on $g Earth, these two rebel powers have been designated as our next targets by $g GTA $g Command.

Your objective is to destroy these cruisers while they are repairing, rearming and refueling at the installation."

As per the guidelines for $g GTA pilots engaging in combat while there are civilians present, you will NOT fire upon the installation or the civilian craft. They may be rebels, and they may be firing on you, but they are civilians, not soldiers, so keep your guns pointed away from them and watch where your bombs are going.

You have been granted access to $b Harbinger bombs for this operation. While classified anti-destroyer torpedoes, the $b Harbinger will take out cruisers with greater ease than the $b Tsunami. Use them well - and carefully."

Despite being under heavy fire from ships you were not allowed to destroy, you performed admirably and destroyed the Venusian garrison at the installation with great skill. Good job.

Other attacks on the Venusian fleet have gone off without a hitch, leaving their navy in a sorry state of affairs. However, while we would normally push ahead with our advantage here and attack their HQ, reports from the Martian front have been somewhat discouraging. Facing both Martians and Jovians, our already paltry fleet is crumbling away under the pressure.

You're being sent to help shore up the Martian front. The Venusians have been effectively neutered, so we must concentrate our forces on Mars and prevent them from mustering their forces for an attack on Earth."

6228, "The destruction of the Benediction, an Arcadia class installation, could not have been an accident. There is simply no way that station could have been destroyed by anything other than your willfully and intentionally opening fire on it.

For the murder of thousands of innocent civilians, you have been grounded and will be court-martialled at 0900 hours tomorrow. Afterwards, you will be summarily executed for war crimes. Dismissed."

6229, "Destroy only the five cruisers in your Directives and Escort windows."

6230, "One of the civilian craft in the vicinity of the Benediction was destroyed. This operation required precise aiming and an ability to dodge incoming fire, and you were selected for these attributes. However, somehow a civilian ship got caught up in the firefight and was destroyed.

It seems that their attack was more than a mere scouting operation, such as those done by Jovian ships previously sighted around Mars or just an attempt to destroy the facility. This was part of a full-scale invasion of Mars by Jupiter. Normally we would celebrate, seeing as it appears one rebel power has just destroyed another, but Command suspects that the Jovian objective was not simple conquest. You and the rest of 1st Fleet will be briefed on the situation more fully when more information becomes available.

In the meantime, Command has called off all offensive operations on both the Martian and Venusian fronts. For the moment, Command wants us to take a breather while we wait and see what's going on on Mars."

Under orders from Jupiter, the Martian fleet is moving into position for a full-scale attack on Earth. We face several cruiser wings, numerous gunboats and multiple fighter and bomber squadrons.

Suffice to say, 1st Fleet must defend Earth. Against such overwhelming forces, our only comfort is that they have no destroyer to counter the Terra with. However, the Martians do probably have Harbinger bombs amongst their arsenal, which pose a credible threat to the destroyer."

6379, "Your orders, $g Alpha and $g Beta, are to ensure the $g Terra survives and that the attacking rebel fleet is destroyed. It's possible that if we can repel this assault, the rebels simply won't have the manpower to launch another attack, and some kind of peace treaty can be worked out.

Either way, if the $g Terra falls, $g Earth and the $g Alliance are done for."

Or stood for. The Terra was destroyed by the rebel assault. Nothing remains of either 1st Fleet or the GTA, and now Earth is firmly under the thumb of the Jovians.

Normally for deserting the field of battle you would be punished. But with the end of the Galactic Terran Alliance and the imminent execution of all its former staff, I don't really think there's much point."

6382, "Excellent news, pilots, excellent news to match an excellent performance!

Your flying out there ensured our victory and the Terra's survival. If the Terra had gone down, we would have been wide open to attack and the rebels would have been able to just walk in and conquer Earth. But you and the rest of 1st Fleet prevailed and destroyed the attacking rebel fleet.

Speaking of which... the rebel fleet was a rag-tag flotilla of the remaining Martian and Venusian cruisers. Our fleet may have been all but wiped out, but so has theirs. GTA representatives will be meeting up to discuss an armistice with the various rebel governments. Crippled as we all are, none of us are able to continue the fight, and so peace is our only option left.

But you don't have to worry about politics. Just relax and head on down back to Earth. You saved the world and the Alliance. You're a hero now. We all are."

6470, "Pre-emptive Strike"

6471, "I would like to start today's command briefing by extending a warm welcome to all the new pilots that have just joined up with 1st Fleet today! For the past five years, we have been patrolling the area around Earth, ensuring its safety and protection from the rebel threat that flourishes in the rest of the Sol system. I myself have been fighting for the Alliance ever since Operation Thresher, back in the T-V War. Oh, my name's Admiral Johnson, for those of you who don't know already."

6472, "You all know our new leaders have been changing quite a few things around here, namely the scrapping of the GTD Terra and a few dramatic legislative reforms. However, Command has informed me that starting from today, 1st Fleet will be undergoing a massive overhaul, starting with the following..."

6473, "...namely, the GTD Tereus has finally been completed! Engineers have finished their tests and technicians are even now readying the new destroyer for combat.

For those of you who haven't been keeping up, the GTD Tereus is a brand new destroyer straight from the think-tanks of the GTA. Based on the old Orion design, the Tereus class boasts stronger weaponry and armour, and Command hopes that it will lead us to victory over the rebels!"

6474, "That said, our enemies have also not been idle in the time since or last conflict.  Our intelligence reveals that the Martian Republic have been constructing new  Skjoldr class gunships.  The Skjoldr was a small cruiser constructed by the GTA during the T-V war as a complement to the larger Fenris class.  The Martians have likely pressed the class back into service to rapidly grow their fleet strength.  We do not know in what way these ships have been armed or differ from their T-V war ancestors.  We are uncertain what types of fighters you may encounter, but be prepared for anything. "

6475, "Command has authorised us to go ahead with Operation Medusa's Gaze, a series of missions that should clear the air for us and will become the first combat deployment of the GTD Tereus. For those of you who have received messages about this upcoming operation, briefing will begin in fifteen minutes. The rest of you, it's business as usual. Dismissed."

6476, "Hello and welcome to $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze. You have been randomly selected to take part in the $g GTA's first offensive military operation in five years, ever since the near-annihilation of $g 1st $g Fleet and the signing of the $b GTA-Independents peace treaty in 2335."

6477, "A little background knowledge for you - the terms of the peace treaty confine all $g GTA craft to $g Earth and the area immediately around $g Earth. While the rebels have all of $b Sol to run around in, we are not allowed anywhere outside of the region between $r Mars and $r Venus, on pain of war once more."

6478, "To ensure that we kept our side of the bargain, $r Mars and $r Venus set up several border outposts to keep an eye on us. One such outpost, consisting of three Martian gunboats and a small cargo depot, will be the target of the first phase of $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze.  At least one of these vessels appears to be mounted with a powerful radar system."

Get to your ships, pilots, and destroy this outpost utterly. "

6482, "Welcome back, pilot. Your first engagement was a success. This is good to hear - from what I hear from Command, we'll be needing lots of successes if Operation Medusa's Gaze is going to work.

Speaking of which, Command hasn't bothered to inform me what significance the destruction of that outpost has, but that's nothing new. Get used to it, pilot.

Those strange Apollos you encountered seem to be a new class of Martian manufactured fighter.  We have provisionally designated these ships as $quoteGTF Latona$quote.  They appear to be superior to the old type, but their exact characteristics are unknown.

The Republic of Mars has understandably reacted with outrage at the mysterious disappearance of one of their monitoring outposts, but since there's nothing official to directly link the GTA to the raid, there's nothing they can do.

And before you ask, Command does know it is endangering the previous administration's peace treaty with the rebels. I don't know what they're up to, but it'll probably be for the best anyway."

6483, "It is unfortunate that you were unable to destroy the Martian freighters. While they were only civilians, they were traitors to the Alliance and deserved to die. Still, don't worry about it. You had other, more important things to worry about at the time.  At least it seems that they could not provide the Republic of Mars with hard evidence of our involvement, or that the Martian government is not willing to escalate our attack into full scale war just yet."

The station we will be targeting is the $r RMR $r Scabbard. The cruisers are the $r Warrior, the $r Paladin and the $r Cavalier.  The $r Warrior is one of the new Martian Ethon class cruisers.

Unlike the Republic of Mars, who have not responded well to the destruction of another of their stations and one of their cruiser wings as well. Strangely enough, Command does not appear to be worried about the threats of war coming from Mars.

They have called off any further attacks against Martian forces, however. But if they think that'll be enough to prevent a war with Mars, then they're mistaken.

Both myself and Command want you to remain on standby, just in case. In the meantime, I don't want you discussing any aspect of Operation Medusa's Gaze, or what little you've seen of it, with anyone - civilian OR soldier. Got it?"

6703, "The time has come for the assault on $r Mars. The monitoring stations on the border between $r Mars and $g Earth... the secondary refuel-and-resupply bases... the $r Romulus and $r Remus command posts have all been destroyed. All that remains is $r Mars itself, and the seat of the $r Republic $r of $r Mars - the $r Fortress installation."

6704, "The war that took place five years ago was just as devastating to the $r Martian fleet as it was to ours... they recovered sooner and more so than we did - thanks to their relatively pristine planet and the nearby asteroid belt - but our strikes against their cruisers have left them with a force only slightly larger than ours... and we have the $g Tereus to give us the advantage."

6705, "You will accompany the $g Tereus into position nearby the $r Fortress installation. The $r Republic will be given the opportunity to surrender. If they do not take it, then you will destroy them.

We will take $r Fortress station, pilots - by force or by negotiations, $r Mars will be ours once again."

6706, "The Martians managed to destroy the Tereus. That destroyer was our only real playing piece - without it, we have nothing to fight with. Soon the Martians will regroup and attack Earth like they did five years ago, and this time we won't have a destroyer to stop them with."

6707, "Eliminating some of the cruisers might help you out a bit. Also destroy Leo and Virgo wings quickly before they can launch their bombs."

6708, "Rejoice! The Galactic Terran Alliance has taken Mars back from the rebels! The Red Planet is ours once more, and in the taking of it, we have put an end to the suffocation of Earth that has lasted five years! Now, with the rich and plentiful resources of Mars, we can build more ships, using the advanced technology the Tereus has tried and tested in the campaign against Mars! 1st Fleet will be rebuilt, and the rebels will be sorry they ever dared to turn their backs on Earth!

Excellent job retaking Mars from the rebels, pilot. However, of some concern is the successful evacuation of the more important Republic government officials from Fortress station, along with a small contingent of cruisers and freighters. Command suspects they have gone to meet up with the other rebel powers, but which ones, we don't know.

However, that's not important. The capture of Mars and the destruction of their fleet is. Today is a day that will be celebrated forever by Earth as the day Earth struck back."

The Tereus will garrison Mars, so backup will be provided from elsewhere - namely, the new ships being produced using resources from the Asteroid Belt."

6754, "So far, four new ship classes have been constructed - GTF Claymore fighters, GTB Peregrine bombers, GTC Eclipse cruisers and one more.. These new craft are the latest in space design and technology from the science enclave on Earth. We'll get started on detailing their capabilities in the tech room - but don't think that's all the GTA's got coming. Watch this space."

6755, "The fourth ship is an entirely new creature. Designated a 'corvette' class, the new GTCv Skotas fills in the gap between the cruiser and the destroyer. A corvette is stronger, tougher and more capable than a cruiser, and will be instrumental in securing the inner colonies for the Galactic Terran Alliance."

6756, "The new Shrieker primary weapon serves double duty as both a powerful shield buster like the old GTW-99 Shield Breaker but also serves as a heavy subsystem disruptor.  Three new secondary weapons are also available for our new fighters - Hunters are heat seeking missiles with a phased explosive charge more effective against hulls than shields. Its very heavy hull damage can devastate most enemy strike craft once their shields are gone. The Warrior can consistently strike bombers, and is accurate against fighters when launched from a favourable angle.  A few salvos of Warriors are always bound to do damage. Finally, the Peltast is a replacement for the Fury dumbfire.  All these secondary weapons can be rearmed using the new drone Cycnus support vessel."

6757, "Get down to the flight deck, pilots. We've got an empire to reclaim."

6758, "Congratulations, pilots - as experienced veteran pilots for the $g GTA, you have been specifically chosen to escort the first of our new cruisers, the $g GTC $g Eclipse, on her first mission. Your objectives are twofold - firstly, the capture of a $r Mercurian science cruiser, secondly, the destruction of $r Mercurian fleet assets."

Acquiring it would be a major strategic victory over the $r Mercurian $r Federation, which is why they are guarding it with the $r MFC $r Celerity."

It is likely that the $r Mercurians will send ships to recapture the $r Agility, which is where the second half of this operation comes into play."

6764, "Omega"

6765, "Since it is likely that the $r Mercurians will attempt to recapture the $r Agility, you will continue to escort the $g Eclipse until any reinforcements are destroyed or $g Command dismisses you, whichever comes first. Not only will our efforts be wasted if we let the $r Agility fall back into $r Mercurian hands, but we also cannot allow an opportunity to destroy even more of the rebel scum to go untaken.

Get to your brand-new, top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art ships, pilots. We've got traitors to burn."

6766, "Reinforcements?"

6767, "The Eclipse - the first of our new cruiser class, the foundation for the 1st Fleet of tomorrow - was destroyed. Not only were many lives lost, but our operation to reclaim Mercury was jeopardised as well. This was as a result of your gross incompetency, and so you are hereby discharged from the Galactic Terran Alliance. Dismissed."

6768, "Destroy Virgo wing. Use your Shriekers to take out the cruiser turrets too."

6769, "The Agility was destroyed. The entire point of the operation was to CAPTURE the Agility, not to destroy it. While not a huge blow, it does cast doubt on your abilities, which is why you will now be flying support for 1st Fleet while we attack the Mercurian fleet. Dismissed."

6770, "Don't fire on the Agility with your Avenger cannon. Engage enemies as far away from the science vessel as possible."

6771, "Good work! The control station for the solar panels has been captured, all thanks to you. Not only have we gained a vital strategic asset, and weakened our enemy's position, but we have also demonstrated to the rebel powers the strength of our new ships and technology. Morale can be just as effective a weapon as brute force.

The Tereus will now be leading an assault on the Mercurian fleet. We suspect that complete control of the inner colonies is very nearly within our grasp, and destroying the Mercurians will be the first step towards that goal.

You, however, will not take part in the assault. We have a special treat for you, involving the initial deployment of our new 'corvette' class of ship. Stay posted."

You may not have known it, pilot, but you were taking part in the final battle to secure the inner colonies!

An overview: GTA forces attack Mercury. Two cruisers carrying their leaders escape our attack and flee for Venus. Command, expecting this, puts Operation Hermes into action, sending the first of our new corvettes, the GTCv Skotas, after them. Meanwhile, the Tereus, over in the Asteroid Belt, begins priming its engines.

The Skotas pursues the Mercurian cruisers up to Venus, whereupon the Venusian fleet, eager to save the behinds of their allies, jump in and engage the Skotas. We send in the Tereus, and crush the rebel fleet between our two warships.

This operation was planned out long before the attack on Mercury. Thankfully, the rebels played right into our hands. If they had died to a man, then the assault on Venus would have entailed attacking their cruisers in defended positions, meaning a more costly and more difficult war.

But now's the time to relax and celebrate! The inner colonies have been secured, all thanks to the Skotas, the Tereus, and you. Take some time off. The Alliance won't be needing you until we find the remnants of the Martian fleet."

While we're currently at peace with the outer colonies, don't think you've got an easy ride ahead of you - there's still plenty of stuff for you to do, even in peacetime.

Piracy is at an all time high, so we'll be taking a look at this little problem and seeing what we can do about it. The Asteroid Belt has become a very dangerous place to be, these last few months - which causes us some major problems constructing our forward defence outposts."

7000, "If you happen to have been hiding under a rock these past few years - and by the look of some of you, you have - then you won't know that EA Command has been constructing outposts along the outside of the Asteroid Belt to watch for any Jovian fleet movement towards our planets. Our new Lycaon outposts do a swell job as observer posts and resupply stations for our 'Belt patrol groups. Speaking of which... did I mention there's plenty of stuff for you to do?

Because that's what you're going to do. Patrol."

7001, "Today, pilots, you will be escorting $g Lambda wing freighters to one of our $b Lycaon outposts along the outer fringes of the $b Asteroid $b Belt. These freighters are carrying important construction materials required to finish and properly equip our new installations, so that we can defend against the $r Jovian threat next door. We've been covering their flight through the $b Belt in shifts, and you're up for the final leg."

7003, "Since we remain in a state of 'cold war' with the outer colony rebels, the main threat you will be facing will be from the pirate vessels that ply the $b Asteroid $b Belt looking for freighters to ambush and supplies to steal. You're fresh out of flight school and probably far too trigger happy for your own good, so I'll tell it to you straight - don't fire on any rebel craft you see unless they fire on you. The peace we have right now is fragile and tense, but $g Command isn't prepared to fight another war with the rebs because some rookie couldn't keep his fingers off his targeting reticle, alright?"

7007, "Engage ships at as long a range as possible. Try to avoid fighting near the freighters, as they will get damaged.  Be sure to take out Athenas and Hercs first."

7008, "Good job preserving the cargo from the pirates, pilot. They escaped with only one container. This assault was unexpected, as pirates tend to go for food and water and other supplies, not construction material. Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht. You did well enough for a rookie."

7009, "The pirates escaped with two containers, pilot. This assault was unexpected, as pirates tend to go for food and water and other supplies, not construction material. Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht. You did passably for a rookie, though I certainly expected more."

Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht - I'm sure you won't mind, considering your excellent performance. Once again, good job. We need more people like you out here."

7011, "Remarkably, you kept all of the freighters well protected as well.  The civilian owner of the ships has reached out to me to thank you for your performance."

7012, "You kept two of the freighters on station as well. We'll send a tug to pick up the rest of the cargo and take it to our outposts.  The Justice can keep it covered for now."

The reasons for the attack on the Justice are unknown, but our motivations are crystal clear - defend that corvette at all costs! Now move!"

Don't beat yourself up about it, pilot. You did the best you could. Now, I'm assigning you to guard duty on the inner side of the 'Belt. There are a number of cargo depots there that need watching, and I think you could benefit from the experience. Dismissed."

Again, due to the unusual nature of this attack, I've contacted EAI and informed them of what happened. So far, the current hypothesis is that the original exodus of petty criminals and enemies of the state - which happened just after the Earth Alliance's securing of the inner colonies in 2340 - also contained a number of radical anti-EA remnants of rebel governments, and it is these elements that are leading the attacks on our forces.

We were impressed by your skillful defence of the EACv Justice from a heavy pirate attack, and have selected you and other top pilots for a top secret operation in the outer colonies. This briefing and anything you see, hear or do while working for EAI is and will be classified top secret, violation of which will result in your incarceration and execution."

7147, "The current major superpowers, apart from ourselves, are the Jovian Coalition and the United Saturnian States. These two planets have enough resources to easily counter our own fleet. The Jovians are known to have at least one modified Orion-class destroyer, the JCD Majesty, and the Saturnians are suspected to have one as well. If these two powers ever came together, they could easily dominate this system."

7148, "Thankfully, the two maintain a bitter rivalry. Two other powers remain, however - the Uranian-Neptunian Union and the Independent Plutonian Peoples. The main strength of the UNU is their technological superiority, this being due to their controlling the Neptunian science colony. Again thankfully, they have not turned their innovative prowess to military applications."

7149, "Finally, the Independent Plutonian Peoples - a pitiful excuse for a colony, their entire fleet consists of a few fighter wings and a single Ethon cruiser, the Styx. They continue to exist only on the sufferance of the other powers and by virtue of their weakness.
 
 Our plan is to use the IPP as a cover for a series of strikes against the UNU using old GTA fighter craft. Direct intervention in the area would bring the wrath of the Jovians and Saturnians down on our heads, so you must maintain your disguise during this operation. Disguised as Plutonians, you should be able to do a lot of damage to the UNU before they or the other powers crush the IPP, in which case our ruse will become unworkable. Even so, another power will be crushed and we will be one step closer to a unified Sol."

Although the freighter caravan has a military escort - the $r UNC $r Ahab and two fighter wings - it is mostly made up of civilians.  One of the fighter wing is made up of the UNU's new interceptor, the UNF Alcaeus.  This craft appears to be a better armed and armoured Valkyrie.

7154, "Your cowardice could have cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

During a recent attack by the Jovians on EA space, the Neptunians took the opportunity to test a new weapon, the likes of which have only ever been seen on the SSD Lucifer - photon beam cannons.

If the Lucifer's flux weapons are anything to go by, these new weapons could prove to be that which gives the upper hand to the eventual victor of this conflict. We at EA Command are determined that the Earth Alliance will be those victors, and to do that, we must seize those beam cannons immediately.  The Jovian government is also expected to attempt to seize this technology for itself."

7363, "JOVIAN FLEET UPDATE
Observation of Jovian fleet assets in the previous engagement has allowed intel to provide the summary of their new combat vessels. The Antaeus is a Jovian fighter faster and more maneuverable than the Hercules but has only one secondary bank and so carries far fewer missiles. The Apollyon is an attempt to merge the capabilities of the Athena class with the ability bomber warheads. The Callisto is a new Jovian strike bomber falling in between in between the Apollyon and Medusa in its capabilities. The Hera is a large bomber with six gun mounts. It has a massive afterburner more than capable of doubling its speed. However it carries fewer bombs than the Ursa and it does not have a defensive turret.  Finally, the Jovians have introduced the Soter line of support cruisers. This class is armed with high velocity missile anti-ship missiles, nicknamed 'HVels', which appear to be derived from Jovian observation of our Skotas class. It has replaced the old Fenris and Leviathan cruiser lines in Jovian service."

7364, "The entire EA fleet has been mobilised for this operation. Your C.O.s will give you orders straight from High Command. Brand new Claymore Mark II heavy assault fighters are being shipped out to your vessels as they come off the production lines. Available for use with these heavy fighters is the latest in advanced weaponry - the EAW-162 Trantor cannon, the EAM-96 Penetrator anti-subsystem missile and the EAM-42A Stinger missile. Like the original Prometheus upon which it was based, the Trantor does tremendous damage to armor, although it does less well against heavy shielding. The Penetrator replaces the old Stiletto with a smaller weapon which can be carried in larger numbers for great effect against enemy turrets.  Lastly, the Stinger swarm missile improves greatly on the old Hornet and is absolutely lethal to fighters and bombers.
 
 Let nothing stand in your and the Earth Alliance's way. We must have those beam cannons!"

You may remember the attack on the $g Justice by pirate forces some time ago. The exact motivations for the pirate assault remain a mystery to us, although we have our suspicions. However, we wish to lift the fog before us, and you will be our lantern bearer."

7426, "EA"

7427, "A possible location where we might find out this information is one of the many pirate 'bases' scattered through the $b Asteroid $b Belt - however, they tend to be hidden well, and are typically guarded by a dense belt of mines.  Pirate ships are equipped with a device which deactivates those mines which are nearby to permit them to travel to and from their bases. Attempting to clear these mines would be costly and inefficient, and we cannot jump through the asteroids to the vicinity of a pirate base without a precise set of coordinates. Thus, we must use the pirates themselves to lead us through the minefields to their homes."

7428, "Macavity"

7429, "We have selected the $r Macavity, a pirate cruiser not particularly renowned for their competence, as the focus for this operation. $g EAI forces will attack the $r Macavity and cause her to flee. One of our operatives will then follow the $r Macavity through the $b Asteroid $b Belt and its minefields to one of the pirate bases.

You will be that operative."

7430, "You will follow the cruiser through the $b Asteroid $b Belt until the $r Macavity reaches a pirate base - at all times maintaining a distance of 500 metres to avoid detection. The $b Asteroid $b Belt will mask your engine signature, but a direct visual by the pirates will blow the operation. The Macavity disables any mine within 1000 meters of her.  You therefore must also not stray more than that distance away from her, either.  Once the $r Macavity has led you to the base, and you have made the correct subspace vector calculations, we will then deploy a task force to capture the base and discover more about these pirates. "

7431, "You have been assigned the Claymore Mk III for the operation.  This variant of the Claymore platform falls in between the original Claymore and Claymore Mark II in combat effectiveness.  It is equipped with an advanced sensor pod that will allow us to establish the best subspace vector for our task force should we need to display it. Remember, a visual sighting of the pirate base is not enough.  We need that subspace vector! We will keep you updated throughout the mission, pilot. Dismissed."

7432, "Your cowardice cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

7433, "I'm not sure whether you picked this one up or not, pilot, but this was a STEALTH MISSION! Whether it was due to gross incompetence or outright treachery, I don't know, but you FOULED up the operation BIG TIME! I'll decide what to do with you later, now get out of my sight!"

7434, "Don't fire anything until the Macavity has led you to the pirate base. Don't get too close to anyone."

7435, "You were unable to keep up with the Macavity as it fled through the Asteroid Belt. This is most disappointing, pilot. I had expected you to be able to cope with a mission of this simplicity, but evidently you are not as competent as I originally thought.

A second attempt will be made in a few days - however, we will not be calling on you for the honour again. Our next meeting will be the one in which I decide your fate. Dismissed."

7436, "Don't let anyone scare you too far away from the Macavity. You have three axes to play in - use them well."

7437, "The destruction of the task force sent to destroy the pirate base is more than disappointing, pilot. If we cannot even destroy a rag-tag band of petty criminals, what hope do we have against the might of the Jovian navy?

The details of the mission have proved troubling to EA Command. Unfortunately, due to your handling of said mission, you are no longer cleared to hear exactly what that means. We'll discuss your failure and the consequences it shall have on your career later, pilot. For now, dismissed."

7438, "Virgo and Leo are top priority. Remember to assign Delta and Gamma to attack the Monarch and the Lambert before they can do too much damage to the Alexander."

7439, "This is most troubling, pilot. If the Jovians are in league with the pirates, as the presence of the Monarch seems to indicate, then we have a major political problem - not even considering the question of a powerful military force lurking in the depths of the Asteroid Belt, so very close to our homes on Mars and Earth.

I do not expect you to be concerned with such matters, however. You performed satisfactorily out in the field, successfully tailing the Macavity in a solo operation and then joining in on the attack on the pirate base. I am pleased, pilot. You have shown yourself to be a pilot worthy of EAI status.

EAI wishes to put this matter of the Jovian-pirate alliance on the back burner for a moment, and I wish to do the same with your career. Do not take it amiss, pilot - it is just that now is the time for spies and saboteurs, not for commando raids by the likes of yourself. And although the findings of today's little operation shall remain secret for the time being, your time here at EAI is not at an end.

We have numerous top-secret facilities that our pilots, while they are not serving our cause deep behind enemy lines, guard and keep top secret. You and your squad will be guarding such facilities, as until we require your services once again. Again, as with this Jovian matter, this may not rise up for some time - months, even years or decades. But it will do so eventually.

We'll be in touch."

The EAD Tereus has been destroyed. While she was on a routine sweep of the Asteroid Belt, a heavy pirate attack force attacked and destroyed her. This is a great loss to us all - the Tereus was the flagship of the Earth Alliance and carried many fine pilots. Now that it has been destroyed, and with the EAD Heliades still under construction, our firepower has been greatly reduced. We will miss Admiral Werner greatly."

7539, "We are now the flagship of the Earth Alliance. The Arethusa will now take the place of the Tereus, and the EAD Resolute will take the Arethusa's place backing us. In the meantime, we are to sweep the Asteroid Belt for pirates and destroy them once and for all. The treacherous monsters will live to regret their attack on the Tereus!"

7540, "Our first task must be to locate the escape pods that launched from the $g Tereus. Reports from our forces guarding the $g Tereus shortly before her death said that nine escape pods managed to launch from the destroyer and get out into the $b Asteroid $b Belt. We must find those escape pods and bring them home."

When you do find the escape pods, you will escort them to the jump out point at the centre of the battlefield. If pirate raiders show up to pick over the remains of the $g Tereus, you may have to defend the pods against them.

Suit up, pilot. The $g EA needs you right now."

7542, "Your inability to defend ANY of the escape pods from the Tereus is a damning blow to the EA and your career, pilot. We are on the verge of fighting a massive war on multiple fronts, pilot, and we need all the men we can get. However, due to your incompetency, the surviving crew of the Tereus were massacred by pirate forces.

Think about how many people you let die today, pilot. You'll be doing a lot of thinking where you're going."

7543, "Engage the enemy as far away from the escape pods as possible."

7544, "You managed to save a number of the Tereus' escape pods. You did fairly well, for a rookie.

It is likely that we will be pursuing the pirate question with EAI assistance. As we are - now - the oldest and most experienced crew in the EA fleet, we will be the ones taking the murderous pirates head on. Be prepared for further action, pilots."

We suspect the pirates maintain a central base of operations, an installation where they manufacture the weapons and ships that they use.

Standard EA procedure dictates that all pilots involved are demoted and reassigned to less strenuous tasks. You are one of those pilots. You have been given the post of convoy escort for transports travelling from Venus to Mercury and back again.

There have been... developments, developments which, with your current level of clearance, I cannot tell you about. Suffice to say that it appears, due to your incompetence, that you are a liability out here on the front lines, and thus you have been moved elsewhere. Dismissed, pilot."

7670, "Be sure to take out the Petrograd's rail turrrets quickly. Also, be aware of the dangers of the Petrograd's missile turret facing the Zealous and surprise attacks later on in the mission. Either save your Penetrators or remember to call in a support ship and rearm."

7671, "Excellent job, pilot. The Earth Alliance has annihilated the pirate threat once and for all, and the Tereus has been avenged. Any remaining pirates will be quickly mopped up by EA forces moving to the front lines.

Yes, that's right, pilot. The 'Belt is now the front lines in a war that's been simmering away for over thirty years. EAI has confirmed the presence of Jovian ships at the pirate installation, showing that the Jovians were supplying and encouraging the pirate attacks on the Earth Alliance. The commissars have given the go-ahead for the EA to declare war against the Jovian Coalition in retaliation for the underhanded acts of aggression via their pirate proxies.

Our engineers have delivered a new weapon just in time for this new conflict - the EAW-62b Aratrum.  This is a close range shotgun type weapon that can chew up bombers and larger vessels with ease. 

Even as we speak, the declaration of war should be being received in Throne Installation right now. What the Jovian response will be is unknown, but EA High Command has made it clear - this is war in Sol again, and this time, it shall be the last."

7795, "The $g Lindos cannot wait forever, pilot - its current position is obvious to all and leaves it open to assault from $r UNU cruiser wings, so sooner or later it will have to jump in and attack the $r Tempest. Try and disarm the $r Tempest before that happens, pilot."

7796, "The ultimate goal of this operation, pilot, is the destruction of all $r UNU forces near $r Neptune. Whatever happens with the $g Lindos and the $r Tempest's main guns, your primary objectives are the destruction of the $r UNU's command ship, the $r Tempest, and the $r destruction of all $r UNU ships in the area.

Suit up, pilot. We're on a timer here."

Your failure is most disappointing, pilot. You will be brought up before a military tribunal in a few weeks, where you will be given your punishment. Expect, at the very least, expulsion from the ranks of the EA and imprisonment for several years for crimes of gross negligence. Dismissed."

7798, "You have to move quickly to disarm the Tempest's beams. Go for the ones facing the Lindos first, then tackle the rest. Also, when the cruisers attack the Lindos, the Harpoon cruiser is a priority target - take it out first, then go for the other ships."

7799, "A stunning victory for the Earth Alliance! This first strike bodes well for our offensive!

The destruction of the Atlantis has had two benefits - firstly, Neptune is no longer under UNU control. Secondly, with one full half of their union gone, the UNU has been seriously weakened and we are hoping for terms of surrender from the Uranians coming through over the next few days."

Thanks to your efforts, however, it is seriously weakened - replacing its destroyed beam cannons should take some time, hopefully more time than the UNU have available. Anyway, good job with that, pilot."

Your task shall be to protect both of these ships while they make their assault. Focus on fighters and bombers - the destroyers will handle the capital ship combat. The Constant has already suffered damage in a previous engagement.  Be sure neither she nor the Eternity escape. Dismissed."

7897, "The destruction of not only one of our major capital ships, but also the flagship of the Earth Alliance, is a greivous blow, both in terms of the loss of men and firepower, and also in terms of morale. Your failure today cost us the mission, the Lindos and Saturn - Hourglass station remains in the hands of the USS, and so does the rest of the planet.

For your failure here today you are hereby dismissed from active service in the Earth Alliance pending a re-evaluation of your skills and abilities. Until then, you'll be spending your time back on Earth. Dismissed, pilot."

7898, "You need to take out both cruiser groups as quickly as possible - consider splitting your team up to take them both out. Also, you need only destroy the main beam cannon on each of the cruisers in order to save the destroyers - you can blow them up later."

Unfortunately, once again, the rebels have made their escape. The leaders of the USS fled to Jupiter on board the USD Eternity. There, they will reinforce the Jovian position.

This is This is regrettable, pilot, but at least we can claim a moral victory - the rebels are packing up and fleeing from their homes. The EA juggernaut of war is unstoppable, and the only hope for the rebs is to run away like the cowardly dogs they are. Soon, they will have nowhere to run to.

Our fleet has started to converge on Jupiter. The day after tomorrow, the attack will commence. The Jovian Coalition's time has almost run out."

8053, "During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of an entire fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and was promptly dismissed."

8054, "The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Almost forty years ago, the SSD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN ship that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work."

8055, "With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began."

8056, "The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over twenty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed."

8057, "We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come."

8058, "The campaign is nearly over. An attempted strike by the Jovian fleet was swiftly put down with the destruction of the JCD Empress. Only three destroyers remain - the JCD Majesty, the JCD Imperial and the USD Eternity. They and whatever are left of the rebels are no match for the Earth Alliance, not with the EASD Nemesis on station. With their destruction, the Sol system will finally be united once more, but this time under the rule of the Earth Alliance, and this time we shall never let go."

Succeed, and you will be a hero. Fail, and our wrath will know no boundaries. Is that understood?

Get to your ships, pilots. Victory awaits."

8064, "Your incompetence forced the Nemesis to be withdrawn, pilot. Thankfully, although a grievous blow to the EA, it has not completely negated our attack - unlike YOU, other forces have managed to capture several key Jovian positions, including Io, Callisto and Europa.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.

I simply cannot emphasise just how many people lost their lives when you allowed that superdestroyer to be destroyed, pilot. Your performance was not only unacceptable according to the standards of the Earth Alliance fleet - EA High Command itself has personally issued a warrant for your execution for gross negligence to the point of high treason. Popular opinion is vastly in favour of having you put to death immediately, but we here like to take things a little more slowly than that. Dismissed."

8067, "Bombs and bombers are always priority targets. Ditto beam cannons on the destroyers."

8068, "A truly inspiring performance there, pilot. You defended the Nemesis, flagship of the Earth Alliance fleet, from bomber attack, rebel destroyers AND a cunning trap, with no concern for your own survival, and thus ensured the victory of the EA over the last of the rebels. Tremendous job!

This is, of course, the end of the war. The only power in the Sol system now is the Earth Alliance - but we do not stand unchallenged. Rebellious undercurrents of society may seek to overturn and destroy all that we hold dear at any moment... plus, there is still the matter of whatever lurks in the shadows of Delta Serpentis...

The Shivans are still out there, pilot, and one day we shall have to face them.

But with the Nemesis on station, both fears of Shivan invasion and civilian rebellion can be allayed. Our new flagship - yes, the Lindos has finally been retired - will serve us well as the most powerful tool in the Earth Alliance arsenal.

In the meantime - congratulations! Your performance shall go down in the annals of history as something for future pilots to aspire to, and as part of the deciding factors in the EA's winning of this so very long civil war."

8124, "Alpha, Beta, take out those fighters!  All bombers retreat to the Nemesis."

8125, "What the hell are those fighters?  They look like Claymores!"

8126, "Nemesis, the Imperial has arrived to port!  The Jovians have you in a pincer!  All bombers, assist the Nemesis in destroying first the Eternity and then the Imperial."

8127, "Our fore starboard beam cannon has been destroyed!  Alpha, stop those bombers!"

8128, "A second starboard beam turret is offline.  Alpha we will not be able to continue the engagement if we keep losing turrets! We'll have to overcharge our remaining cannons!"

8129, "We've lost a third beam cannon.  Alpha, get on those bombers! "

8130, "We've lost all our starboard beam turrets. Command we need to withdraw the Nemesis!  This mission is a failure, All craft depart!"

8131, "Damage the Eternity with one salvo of bombs before moving on to the Imperial.  Our main beam turret can take care of a damaged destroyer easily enough."

8132, "Those new bombers that were orbiting the Majesty have jumped in to starboard!  They are attacking our beam cannons.  Alpha, take them out now!"

8133, "The Imperial is finished!  Now take down the Eternity!"

8134, "Eternity going down, Command. Two down, one to go."

8135, "You thought we'd miss out on the end of the Jovians, did you?  All batteries open fire!"

8136, "That takes care of those bombers.  Our starboard battery is safe!"

8137, "Understood, Command. All remaining bombers rearm.  All fighters be prepared to destroy HVel launchers and beam cannons on those vessels."

8138, "They will likely advance on you when they've sorted out their formation.  Be prepared in case some are desperate enough to attempt to ram you."

8139, "Alpha, set yourselves up for - What?"

8140, "And that is the end of that!"

8141, "Lindos, you were ordered to remain on station at Io."

8142, "There was no threat there whatsoever.  Resolute remains on station at Io in case the locals get restive.  I and my crew were not going to miss out on this for anything!"

8160, "'The irony is, of course, immense, and in some academic circles, 'a Jovian folly' means more than the mere sum of its component parts. "

8161, "Pirates, supplied and egged on by their Jovian benefactors to pester and possibly even harm the Earth Alliance, managed to destroy perhaps one of the best loved ships in the EA armada. In return, the EA promptly destroyed the pirates, and then, their rebel masters."

8162, "'While one must always remember that, certainly by this time, the EAI commissars held the deciding vote in going to war, popular opinion was most definitely in backing of seeking vengeance for the Tereus - against the pirates or against the rebels."

8163, "The populace was not dragged into any war, not this time - possibly the reverse, as EAI commissars bowed to public opinion and sanctioned the deployment of the Lindos to Pluto."

8164, "'It was only after the destruction of the main pirate base (and the end of organised pirate resistance) that the Jovians were discovered as manipulators of the ragtag Asteroid Belt fleet."

8165, "An unsupported attack on the Maginot line by the Empress, not to mention a Jovian High Command eager to take the advantage of initiative, failed and created an opening for the EA."

8166, "'Although many target the final battle around Jupiter as the deciding moment of the 2372 war, this historian feels that the true moment of victory came when the EA managed to parry the rebel attack and set in motion their own plans -"

8167, "a series of offensives from the rear of the rebel front while the EA fleet kept the rebels occupied. Had the EA lost their momentum, or had the Jovians never lost theirs, then the outcome of the war could have been very different."

8168, "'The EA, through their temporary flagship, Lindos, secured Neptune, Uranus and Saturn, destroying two Majesty destroyers - the Tempest and the Constant - in the process."

8169, "The rebels were caught unawares, and the Lindos caused a lot of damage - namely the UNU - before the rebels caught on, by which time reinforcements for the Lindos had arrived and Saturn was under siege."

8170, "'Eventually, the Jovians were cornered - all other planets were under EA control, and a fleet of warships surrounded their home. A desperate attempt by the once again unsupported Empress to destroy the headquarters of EA High Command failed."

8171, "Their only choice was to stand and fight. While the more romantic of us might express feelings of admiration for the 'gutsy' rebels, one believes that the decision was born less out of idealism and more out of an inability to do anything else."

8172, "'The final attack came in the form of a multi-pronged attack. Pairs of EA destroyers each led attacks on various rebel positions within the system of Jupiter's moons."

8173, "The only exception was the assault on the Jovian headquarters and the three surviving rebel capital ships - Eternity, Imperial and Majesty - which was led by Nemesis."

8174, "'Curiously, while the Tereus was popular with the people for its longevity and familiarity and despised by High Command for extremely high repair costs and constant retrofits,"

8175, "a new and untested Nemesis was the prize of the EA but distrusted by the populace. Regardless, it was the Nemesis, with its heavy armour and powerful weaponry, that struck the deathblow against the rebels."

8176, "'With the end to any further possible hostilities - save the re-opening of the Delta Serpentis jump node - one might expect an end to the various security measures limiting the freedoms of the population. "

8177, "However, this was not to be. In hindsight, truth, the end of conflict in the Sol system did not bring about an era of eternal peace and enlightenment... but the general unwillingness of High Command to relinquish power is somewhat worrying."

8178, "'Furthermore, the end of the war saw further mobilisation, not demobilisation. More warships were built, more fightercraft constructed... the creation of the EAI Timoros, despite the absence of any foreign hostile power,"

8179, "should be indication enough of the Earth Alliance's desire to strengthen military, and thus its own, power against giving power back to the people.'  Excerpt from TP Andersen's 'The Sol System 2335-2372'"

You are a pilot for the Earth Alliance in the 'Belt, but perhaps you are destined for greater things..."

8187, "The end is nigh. Both the Earth Alliance and the rebel powers have been engaged in an alternating secret war of technology and subterfuge for over thirty years. But now, the silence is no longer a respite from the horrors of war. Both sides itch to rid themselves of the other, and both sides marshal their forces for when the bubble of peace finally pops. And it is into this charged environment that you, pilot for the EA, have been thrown and in which you must survive."
