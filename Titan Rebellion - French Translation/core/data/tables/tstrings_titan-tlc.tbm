5482, "Following the success of the Myrmidon, RNI Systems immediately began work on another ship design, this time a far heavier ship. The result was the Azaes heavy assault fighter. Designed to maximise its blend of Terran and Vasudan technology, the Azaes is an assault bomber, with good shielding, thick armour and a large missile capacity, however, typical of Terran/Vasudan hybrids, the ship still maintains moderately good speed and manouverability. The main feature of the Azaes is the 'Maul' Chaingun mounted along the sides of the ship. These massive guns, totalling nearly 15 metres in length, with 5m long barrels, are capable of ripping unshielded hull to pieces. Coupled with a good Missile yield and a quad-gun Primary energy weapon, the Azaes is a force to be feared by smaller capital ships."

Combining the anti-fighter capabilities and speed of the outgunned Aeolus and the armor of the Leviathan, the Hyperion is a formidable target for strike craft to engage.  In addition, it has been fitted with two advanced beam cannons, which draw their power directly from the main engines.  A step above the standard armament for a cruiser, the Hyperion packs as much forward punch as a Deimos with a much smaller crew complement.  The Hyperion is rapidly filling the ranks of the GTVA, phasing out earlier cruiser models."

The consequence of this is slightly reduced armour and speed compared to the Iceni, but the Saphah remains a powerful vessel.

Combining the anti-fighter capabilities and speed of the outgunned Aeolus and the armor of the Leviathan, the Hyperion is a formidable target for strike craft to engage.  In addition, it has been fitted with two advanced beam cannons, which draw their power directly from the main engines.  A step above the standard armament for a cruiser, the Hyperion packs as much forward punch as a Deimos with a much smaller crew complement.  The Hyperion is rapidly filling the ranks of the GTVA, phasing out earlier cruiser models. The Phalanx has been modified with the Vulcan anti-fighter system."

"

5794, "You have been offered and have accepted an invitation to join the GTAII or Galactic Terran Anti-Insurgency Intelligence, informally called NeoIntel by her members.  You have passed our rigorous psychological and physical evaluations with flying colors.  We welcome you to NeoIntel, agent."

5795, "NeoIntel was formed shortly after the Hades Rebellion perpetrated by the elite members of the old GTI, or Galactic Terran Intelligence.  We were formed by the Galactic Terran Security Council and have been in operation ever since.  Our primary mission is to seek out and eliminate political or military insurrections, preferably while in their infancy.  It was a NeoIntel operative that first alerted the GTVA to the NTF threat and it was NeoIntel pilots who eliminated the last vestiges of the Hammer of Light.  With NeoIntel, you join a long and proud legacy."

5796, "We operate in complete and total secrecy here at NeoIntel.  The GTVA, the GTVI, and the Vasudan Imperium have no knowledge of our existence.  We answer only to the Galactic Terran Security Council.  This secrecy is of the utmost importance.  One of the primary duties of NeoIntel is the monitoring of the use and possible abuse of GTVI power.  As the Hades Rebellion showed, the concentrated power of the GTI and current GTVI can be a powerful corrupting force."

5797, "During your missions, agent, you may be asked to carry out unusual and even unethical objectives.  Understand that everything we do is for the greater good of the Human race.  Act on orders in mission without question.  Answers will always be given to you once the mission has concluded or there is a lull in the action.  To fly for NeoIntel, you must act quickly and decisively.  Seconds count in this business."

5798, "To facilitate the secrecy of NeoIntel, we will many times fly Vasudan or even captured Shivan fighters in order to hide our identity.  Our effectiveness as an organization depends on the complete lack of knowledge concerning our existence."

5799, "You have been assigned to the NeoIntel command destroyer Achilles.  As you may know, the Achilles disappeared several years ago inexplicably.  Many of the ships in our fleet are ghost ships in one sense or another.  The Achilles, along with the 5th Galactic Terran Exploration Fleet, assisted in the elimination of a recent Vasudan insurrection involving a second Hades destroyer, codenamed Dante.  As far as anyone is concerned, there was no insurrection and the Achilles is still missing in action."

5800, "Within NeoIntel, your designation is Agent 750.  I am Agent 33.  I'm sure you'd like the opportunity to settle in, but we have a pressing need for those fighter skills.  You'll be shipping out within the hour.  Report to your briefing, agent."

5801, "Alright, agents, let's get down to business.  Since there are a few new faces here, I'll try to fill you all in.  We've been observing a certain Admiral Mizraim rather closely for the past six months.  Mizraim is about as xenophobic a Vasudan as you can possibly find, publicly exposing his belief that interaction with Terrans will ultimately undermine the Vasudan society.  Unfortunately, due to his power and influence, these views have a good chance of becoming policy."

We have decided that now is the opportune time to eliminate this disruptive element before he can transform his views into Vasudan government policy, perhaps even eventually undermining BETAC."

5812, "To hide the fact that Terrans are involved in this operation, you will be flying Vasudan fighters.  A Vasudan AWACS, designated Tartarus, will provide jamming coverage for this mission.  It is our hope that a Vasudan faction opposed to Mizraim will be implicated in his death."

5813, "However, Mizraim, while distrustful of humans, is a brilliant tactician.  Given a certain degree of . . . conditioning . . . we believe we could make Mizraim a valuable asset to NeoIntel.  Therefore, this is a capture operation.  Beta will engage the fighters while Alpha disables and disarms the Anqet."

5814, "Once all opposition has been eliminated, a commando transport, designation Panzer, will be brought in to board the Anqet and apprehend Mizraim.  Once Mizraim has been captured, the commando team will set explosives and destroy the Anqet along with any evidence that Mizraim is missing."

5815, "We have timed this operation to coincide with minimal node traffic.  However, there is a possibility that some ships may emerge.  If this happens, you are authorized and required to eliminate all ships.  We must ensure that no one witnesses this operation.  Gamma wing will be standing by to provide additional assistance, should it be required."

5816, "Excellent work, Agent 750.  Your first mission with NeoIntel was a complete and total success.  Mizraim is in our custody and our psychological specialists will begin reconditioning him for our needs.  Once that is complete, I have no doubt that Mizraim will have much to contribute to NeoIntel.

You also ensured the secrecy of this operation.  Though distasteful, the elimination of all craft entering the area was necessary for the greater good of the GTVA.  The lives lost today would have paled in comparison to the lives lost in another possible civil war.  You are to be commended on your thoroughness.

However, we still have work to do.  Reports indicate that while NeoIntel's identity was protected, a group within the Vasudan military has been implicated in Mizraim's death.  A very testy situation between two Vasudan battlegroups is forming.  If it grows out of hand, we will dispatch a team to stabilize the situation.

That is all, agent.  Again, excellent work."

5817, "I personally can't stand Taurets, agent.  Give me an Erinyes or Ares any day.  Plus that smell . . . haven't Vasudans ever heard of showers?"

5818, "You botched the mission, agent.  We expected more from you, a great deal more than this.  Your wings are hereby suspended until further notice, pending a formal NeoIntel hearing into this blunder.

Dismissed, pilot."

5819, "Try to take out the antifighter beam and the engines at the same time.  If fighters become a problem, engage any that are attacking you, then continue to disable the Anqet.  Don't let the three transports get too far from the node or they'll jump.  Watch for any fighters that attack Panzer."

Mizraim's followers, serving primarily within the 4th Vasudan Battlegroup, have accused the 9th Vasudan Battlegroup of assassinating their admiral.  Apparently, the officers that comprise these two battlegroups are part of two Vasudan clans that regularly oppose one another.

Without an overriding drive to cooperate, our abduction has resulted in the feud's reawakening.  The 9th Vasudan Battlegroup decided to react to the accusations by attacking one of Mizraim's destroyers.  Two corvettes, the Thebes and the Khnemu, comprise the bulk of the attack force."

5926, "The destroyer under attack is the Heliopolis, a Typhon-class vessel that is currently undergoing beam-weapon calibration in the Delta Serpentis system.  In other words, the 9th is hitting the 4th while its down.  If left alone, the Typhon destroyer will be lost."

5927, "NeoIntel will dispatch twelve fighters to pacify the situation, under the guise of GTVA squadrons.  Alpha and Gamma will fly Erinyes and perform a sweep of the area, eliminating all Vasudan fighters and bombers.  They're easy enough to replace.  Beta will fly beam weapon suppression against the corvettes."

5928, "We will have to act quickly.  Though the fighter engagement will likely be a draw, the Typhon will not last long against the beams of two corvettes."

5929, "Agent 750, we've heard your something of a hotshot when it comes to anti-beam work.  If necessary, we will divert you from fighter/bomber suppression to anti-beam duty.  Remember that Sobeks have two main beam cannons, their forward-most weapons.  Target them by cycling or by using the V key on their cannon flares.  Your load of Trebuchets should allow you to engage the Sobeks outside of their weapons range, though we do not expect any capital ships to target your fighters."

5930, "Hopefully, this will be enough to allow cooler heads to prevail.  Without bombers or beam weapons on both sides, the engagement will end in a draw.  Remember, we don't care about fighter or bomber losses.  Corvettes and destroyers, however, are another matter.  See to it that all three capital ships survive."

5931, "Excellent work, agent.  Despite unforeseen intervention, all three capital ships survived the encounter.  GTVA forces have arrived on scene and we expect the Heliopolis will be back in general service within two months."

5932, "This is truly impressive, agent.  You performed above and beyond the call of duty."

5933, "Though we did lose the Heliopolis, there was little you could have done to save it against a beam weapon of that magnitude.  We can take consolation in the fact that two corvettes were saved and no further hostilities seem to be occurring."

5934, "Don't worry about it.  Crap like this happens."

5935, "Which brings us to that Terran attack on the Vasudans.  We do not know who or why the attack took place.  A capital ship of some kind, presumably Terran design, fired a beam weapon that registered like a Sathanas cannon.  The fighters, while Great War era Lokis, were equipped with a new stealth technology our instruments could not penetrate.

As you know, the Loki was originally designed as a GTI stealth fighter and played a prominent role in both the Hades Rebellion and the recent NTF Civil War.  While an aging design, we expect its features would be easily adaptable to more modern stealth technology.  Therefore, we suspect you were up against a technological testbed of some kind.

Our final conclusion is this: someone decided to utilize the confusion of the battle to test two new systems on live targets.  This group has access to advanced technology and precise intelligence.  The list of suspects is very short."

Dismissed, pilot."

Once that is done, finish off the fighters, then engage all successive waves, focusing on bombers.  Take out the Heliopolis's main gun when ordered to.

However, we do not know who was behind the attack.  Was it the Antietam's commanding officer, Admiral Hossel?  Or was it a subordinate?  More importantly, why did the attack take place?  We will continue to watch Zohar and the Antietam closely, acting only when we have undeniable proof of guilt.

You also assisted in gathering data on Zohar's Ganymede Cannon, the Saphah frigates, the uncharted node, and the Antietam itself.  All of this data will be poured over by NeoIntel analysts, allowing us to gain a better picture of what the GTVI and Admiral Hossel are doing at Zohar."

6088, "Those Tritons are gone.  No matter.  Continue on mission."

6089, "Very interesting, agent.  These science vessels appear to be mobile beam weapon testbeds of some kind.  It'll take some time to analyze all the data."

6090, "We found a possible source for that beam.  Now let's see about those stealth fighters.  Scan one of those Loki fighters docked on the Zohar's pad.  It doesn't matter which."

6091, "Excellent.  We have enough proof to implicate this GTI base in the attack.  However, this much more here worth seeing.  Stand by for new orders."

6096, "Good work, agent.  We'll need to work over the data some more, but it seems as if these Ganymede rings are being converted into a giant rail gun.  Those containers hold antimatter explosives."

6097, "Head for those two Saphah-class frigates.  We'll get scans of them next."

6098, "Two new ships have entered the area and are heading for the jump node.  Scan them if you get the opportunity, but they are not priorities."

6100, "Frigates scanned.  We're detecting Shivan weapon systems on those vessels . . . stand by for further orders."

6101, "Agent, I want you to do a quick flyby of the jump node.  Get in within 250 meters of the node epicenter and your on board scanners should do the rest.  We need to catalogue this node's characteristics."

6102, "Get out of the way, agent!"

6103, "Agent, that's the Antietam, one of the GTVI command destroyers.  This one is under the command of Admiral Hossel."

6104, "It is highly probable that Admiral Hossel either knew about the attack, or, worse yet, authorized it."

6105, "Excellent work, agent.  Our analysts now have a wealth of data to work with.  You are now authorized to return to the Achilles."

Unfortunately, it would seem our suspicions were correct.  The Vulcan testbed was piloted straight back to Zohar.  Crewmen from Admiral Hossel's command ship, the Antietam, then boarded the vessel and stripped it of its experimental systems.

Admiral Hossel, an officer of profound stature and professionalism, has been plotting against the GTVA.  It is a sad day indeed when such an officer AND his subordinates turn against all that we hold dear.

We now have more than enough proof to warrant a large scale operation against the Zohar installation.  Whatever Admiral Hossel's designs are, we will crush them utterly in one swift stroke.

Prepare for your next mission, agent.  It is time to return to Zohar."

6275, "Greetings agents.
During the second Shivan incursion, advanced fighters like the Erynies proved very effective against this terrible enemy. But the Erynies was also a rushed design: very expensive, difficult to maintain, and with several design flaws. Two other fighters were in competition with the Erynies at that time. However, the urgency of the situation demanded that the Erynies be put into service as it was the only craft to have completed flight testing. As the war reached its end, the GTVA decided to restart the Orpheus project. The two other prototypes, had undergone extensive refinement such that they came up to the required standards for the Orpheus Multi role Fighter Project:"

6276, "The Ezechiel is the first try at spacecraft for Senecal Hydrospace, a company specialized in submarines and surface ships. Senecal already had experience in the spaceship industry, however, as they have been the manufacturers for most subspace drives for light spaceships to date. Furthermore they have the proud heritage of being the ones who built the subspace reading device that helped track the Lucifer on the famous mission which dealt the final blow to the Shivan war machine during the Great War."

6277, "The Ezechiel is an surprising mix of old and new technology. Based on a rather conventional frame, it features a couple of intriguing systems to meet the Orpheus Project directives.
The ship is a rather stocky and heavy fighter. Survivability is improved by very thick armor and strong shields. If its secondary payload can be considered light, it still packs an awesome punch thanks to eight gun mounts located on the two side rails of the ship.
These rails also serve to meet the speed requirements of the OP. While four high impulse deuterium engines are used in cruise, the ship can reach a tremendous speed for a short period of time thanks to the two side rails.  These rails use Subspace Gliding Rail technology, or SGR, to open localized rifts between space and subspace."

6278, "We have tracked down Admiral Hossel's fleet to yet another installation situated near the unrecorded jump node in Ross 128.  However, Hossel's forces appear to be entering the node en masse.  The only ships that can reach the base in time are four Ezechiels."

Therefore, your objective will be to destroy as many of the departing craft as possible.  You won't be a match for any of Hossel's warships, so restrict your engagements to transports and freighters.  Don't let a single transport reach the node."

6284, "Though most of the known Hossel forces, including the GTF Shiloh, GTF Pharsalus, and GTCv Longret, are proceeding into the node, we have no intelligence on the location of the Antietam.  However, we expect it to arrive at the base before you do."

6287, "Once Hossel's fleet has abandoned the base, we may choose to capture what remains.  If so, we have one Elysium-class transport crewed with engineers and marines standing by.  If deployed, defend Panther and the Alcides installation until we have captured any desirable materials.  Good luck, agents.  Time to show Hossel just how horrible a mistake he's made."

6288, "I have good news and I have bad news, Agent 750.

First, we did destroy a great quantity of Admiral Hossel's war material departing the Alcides base.  Cursory analysis of the wreckage using your flight recorder indicates the convoy was carrying examples of Shivan technology and warship construction materials.  Excellent work depriving our enemy of those supplies.

We also captured the SCv Metatron, a corvette that Hossel had probably captured during the recent Shivan incursion that ended in the destruction of the Capella star.  We believe Hossel's engineers have reverse engineered many of the Metatron's systems, allowing them insight into Shivan technologies.

Our analysis of the battle indicates that those Lokis were cheaply constructed automated bombs, perhaps leftover stealth testbeds.  Also, I'm sure you noticed that the Antietam's beam weaponry was not operational during the fight.  Our analysts believe the Antietam may be hastily upgrading its beam weaponry to Shivan standards using materials from Zohar.

Now the really bad news.  Admiral Hossel has convinced GTVA Command that NeoIntel is plotting an open rebellion against the Alliance.  Command responded by dispatching the 2nd Fleet to hunt us down.

I have attempted to contact the Terran Security Council in order to explain the situation, with no success.  The government we served for so long believes we are the traitors Hossel claims us to be and . . . have abandoned us.  We are on our own.

We must act quickly, agents.  We not only must continue to hunt Hossel down, as is our duty as agents of NeoIntel, but we must avoid confrontation with the 2nd Fleet."

We have let our prey, the true rebel Admiral Hossel, slip from our grasp, and are now hunted by those we sought to defend."

6370, "The 2nd Fleet, lead by Admiral Brennin of the GTD Agamemnon, has been placed in charge of bringing us to justice.  Since we will not surrender, we can expect 2nd Fleet forces to shoot on sight.  Though it may become necessary to openly engage GTVA forces, we MUST keep their casualties to a minimum."

6371, "Meanwhile, Admiral Hossel's forces have disappeared from Alliance space.  Though we have suspected for some time that his ultimate goal is rebellion, we do not know how he plans to carry out such an act.  The forces we have engaged would not last long against the Alliance, even battered as it is from the war against the Shivans."

6372, "The only way we can survive this is by finding concrete evidence of Hossel's true goals and the means he intends to use.  To do this, we will have to follow him into uncharted space while outpacing the 2nd Fleet.  To do this, we have planned a series of operations to keep us alive long enough to achieve victory."

6373, "One: we must immediately evacuate NeoIntel Headquarters.  With internal spies feeding Hossel information, we can be sure HQ's location near a planetoid in Beta Aquilae's Kuiper Belt has been compromised."

It is critical that Headquarters be defended until Omaha can retrieve our people.  Defend Omaha, the Achilles, and NeoIntel Headquarters at all costs.  Our organization's survival depends on it."

6386, "Good work, agents.  You made the best of a horrible situation.  Because of your diligent defense of the late NeoIntel Headquarters, the Achilles, and transport Omaha, we were able to evacuate all command personnel.  I have personally transferred over to the Achilles, which will serve as our Command and Control until this crisis is resolved.

However, in the confusion of the battle, Former Vasudan Admiral Mizraim managed to escape.  It would appear that our conditioning was not completely successful, and our blunder resulted in his aid to Hossel.  I fear we will meet that creature again, and all too soon."

The Metatron, formerly in Admiral Hossel's inventory, was almost completely stripped down.  We have refitted it with Shivan weaponry and consider it stable enough to risk in combat.  Alpha wing will fly Maras while Epsilon flies captured Dragons."

With only the GTD Ajax still in a position to pursue us, our chances of survival have greatly increased.  Hopefully, we will be able to make a run for the uncharted nodes without the Ajax detecting us.

Our scouting wings have already made a cursory analysis of the systems beyond the two nodes.  Surprisingly, it would seem the nodes both lead to nebular systems.  Gaseous analysis indicates that the two nodes may lead to the same system, which is likely considering the fact that we have viewed Hossel's forces entering both nodes.

The Titan's modular design appears partly to explain how Hossel could construct so large a ship without being detected. The Titan is made up of a large number of modules connected to a massive frame.  We have traced the registration numbers of the cargo containers discovered in the nebula.  Analysis of cargo manifests associated with them indicate that Hossel had these modules constructed in a number of shipyards in the guise of components needed for new GTVI installations.  These modules were then spirited away to the nebula where they were assembled and armed with Shivan derived weaponry.   We must now deal with the problem of destroying such an incredible vessel and of warning the Alliance about the true threat.

Imagine this, agent: a juggernaut-class vessel, armed to the teeth with recreated Shivan weaponry, its hangar full of Terran and Shivan fighters.  THAT, I fear, is what we are about to face."

6646, "The Titan Rebellion has begun.  Admiral Hossel, the renegade GTVI Admiral, will soon deploy his ultimate weapon against the GTVA with the intention of crushing the Alliance and placing himself in charge of the new regime."

6647, "The Titan is quite possibly the most powerful vessel ever constructed, surpassing both the Colossus and even Sathanas-class juggernauts.  The Titan is an amazing fusion of Terran and Shivan technology, sporting numerous Sathanas-class beam weapons along with a massive array of defensive systems."

6648, "Inside the Titan's hangar are countless wings of Shivan replicas: Seraphim, Nahemas, Maras, Astaroths, and Dragons.  We can expect to encounter them all in the days ahead."

6649, "With the Alliance still in the dark about this dire threat, still hunting us in the blind belief that WE are the culprits, Hossel has a golden opportunity to strike and to strike hard.  The battle for the Alliance could very well end in a matter of days."

6650, "Therefore, we will dispatch our forces to every front, knowing full well that we will come under fire from Alliance and Renegade forces alike.  We MUST stop Hossel's attacks at every turn, or die trying.  Otherwise, the Alliance may soon be a dying memory."

6651, "NeoIntel scouts have located some of Hossel's fleet.  Positions of various ships indicates he is ready to begin attacks on Alliance targets.  We believe one of his first objectives will be the destruction of key Alliance installations, including 2nd Fleet headquarters in Delta Serpentis."

The Ganymede Cannon is capable of accelerating explosive projectiles to extreme sublight speeds, effectively giving the base no defense to the attack."

6656, "With two 2nd Fleet destroyers, the Ajax and the Messana, taking on supplies and numerous smaller vessels receiving repairs, Hossel will be able to crush almost the entire 2nd Fleet in one fell swoop.  We will not allow this to happen."

6657, "Before the attack takes place, we will sortie the Achilles and launch a half-hearted attack against 2nd Fleet Headquarters.  Since the Alliance still believes that NeoIntel forces are hostile towards them, we can expect severe retaliation.  Alpha and Beta wings will provide close-in support against any bombers launched against the Achilles."

6658, "With some luck, we will be able to draw the attention of both the Ajax and the Messana.  Using the Achilles as bait, we will jump out in the hopes that both destroyers will pursue us."

6659, "With the main warships gone, only the 2nd Fleet Headquarters and the numerous minor vessels undergoing repairs will be lost.  These are acceptable losses."

6660, "Also, be advised that an opportunity may arise to destroy the Ganymede Cannon.  If so, we will deploy the Minsk and additional craft to destroy the cannon.  Defend the Minsk if she is deployed.  Good luck, pilots.  Let's see if we can make the 2nd Fleet angry."

6661, "Excellent work, Agent 750.  The Ajax, Messana, Minsk, and Achilles all survived the battle.  Unfortunately, 2nd Fleet Headquarters was lost along with two corvettes and five cruisers.  We can take some consolation in the fact that the Ganymede Cannon was also destroyed.

The appearance of former-Admiral Mizraim on one of Hossel's frigates is disturbing.  Though we knew he was assisting Admiral Hossel with information during his tenure at NeoIntel, we did not expect Mizraim to be placed in command of one of Hossel's warships!  Fortunately, this seems to be a double-edge sword for Hossel, as Mizraim demonstrated that he has his own agenda in all of this.

Now, agents, there is no time to rest.  You will be dispatch immediately on another mission.  The fires of revolution are spreading and I fear we are the only ones who can stop it."

Control of the station shifts between Terrans and Vasudans according to each fleet's training requirement.  Presently, a Vasudan training command occupies the station."

6745, "Admiral Hossel has deployed two Hyperion cruisers refitted with the Vulcan anti-fighter system.  Though we knew Hossel had acquired the technology from the GTVI testbed, we are indeed surprised by the speed with which the technology has been implemented."

6746, "The Hypaspists and the Phalanx utilize advanced beam targeting, allowing them to strike fighters at nearly 4000 meters.  This, coupled with a heavy screen of flak cannons, makes these cruisers true terrors for fighters to attack."

6747, "Since NeoIntel is engaged in numerous battles against both Alliance and Renegade forces, we will deploy only three of our Vasudan craft to the area.  Alpha 1, your task will be to destroy both the Hypaspists and the Phalanx.  Epsilon will cover you.  Destroy turrets at long range with your Trebuchets or Maxim cannons, then close in with your torpedoes."

6748, "You will be flying the GVB Wadjet, a prototype stealth bomber.  This craft features the same weapons capacity of the GVB Sekhmet but is invisible to normal sensors.  This, hopefully, will prevent the beams from locking onto you at extreme range.  We don't know how close you can get before they lock on, so keep your distance until you've taken down enough turrets."

6749, "Once the two Vulcan-class cruisers have been destroyed, you will join in the defense of Aquilae Station."

6750, "We believe that additional forces will strike at Aquilae Station.  The Vulcan cruisers, while supremely adept at anti-fighter work, probably have had their anti-capital ship beams removed.  If an overwhelming force arrives, your objective will be to record their exit vectors so that we may track Hossel's fleet through subspace."

6751, "We anticipated the destruction of Aquilae Station.  Even though its protection was not a priority, it is troubling to lose yet another installation to Hossel's fleet.  However, even as the Alliance takes these losses, we are whittling away at Hossel's fleet.

To your credit, the Hypaspists, the Phalanx, and the Europa were all successfully destroyed.  The attack by those three ships seemed to be designed to clear away any potential threat from fighter craft, opening up Aquilae Station for the Shiloh and Antietam.

This was also the first large-scale use by Hossel of his Shivan weaponry, giving his capital ships a distinct advantage over our own in both anti-fighter and anti-ship arenas.

NeoIntel is doing all it can to stem the flow of history, but our forces have been continually hindered by the Alliance's idiocy in blaming us for the attacks.  Fortunately, the mounting evidence of Hossel's treachery and of our own assistance is easing NeoIntel-Alliance relations.  We hope to reach an accord with the GTVA soon.

However, today we witnessed firsthand what a truly awesome weapon the Titan is.  A frontal assault using capital ships is simply not feasible.  And given the impressive array of flak guns, AAA beams, and turrets the Titan has, a fighter/bomber assault is equally daunting.

Since Hossel�s movements indicate that he is planning to attack Vasudan controlled space first, we have moved the Achilles to Vasuda and are gathering with the 9th and 4th Fleet.
Additionally, any other ship stationed here in Vasuda, including the personal ship of the Emperor and the whole 1st Vasudan Fleet, will join us in this battle."

6993, "Furthermore, Emperor  Khonsu III of Vasuda himself will be present on his ship, as he sees the need to raise  the morale of his soldiers. He is going to deliver a speech momentarily, Agents. You are to attend."

6994, "Soldiers,
Many of thee hath lost brethren when the traitor Hossel had some of the best vessels of 9th and 4th Fleet destroyed, or when he slew some of our youngest pilots at Aquilae Station.

Be not dismayed though, my kin, because today thou shalt avenge those of thy bretheren, that have been slain by the enemy. Thou shalt return victorious, and in the glory of thy fortitude thou shalt be immersed.

On thy valor resteth the hopes of thy kin today$semicolon and what surer grounds can they rest upon? Oppression now attempteth to bend thee down to servility$semicolon wilt thou burst its chains and rise to the independence of true Vasudan warriors? Thy cause is one approved by Heaven."

6995, "Thou seeketh not the oppression of others$semicolon Thou fightest for thy kindred and sacred altars. It is a cause that claimeth heavenly protection. In this day�s battle the intervention of that God who can give victory will be singly manifested in thy favor. Let every heart, then, be the throne of confidence and courage. Thou knowest, that the enemy are strangers to religion and kindness$semicolon they are inflamed with the desire of violating the fairest sons of this land of beauty, and enriching themselves with the spoils of sacrilege and plunder. The barbarians have impiously fixed, for their struggle, to enslave us, upon the very day on which they rebelled.

Victory they shall not have! From such brave soldiers as thee, they can never wrest it. For thou fightest in defense of honor, liberty and religion - in defense of the sacred temples of the true Gods, and of thy sisters, wives and daughters. Such a holy cause must be the cause of the Gods, who will deliver thine enemies this day into thy hands. Onward, then, for thy nation and thy sacred altars!"

6996, "The Emperor has decided that he will not bear the risk of letting any of Hossel�s ships into Vasuda, so a quick decision has been made to intercept the enemy, while he is gathering his forces in Antares, and to try to take him out there.
The time of scheming and subtlety has ended, Agents. The battle of Antares is just about to begin.
Attend your briefing now, Agents."

6997, "Agents, listen carefully, there is no time to repeat anything.
This may very well become the most deciding battle since Capella.
Our main reason for fighting, is to take out the Titan.
The enemy has already assumed formation near the Beta Aquilae Node, so our initial plan of striking while they are still forming up did not work out."

6998, "Your job in this battle is to keep the Achilles alive, and should the need arise, the Pharaoh. Don't let yourself get distracted by the battle around you, watch out for your teammates, and get the job done.
Let me make one thing very clear, Agents: While the Achilles may be our last major vessel, in this mission, the Emperors safety comes first. If the Pharaoh needs assistance, you are to defend it rather than the Achilles."

7002, "Soldiers, we art pleased with thee!

Thou hast, on this day of Battle, justified all that we looked for from thy fearlessness. Thou hast adorned thy banners with an everlasting glory. The safety of Vasudan space, our own life, and a tremendous victory are the results of this day for all time renowned.

Those which escaped thy weapons are floating in emptiness. One of the most impressive ships ever built, accompanied by several major vessels, under the command of a war proven veteran, hast been, within less than half an hour, cut to pieces.  This enemy, so vaunted, and in fanatism superior, could not resist thee, and henceforth thou hast no rivals from which to fear. Thus, in so short time, this rebellion has been vanquished and disbanded. Peace is now upon us. And as we promised our people before leaving Vasuda, we made only that peace, that would not see the traitor Hossel dicdating its terms!

Soldiers, when the Vasudan people placed the imperial crown upon our head, we entrusted ourself to thee to keep it forever in those rays of glory which alone make it worthy in our eyes. But at that same moment, our enemies thought to destroy and dishonor it! And this crown of iron, defended with the blood of so many Vasudans, Hossel wanted to compel us, to place it upon his filthy head!

Rash and senseless endeavor, which, upon the very anniversary of the crowning of thine Emperor, thou hast dashed and confounded. Thou hast taught further generations that it is easier to defy and to threaten us, than to defeat us!

Soldiers, now that all that is necessary to assure the happiness and prosperity of thy people hast been accomplished, we shalt bring thee back to Vasuda. There, thou wilt be the object of our most tender care. Our people shall greet thy return with joy, and it shall be enough for thee to say $quote I was at the Battle of Antares,$quote that the reply shall be, $quoteHere is a brave man$quote."

Oh and did I mention that there is no longer an organization such as NeoIntel since you managed to screw up?"

7006, "Keeping your wingmates alive is the key really in this mission! You will have a very hard time defending the pharaoh alone, or taking down the Shade for that matter."

7007, "Too bad you could not take out the Shade fast enough to save the Achilles, Agent 750. There really would have been a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel. However, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? At least you can ensure peace in some way then, pilot."

7008, "My commendation for keeping the Achilles alive and kicking during the whole battle Agent 750. Thankfully you took out the Shade fast enough to save those men. There really is a place in the Galaxy for an organization such as NeoIntel in times to come, and with the Achilles intact, we have a power base from which we can rebuild. 
Furthermore, I heard you were offered a place in the Emperors personal guard? I don't think I need to tell you, how much an improvement in Terran Vasudan relations this is, do I? I wish Mizraim could see this. I bet he would vomit over it, and that alone is worth the trouble, isn't it?
