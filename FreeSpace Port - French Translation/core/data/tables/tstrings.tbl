20, "The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA.  Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for three years.  There is no more important symbol of Terran pride than a ship like the Galatea or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety.  In the course of the fourteen-year war, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat."

330, "Excellent"

331, "Light"

332, "Triton Dynamics"

333, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other GTA fighters."

334, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the GTF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed."

335, "Space Superiority"

336, "Fair"

337, "Medium"

338, "Han-Ronald Corporation"

339, "Original space superiority fighter of the GTA fleet.  Highly versatile, it often doubles as an assault fighter.  Low weapon compatibility."

340, "The Apollo is the most common GTA fighter.  It is highly versatile and can perform multiple roles, including space superiority, interception and assault."

341, "Interceptor"

342, "Good"

343, "High speed recon and bomber-intercept fighter.  Offers high weapon compatibility and payload."

344, "Using the old GTF Angel scout fighter as a template, the GTA created the Valkyrie interceptor fighter.  It has two additional engines, as well as an additional set of primary hardpoints.  This makes the Valkyrie the best bomber interceptor in the fleet.  Its speed is unmatched in the GTA, and its maneuverability is above average.  Its only drawbacks are a small secondary payload and a weak hull."

345, "Heavy Assault"

346, "Average"

347, "Low max velocity offset by its tremendous offensive capabilities.  High weapon capacity."

348, "The Hercules is the slowest and most unmanageable fighter in the fleet.  This is offset, however, by its overpowering weaponry and shielding.  It carries six primary weapons, as well as two full secondary banks.  This heavy assault fighter is best suited for small target attacks and bomber escort."

349, "Recon"

350, "High"

351, "Low"

352, "High max velocity offset by its tiny payload.  High weapon compatibility."

353, "Designed by GTI engineers, the Loki is undoubtedly the best reconnaissance craft in Terran or Vasudan service.  Its hull shape and shielded reactor chamber lends itself to providing a low sensor profile, yet it is capable of very high speed maneuvers.  Its relatively light armament and low armor rating make it unsuitable for extended firefights, however."

354, "Low offensive capability.  Best used in swarm situations."

355, "The old Angel scout fighter is second only to the Apollo in length of service and number of kills.  Developed as an interceptor/reconnaissance fighter in the first years of the Terran-Vasudan War, it also made a formidable match for the PVF Anubis and other early Vasudan fighters.  Upgrades to the Apollo have made the Angel largely obsolete, and the original design has since been retired in favor of its successor, the GTF Valkyrie."

356, "Light Bomber"

357, "Dynamic Metamer"

358, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Good speed for its size, with a high capacity afterburner reserve."

359, "The smallest bomber in the fleet, the Athena has oftentimes been mistaken for a fighter.  However, one should not be fooled by its small size.  The Athena can carry light bombs and most missiles.  It also has the ability to dogfight well.  Its strong shielding and hull make it the favored ''Lightning Bomber'' of the GTA."

360, "Strike Bomber"

361, "Poor"

362, "Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Can carry Tsunamis.  Good afterburner supply."

363, "Another product of GTI R&D, the Zeus strike bomber is a worthy successor to the Athena.  Its balanced design and increased reactor capacity give it remarkable speed for a bomber, yet it still remains capable of carrying the powerful Tsunami bombs.  These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against capital ships."

364, "Heavy Bomber"

365, "Heavy"

366, "Suitable for any size target.  Carries most missile types, but few cannons.  Armed with defensive turret, but still requires escort."

367, "The Medusa is the standard attack bomber in the GTA.  Its strong shielding and large secondary capacity make it the favored attack craft against cruiser class targets.  As the first bomber to carry the Tsunami bomb, the Medusa is considered the staple of any bomber pilot's career."

368, "Assault Bomber"

369, "Very Poor"

370, "Designed to annihilate capital ships and cruisers.  Slow, but offers unparalleled assault bombing capability."

371, "The Ursa is the first bomber designed specifically for the purpose of annihilating capital ships.  It carries a massive payload and is the only bomber in the GTA which can equip the Harbinger bomb.  Strong shielding and hull make the Ursa very difficult to destroy."

372, "The Amazon is a simple drone, used for basic combat training.  They are unmanned, and carry only the weakest of weaponry."

373, "The Advanced Amazon is a larger drone, used by the GTA for subsystem and large target training.  They are unmanned and inexpensive."

374, "The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible.  It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

375, "Since the start of space colonization, this standard transport has been used by everyone, both civilian and military.  While it has undergone minor changes time and again, it remains a simple design: a vehicle meant to transport personnel from one place to another."

376, "Tactical Transport"

377, "Very Heavy"

378, "Kallisti Corporation"

379, "Designed for tactical delivery of troops to enemy positions.  Low maneuverability offset by high armor rating and max velocity."

380, "The GTT Hunter was designed by GTI for surgical strike purposes requiring small squads of highly-trained marines.  Faster, smaller, and more heavily armed than the Elysium, it is capable of performing limited offensive roles in addition to carrying soldiers and cargo.  The GTI primarily uses these ships to deposit small teams of special forces units to soften up the enemy in preparation for larger assaults by conventional boarding parties."

381, "The Poseidon is the standard military freighter in the GTA.  It is designed to protect its cargo from any kind of attack, and has four turrets with which to do so."

382, "The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTA for deep space cargo transport.  It has all the electronics and systems needed to preserve any cargo within it at whatever conditions are necessary.  TC 2s are cheap to manufacture and are heavily used throughout the Alliance."

383, "The TSC 2 was developed when Terran Command decided it needed a stronger and more secure cargo container for use in military operations.  It improves on the established TC 2 design by sacrificing a small amount of internal space for a significantly stronger hull.  Although it is still not as strong as the TAC 1, the TSC 2 is usually the GTA's container of choice for cargo with military value."

384, "The TTC 1 is another example of civilian equipment used by the GTA League of Defense.  It is primarily a tech container used for research purposes, especially zero-G development operations.  It is not very strong, however, and is often a target of enemy attacks."

385, "The Chronos is a freighter of civilian design.  As the Terran-Vasudan war dragged on, more and more of these vessels were commissioned by the GTA for use in military operations.  These vessels are slow but strong."

386, "The TAC 1 (called the TacOne by most pilots) is a heavily armored container, usually used for carrying volatile or dangerous substances.  It is also the preferred supply container for use in front-line operations."

387, "The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the T-V war wouldn't be over in a few months."

388, "After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, Command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds."

389, "The Faustus science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft.  However, in the fourteen years since the Terran-Vasudan war began, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research.  Its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships, hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle."

390, "The standard Terran Probe is an all-purpose instrument that can be used in a variety of situations.  They are found in missions ranging from unmanned exploration of new systems, to scientific observation of interesting areas of space, to surveying of patrol routes or suspected enemy positions.  In a pinch, they can be deployed as communications buoys or as couriers for important messages or scientific data.  Their great speed and small size make them useful in battle situations where the enemy will most probably give them a low target priority."

391, "The GTD Hades is a new class of Terran destroyer constructed under the authority of the GTI.  Not much is known of its design or purpose, but it appears to be an attempt to recreate the SD Lucifer.  All available data on the Hades has been highly classified by Terran Command.

The Hades should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

392, "Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia-class station was commissioned, GTA decided to reclassify it as an installation rather than a space station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia-class installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability."

393, "The GTI Polaris is the GTA's standard drydock facility.  A network of Polaris modules allows construction and maintenance of nearly any Terran ship in service.  The drydock's modular design allows inexpensive replacement of damaged sections should one of these facilities come under attack."

394, "Asteroid bases such as these are used by both civilian and military contractors to mine resources and conduct experiments."

395, "The Terran NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Terran convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

396, "The Watchdog is the standard unmanned defensive sentry turret for the GTA.  It fires two standard plasma bursts at any nearby hostile targets."

397, "The Cerberus is an advanced version of the Watchdog, with stronger weaponry and the ability to withstand more damage."

398, "The Hermes escape pod has been used since the destruction of the GTD Goliath over twelve years ago.  They are used by the crews of destroyers and installations to escape destruction.  It is always best to be prepared."

399, "Mekhu/Triton"

400, "Excellent all-around fighter.  Offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.  Smaller missile payload than other PVN fighters."

401, "Developed in a joint operation by the Vasudan and Terran governments, the PVF Ulysses is an excellent all-around fighter.  It offers superior maneuverability and a high top speed.

The PVF Ulysses is nearly identical to the GTF Ulysses, except that the Vasudan variant can accommodate Vasudan pilots in its cockpit."

402, "Light Skirmish"

403, "Mekhu Enterprises"

404, "Lowest power Vasudan craft.  Offers little in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.  Best used in swarm situations."

405, "The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

406, "Heavy Fighter"

407, "Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

408, "As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

409, "Very Good"

410, "Akheton Corporation"

411, "Extremely fast with good weapons compatibility.  Very useful in any kind of engagement."

412, "The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA.  This makes it extremely dangerous.  Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy.  This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.

As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible."

413, "Sahr Corporation"

414, "Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

415, "The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses-class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

416, "Bomber"

417, "Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However, carries good payload including space bombs.  Most commonly used in cruiser strikes."

418, "The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations.  It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor.  It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity, and is faster and more maneuverable.

The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris cruisers and a D class threat otherwise."

419, "Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

420, "The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion-class destroyers in the past two years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

421, "Hammer of Light"

422, "Vasudan-Shivan hybrid.  Fast and powerful."

423, "The PVB Sekhmet is a Hammer of Light ship that appears to be a fusion of Vasudan and Shivan technology.  The Hammer of Light claims that its design was adapted from a new class of Shivan bomber heretofore unencountered by either the GTA or the PVN.

Sporting four primary weapon hardpoints and three missile bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch.  Treat it as a class A threat to all allied capital ships."

424, "The Jackal is a simple training and reconnaissance drone used by the PVN.  As the Jackal could be mass-produced quickly and cheaply, it was not long before the Vasudans used it as a template for the PVF Anubis, a piloted variant well suited for use as a swarm fighter.

The Jackal has never been used offensively against the GTA and is classified as a non-threat."

425, "The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

426, "The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size.  Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally this class has been known to act as a repair ship or tugboat.  It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position."

427, "The Bast freighter is unarmed, and considered a non-threat.  We believe that it is mainly used by Vasudan civilians, but we have seen some in front line operations.  It has very low target value, but should be destroyed, as any kind of resupply ship is a danger to the GTA."

428, "The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

429, "With three turrets, the Ma'at is a hairy target for GTA pilots to attack.  However, it is slow enough that it can be destroyed with enough patience.  As always, supply ships for the PVN are considered to be valid targets."

430, "The VAC 4 series of cargo containers is much like its normal counterpart, except it has much more plating.  However, this container is no more dangerous than the standard version, and is nothing more than ML-16 bait without protection of some kind."

431, "The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter.  It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot.  However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a class C threat.  Treat it as one."

432, "The Aten-class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans' warships, falls short as a attack cruiser.  It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry.  With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.  Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

The Aten-class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a class B threat."

433, "The PVSC Imhotep is the standard Vasudan research vessel.  Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys.  One major difference between the two classes is that the Imhotep carries a small podbay housing four remote research pods.  These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems."

434, "This large probe is more of a fully-fledged research pod than a simple drone.  Designed to work in collaboration with an Imhotep science cruiser or as part of team of probes, it is capable of numerous roles including observation, experimentation, and scientific analysis.  It is often possible for a wing of probes to conduct minor missions independent of outside supervision, allowing Vasudan Command to reserve their Imhoteps for deployment where the personal presence of scientists is most needed."

435, "Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations.  The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology.  When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.

The Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup."

436, "The gargantuan Karnak installation is the Vasudans' answer to the GTI Arcadia.  This monstrous facility bristles with dozens of turrets and can house up to two full squadrons of fighters.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a construction and maintenance yard for the Vasudan fleets.

Because of its enormous logistical and strategic value, the Karnak is considered a class A threat."

437, "The PVI Shah is nearly identical to our GTI Polaris, despite the fact that they were designed separately.  Like the Polaris, the Shah serves as a construction and maintenance facility."

438, "The Vasudan NavBuoy is widely used in both civilian and military fields.  It stores precalculated jump coordinates and other navigational data for use by Vasudan convoys, and it is also capable of acting as a communications relay."

439, "The Ankh is the standard Vasudan sentry gun.  Its most common usage is guarding supply depots.  However, since the development of the Anubis, its usage has dropped off significantly."

440, "The Ra has been used by Vasudans since our first encounter with them.  Every Vasudan capital ship has a few of these lifeboats."

441, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity.

The GTA considers the Dragon as a class A threat."

442, "Captured Shivan fighter, modified for Terran pilots."

443, "The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity."

444, "The Basilisk seems to be a Shivan heavy attack fighter.  It is not as maneuverable as other Shivan fighters, but it packs quite a punch, and it is very resistant to our weaponry.  Most often they have been used in attacking our supply convoys and transports.

Treat the Basilisk as a class C threat."

445, "We believe that the Manticore is a Shivan interceptor.  It has a very high top speed, and its maneuverability is quite good.  However, its shield system isn't strong enough to withstand constant fighting for long, which leads us to believe the Manticore's primary purpose is to destroy enemy bombers.

The Manticore ranks as a class B threat."

446, "We originally thought the Scorpion was the Shivans' best fighter.  However, we now believe that the Scorpion is nothing more than a Shivan scout ship.  Their vast numbers and seeming unimportance to the Shivan war effort leads us to this belief.  Regardless of its purpose, the Scorpion is highly maneuverable, fast, and difficult to destroy.  It can also do damage equivalent to our space superiority fighters.

In the event that you encounter Scorpions, regard them as a class C threat."

447, "The first encounter with the SF Gorgon was made by the GTD Saratoga in the Ikeya system.  We are uncertain if this is a new Shivan design or if the Shivans have simply held this particular class of ship back for the majority of the war.  The ship's unusual design not only provides it with exceptional maneuverability, but also allows it to generate an extremely powerful shield.  So far these ships have only been sighted leading wings of lesser fighters, but there have been reports of entire wings of Gorgons in larger forces.

Little else is known about the Gorgon.  It should be considered a class B threat when acting as a wing leader, but a full wing of Gorgons is to be treated as a class A threat to all allied vessels."

448, "The Shaitan bomber is only slightly superior to our own bombers - its shielding is better, but its capacity seems to be far worse.  Perhaps the Shivans were confident that they would only need one payload to destroy a target.

We consider the Shaitan to be a class C threat."

449, "The Nephilim-class bomber is the most alien of the Shivan ships.  We are still unsure as to why the Shivans chose this odd shape for arguably their most powerful attack craft.  However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to wings of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.

The Nephilim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

450, "The new Seraphim class bomber is the Shivan's latest threat.  It is three times larger than a Nephilim, and carries a massive payload at least 150% the size of the Nephilim.  With strong hulls and an almost impenetrable shield system, the Seraphim is easily the most dangerous bomber we have yet encountered.

The Seraphim has been designated a class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a class B threat."

451, "The SB Nahema has never actually been encountered by either GTA or PVN forces, as far as we can determine.  What little intelligence we have on this bomber comes from our interrogations of HOL prisoners and is strictly classified by GTI.  We do know that the Nahema was the base from which the HOL constructed the PVB Sekhmet, their Vasudan-Shivan hybrid prototype bomber.  How the HOL managed to acquire scans of the Nahema in the first place is unknown."

452, "The Azrael is most likely a Shivan transport.  While we are not completely sure of its uses, we do know that it can house many Shivans.  It is not very heavily armored, and its weaponry is not too strong.  This makes the Azrael the most common target for capture attempts."

453, "The Mephisto freighter behaves much like one of our own, but it is far more powerful and dangerous.  Very little data is available on this ship class."

454, "We believe that the Shivans use cargo containers such as these as storage depots.  We have yet to see a Shivan land on a planet.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans plan on keeping all of their materials and resources in deep space."

455, "Almost no data is available on the Asmodeus freighter.  We are aware that it has a strong hull and four turrets.  Any further data on this ship should be immediately delivered to Terran Intelligence."

456, "What we have dubbed the SAC 2 is simply a more heavily armored form of the standard Shivan cargo container.  We believe that this is where the Shivans keep their more precious supplies.  SAC 2s are to be captured or destroyed at every opportunity."

457, "The Cain is by far the most common cruiser in the Shivan fleet.  It is also the weakest.  However, the Cain should not be underestimated.  It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.

The Cain is a class B threat."

458, "While far more rare than its counterpart, the Cain-class cruiser, the Lilith is one of the most ferocious cruisers we have had the misfortune of combating.  It has extremely strong weapon systems, as well as a very thick armor which our cannons can barely penetrate.  One for one, the Lilith can easily destroy any of our cruisers.  It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.

The Lilith should be considered a class A threat to any ships that encounter it."

459, "While the Demon-class destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada.  However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters.  It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.

The Demon is a class A threat in any allied system."

460, "The Lucifer is the greatest threat to the survival of the GTA, the PVN, and both the Terran and Vasudan species.  It wields three massive flux cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation.  The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.

Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.  If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

461, "We believe that the sole purpose of the Trident is to guard Shivan repair and supply depots.  It is not too strong, but in large numbers it can be dangerous."

; species.tbl

462, "Terrans"

463, "Terrans originated on the third planet in the Sol system, known alternately as Terra or Earth.  Terrans are relatively physically weak, but are highly intelligent and versatile.  This combination of intelligence and versatility have allowed Terrans to evolve from tribal, nomadic primates (not entirely unlike their progenitors) to a spacefaring race.

Terran civilization developed to the point of relatively stable nation-states.  With space travel, the nation-state evolved into the global-state and the Terran species furthered its growth, both in material ways and in immaterial, philosophical ways.  In time, the global-state led to the intersystem-state, which in turn led to the Galactic Terran Alliance, a galactic-state.

To date, Terrans have successfully colonized twelve worlds outside of the Sol system.  Outposts have been established on fifteen other planets and moons throughout the known galaxy.  If the past is any indicator of future trends, unified expansionism will only continue to benefit the Alliance, both politically and economically."

464, "Vasudans originate on the fourth planet of the Vasuda system, the only planet in that system that is capable of supporting life.  Their home planet, also known as Vasuda Prime, is a relatively hostile world.  Both of the twin continents of Vasuda Prime are almost entirely desert, and most of the above-ground water is, even by Vasudan standards, undrinkable.  In order to adapt to these surroundings, Vasudans developed quite rapidly.

Vasudan society is complex and filled with peril for the outsider ignorant of their culture.  Vasudans have a range of social tests and protocols, such as The Conversation.  A Terran mishandling of The Conversation is presumed to be one of the major causes of the V-T War.  The Vasudan government is parliamentary in nature, but is presided over by the Imperial family and the Ambassadors, who are quasi-royal go-betweens for the Parliament and the Imperium.

Vasudan space exploration has been driven primarily by the need to find planets capable of sustaining their species.  As resources on Vasuda Prime have diminished, the drive to colonize has intensified among Vasudans in recent decades."

465, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

505, "GTW ML-16 Laser"

506, "Standard issue
Medium Hull Damage"

507, "Argon laser weapon - uses transparent ceramic technology in order to create an optical system that is extremely durable and stable under battle conditions - provides adequate destructive damage to the hull of enemy ships by vaporizing molecular bonds at the target area and destabilizing molecular bonds across the grain of the hull material.

The GTA issues ML-16 Lasers to every fighter and bomber in service."

508, "PVW VLL-9 Laser"

509, "Neon laser weapon - uses silvered optics to create a coherent package of energy that is extremely reliable under battle conditions - energy package infuses plasma bolt which is fired at a rate of 2 rounds/second - high thermal mass vaporizes most materials upon impact - prolonged application will cause material integrity failure and hull breach.

Standard issue to Vasudan ensigns.  This cheap, mass-produced laser cannon is similar in performance to the ML-16 but is slightly more effective against insulated subsystems."

510, "GTW-41 Disruptor Cannon"

511, "Standard issue
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

512, "A gas-focused krypton laser - when the ship is in flight, the chamber of the GTW-41 rotates at a constant speed - a small amount of NO2 is injected into the container .05 ms prior to the emission of the laser light - the rotation of the NO2 in the chamber focuses the laser pulse to a state that is only very slightly (1%) diffused - after the laser pulse is emitted from the chamber into space, the chamber expels the NO2 into space (thus expelling ionized molecules and moisture) - the process repeats for each subsequent burst of laser energy - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - the Disruptor Cannon is best suited and is used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Disruptor Cannon should be utilized in all capture operations in order to minimize risk of target's destruction."

513, "GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor"

514, "Advanced Version
Tactical Weapon
Damages Subsystems"

515, "The Advanced Disruptor Cannon is much like the GTW-41 Disruptor.  However, its speed and higher subsystems damage make it much more useful in operations against faster moving targets."

516, "GVW Akheton SDG"

517, "Tactical Weapon
Subsystem Disruption"

518, "A gas-focused krypton laser - fixed position firing chamber with quartz-timed injector - dynamic magnetization of the diffused laser pulse responds to feedback from targeting sensors - enhanced gaseous acceleration technology results in higher projectile velocity - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - best suited and used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun is a Vasudan retrofit of the GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor cannon.  Alongside the Prometheus Retrofit it is being pushed into mass production as part of a new generation of standard-issue weaponry, replacing the ML-16s and Disruptor Cannons used since the war between our species ten years ago.  While optimized for next-generation warships currently in development, older fighters may be unable to keep up with its demanding power requirements."

519, "GTW-15 Avenger Cannon"

520, "Special Issue
Projectile Weapon
Low Shield Damage"

521, "A rapid-fire, computer-controlled radar and gun system - capable of firing at a rate of more than 4500 rounds per minute - used primarily for close-defense situations - uses closed-loop radar technology to locate, identify, and direct a stream of highly destructive 45mm projectiles to the target.

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.  It has also proven very effective against Vasudan fighters.  However, its substandard anti-shield capabilities make it a poor choice for dogfighting Shivans, although far better than the ML-16."

522, "GTW-32 Flail Rifle"

523, "Special Issue
Low Energy Usage
Kinetic Weapon
Moderate Shield Damage"

524, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

525, "GTW-5 Prometheus Cannon"

526, "Prototype
High Energy Usage
High Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

527, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

528, "GTW-5a Prometheus Cannon Adv."

529, "GTW-5a Prometheus Advanced"

530, "Designed as a special-issue upgrade to the standard Prometheus, the Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity.  These advances come at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption, but many pilots feel that the tradeoff yields a net benefit.  This weapon's deployment is currently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions."

531, "GTW-5r Prometheus (retrofit) Cannon"

532, "Standard Issue
High Energy Usage
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage"

533, "GTW-5r Prometheus Retrofit"

534, "The GTW-5a Prometheus R is a modified version of the original Prometheus weapon.  With the link to Earth severed, the GTVA had been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of argon (a required element in the Prometheus's power-generation module) to continue to manufacture the standard Prometheus.  GTVA engineers modified the original design to incorporate some of the advanced electromagnetic mechanisms of the Banshee.  The technology has not been perfected, however, and the Prometheus R suffers from a long recharge cycle and high energy requirements."

535, "GTW-7 Banshee"

536, "Special Issue
EM Weapon
Very High Energy Usage
Extreme Shield Damage"

537, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

538, "GTW-65 Railgun"

539, "Prototype
HiVel Weapon
Long Recharge Cycle"

540, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

541, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

542, "Prototype
Depletes shields"

543, "Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon is very effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim."

544, "GTW-43 Leech Cannon"

545, "Tactical Weapon
Drains Energy
Low Damage"

546, "The Leech Cannon depletes the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use it to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.

The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

547, "GTW UD-1 Volz"

548, "Prototype
Shivan weapon derivative
Moderate Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage"

549, "UD-1 Volz"

550, "Unstable Derivative Mark One - Xaser weapon, firing an intense, highly focused beam of x-ray emissions - modified power conversion unit interfaces directly with Shivan electronics - extremely limited availability during testing phase.

The UD-1 Volz is a weapon prototype retrofitted from Shivan armaments captured by the GTI.  R&D has modified an undisclosed number of fighters to mount the cannon, and preliminary tests have shown it to be effective against shields and hulls of all varieties."

551, "GTM MX-50"

552, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

553, "Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

554, "GTM-3 Fury Missile"

555, "Standard Issue
Maximum Compatibility"

556, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - GTA fighters can carry more Fury missiles than conventional missiles, due to their small size - used for distraction and other tactical measures - very small payload (3 Kt).

Use is recommended in close combat situations and against larger targets where tracking is a non-issue."

557, "PVM-7 Fang Missile"

558, "Standard Issue
Twin Fire
Maximum Compatibility"

559, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - low accuracy offset by high speed and immunity to electronic countermeasures - very small payload (2 Kt). 

A Vasudan missile design employing a 'twin fire' technique.  It is a good choice for close combat and freighter attacks, where tracking is a non-issue. The twin-fire design increases the payload per volley and damage potential for hit-and-run attacks.  The GTA is developing its own swarm missile based on the Fang."

560, "GTM-9 Interceptor"

561, "Standard Issue
Fast Target Lock"

562, "All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

563, "GTM-4 Hornet Swarm Missile"

564, "Special Issue
Swarm Type
Slow Target Lock"

565, "Infrared and ultraviolet tracking - designed to fire in small groups of 4 missiles per burst - light medium payload per missile (12 Kt) - semi-intelligent on-board tracking - single-pass kill probability will not exceed 60% on average - designed as an offensive version of the Fury.

As a ''swarm'' based weapon, this missile can take out an unshielded fighter without any difficulty.  Its four missile system almost guarantees one or two hits, and its speed is quite amazing.  Twice as powerful against naked hulls."

566, "GTM Phoenix V"

567, "Special Issue
Anti-Bomber Missile
Slow Target Lock"

568, "All-aspect seeking - same tracking system as the Interceptor - large payload (50 Kt), but slower than the Interceptor - one of the best fire-and-forget missiles ever developed - many fighter pilots within the GTA regard the Phoenix V as the weapon of choice against high value, heavily defended targets.

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

569, "GTM-31 Disruptor Missile"

570, "Advanced Prototype
Tactical Missile
Disrupts Subsystems"

571, "Advanced signal processing - high precision interception capability - small payload (9 Kt), combining both conventional explosives and a localized blast of energy caused by the effect of impact upon the laser-propulsion system of the missile - designed to temporarily disable subsystems on hostile targets.

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

572, "PVM-2 Havoc Missile"

573, "Special Issue
Fragmentation warhead"

574, "Havoc missiles were special issue during the 14-Year War to Vasudan aces.  It holds the title of being the first missile to use the remote detonation technique later used in the Cluster Bomb.  Chips and shards of non-explosive shrapnel surround the explosive core, stripping shields and armor from its target.  Subsystem damage is minimal due to its superficial damage.  With the development of shield technology, the Havoc is now used against unshielded cargo formations and such."

575, "GTM-1 Synaptic Bomb"

576, "Advanced Bomb
Wing Attack Cluster Explosion
Area Effect"

577, "Missile propulsion unit carrying several small intelligent ''bomblets'' - when distance to target is less than 100 m or when time to impact is less than 2 sec., bomblets direct missile to the most vulnerable part of the ship of those parts of the ship facing the missile - bomblets then separate from missile propulsion unit and form a sphere - inertia continues to carry bomblets in the direction of the target - the missile propulsion unit continues to advance toward the target - when the missile hits the target or 1.5 sec.  after the missile should have hit the target, the bomblets explode - the spherical shape of the formation of the bomblets helps to ensure a fairly even level of damage across a sensitive area on the target - the spherical shape also ensures that the target will not be able to effectively maneuver away from the blast, thus ''pinning'' the target to a specific area in space - can also act as dumbfire - medium payload per bomblet (15 Kt) - very small payload for missile (2 Kt).

Nicknamed the ''Earthshaker'' by the bomber pilots who tested this, it is a bomber's best defense against fighters.  The Synaptic Bomb can do a lot of damage to a lot of ships at one time."

578, "GTM-86 Cluster Bomb"

579, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile"

580, "A second-generation Synaptic bomb, this GTI-developed cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against entire wings of enemy ships.

Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a large field of blast field, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

581, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

582, "Standard Issue
Tactical Missile
Destroys Subsystems"

583, "Heat seeking - laser tracking similar to the Interceptor - missile is protected by a small shield system, allowing for greater success in payload delivery during busy melee situations and intense firefights - fast, but low in-flight maneuverability compared to other missiles of comparable size - low maneuverability due to the size of the missile's payload (60 Kt) and on-board shield system.

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

584, "GTM-11 EM Pulse"

585, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse weapon
Anti-bomber weapon"

586, "Upon impact, the EM Pulse temporarily disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

587, "PVM-1 Barracuda Torpedo"

588, "Standard Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Moderate Lock/Reload Time"

589, "The Barracuda torpedo has been in use by the PVN since the outbreak of the Terran-Vasudan War.  These antimatter weapons do much more damage than our Phoenix V missiles, but are smaller than normal space bombs.  The Barracuda is favored by the Vasudans for attacks against cruisers and stationary installations.  Osiris bombers commonly fire these weapons in pairs for knocking out turrets on capital ships.  The Barracuda's targeting system is prone to malfunctions, and a common field modification is to bypass the aspect lock system completely, permitting dumbfire launches."

590, "GTM-3 Tsunami Bomb"

591, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Tactical Anti-Matter Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

592, "Intelligent tracking similar to GTA targeting system - prior to launch, communicates with ship computer, gathering data about enemy target types and whereabouts - slow, low maneuverability - antimatter warhead (500 tonne mass-to-energy conversion) - due to instability of antimatter, no more than 10 may be carried on board a GTA bomber at any given time, unless pilot is granted a special permit by an appropriate governing body.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

593, "GTM-X1 Serkr Bomb"

594, "Special Issue
Anti-Cruiser Bomb
Non-Conventional Warhead
Long Lock/Reload Time"

595, "Non-conventional thermonuclear warhead - estimated explosive yield not less than 3125 Mt - massive destructive capability not suited for tactical subsystem destruction - highest damage for its size of any GTA bomb - a single bomber carrying GTM-X1 ordnance has a damage potential two-thirds greater than one carrying GTM-N1 ordnance - single stage liquid fuel rocket booster - smallest turn radius and greatest linear velocity of any GTA bomb - highly efficient design for extended weapon lifetime.

The Serkr is a high-yield warhead developed as part of a top-secret GTI experimental weapons program.  Sacrificing anti-subsystem capability for sheer hull-damaging power, the Serkr delivers a destructive payload 33 percent greater than the more common Tsunami.  Like the Tsunami, the Serkr can be loaded on the Medusa medium bomber for tactical deployment -- and with a top speed of 95 m/s, this bomb stands a good chance of eluding even the fastest interceptor fighters.  GTI pilots have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Serkr against capital ships of all types."

596, "GTM-N1 Harbinger Bomb"

597, "Prototype
Anti-Capital Ship Bomb
Tactical Fusion Warhead
Extremely Long Lock/Reload Time"

598, "Fusion bomb surrounded by 3 salted fission bombs - propulsion unit is a half-size version of a regulation GTA fighter thruster (Class II) - given the weight of the payloads, the missile is slow despite the power of the thruster - as the Harbinger is exceptionally large, GTA bombers are limited to carrying 6 of these weapons at any given time - the resultant shock wave from this weapon is potentially deadly, due to the size of the payloads (5000 Mt in total) - use near allied installations or allied ship groupings is strongly discouraged by the GTA - most effective when used in preemptive defensive strike against non-military installations.

The Harbinger is our best chance of destroying the Lucifer."

812, "Observe that your wingmen have made every effort not to destroy your target.  They will only attempt to disarm, thus making sure your target will no longer be able to attack you with any of its weapons."

813, "The next step will be to disable your target.  By giving this order to your wingmen, they will take out the engines of your target, thus disabling it from moving."

814, "You will once again bring up the messaging window by pressing the communications [$c$] key.  Next, select [2] for ''wing'', and [1] for ''Epsilon''.  Finally, press the [2] key to disable your target."

815, "As you can see, your wingmen are now taking out the engines of Freighter 01.  It won't take them long to knock out the engines of this freighter, but keep in mind that other targets can require many more hits to disable it than this freighter does."

816, "Now it's time to put that freighter out of its misery.  Order your wingmen to destroy the freighter."

817, "Well done pilot!"

818, "Press the communications [$c$] button to bring up the messaging window, followed by the [2] key to select a wing, then the [1] key to select Epsilon wing.  Finally press the [1] key to have them destroy your target."

819, "Well, how does it feel to have ordered your first kill?  Hope you enjoyed it because I want you to do it again."

820, "I want you to order Epsilon wing to destroy Freighter 02.  Have you remembered your previous instruction?  If you need to, you can look on your directives for previous instructions of this same goal."

821, "Nicely done Alpha 1.  I think you've got this down."

822, "OK pilot, now that you've had your fun I want to to order Epsilon wing to depart."

823, "All right pilot, now it's time to learn about countermeasures.  A countermeasure presents a new target for the pursuing missile to go after, thus causing the missile to avoid your ship.  As you will soon see this does not always work."

824, "For this lesson we are bringing in one of our Leviathan class cruisers.  Their gunner will be getting practice hitting a moving target, you.  Don't worry, these are just dummy missiles designed to give you a feel for live fire."

825, "In a few seconds the Neptune will begin to launch missiles at you.  Once the missiles are incoming, you will press the countermeasures [$x$] key to release your countermeasures."

826, "You should also immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum, and fly away from the pusuing missile.  In fact, you should be using your afterburners a great deal of the time."

827, "Then when the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile.  The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

828, "While you are launching your countermeasures, you will also try turning your ship about in sharp movements.  This will further help you to avoid being hit by the missile."

829, "That gives us just enough time to squeeze in one more lesson."

830, "It's time for you to reload your countermeasures.  To do this you will need to call in a support ship."

831, "In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your ship to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you.  Check your  indicator in the lower portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

832, "The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your ship with any secondary weapons and countermeasures."

833, "Finally, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to you ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem on your ship.  However, the support ship is not capable of repairing your main hull."

834, "All right pilot, now for a little more paractice with countermeasures.  The Neptune is going to fire at you again.  Take evasive actions."

835, "All right Pilot, I believe that will be enough for today.  The Neptune needs to continue its training elsewhere and you've had enough for one day.  You've done a good job, considering you're just a rookie.  Return to base."

836, "First, make sure that you still have Freighter 01 targeted."

837, "To do this, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

838, "Don't worry, the missiles being fired at you are not armed and will not harm you at all."

839, "You will use your afterburners to help maintain a high speed.  Additionally, you should try to keep the missile pointer at a 3 or 9 o'clock position."

840, "You will do this by pressing the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key for Rearm."

841, "Check your indicator in the lower central portion of the HUD which shows the ETA for the support ship."

842, "Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to fully reload you."

843, "When you have succesfully evaded a missile, an indicator will come up in the upper portion of your targeting reticle.  This will alert you to the fact that you indeed evaded the missile."

849, "In addition to the shield technology, the new Interceptor aspect seeking missiles is now available.  They are more powerful than the MX-50s, but require a lock before they may be fired.  You will learn how to properly use the Interceptor in this mission."

850, "The shield is an important addition to your ship, and the Interceptors are a formidable addition to your arsenal.  You must learn how to use them well."

868, "All right.  First we'll cover use of the aspect seeking Interceptor missiles.  Note that you are fully equipped with Interceptors."

869, "Unlike heat seeking missiles, such as the MX-50, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

870, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth this effort, as its homing ability is much stronger."

871, "Once fired, the aspect seeker will track its target anywhere in space.  Once the heat seeker loses track of its target, it is not likely to reacquire lock."

872, "Freighter 1 is now entering.  Let's see how you do with those Interceptors."

873, "Target the freighter. [Press $H$]"

874, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Diamond.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This indicates your Interceptors are locked and ready to fire."

875, "Now, fire one Interceptor at the freighter."

876, "Note how fast the Interceptor moves.  They also deliver quite a payload."

877, "Note that the Interceptor is nearly useless if fired before lock has been attained.  This is a crucial difference between the Interceptor and the MX-50."

878, "Now, target the Weapons subsystem on the freighter. [Press $S$ until targeted.]"

879, "Good.  Now, wait until you have attained lock on the Weapons subsystem."

887, "Your shield integrity gauge is located at the lower right of your HUD.  It is flashing now."

888, "Your shield is divided into four quadrants, each able to withstand a certain amount of damage."

889, "When a quadrant of your shield suffers damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

890, "Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken damage."

891, "Note how the gauge changes as your shield takes more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage will pass through to the underlying hull."

892, "Note that your shield automatically recharges over time.  I will accelerate this process to save time."

893, "Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

894, "Now your shield has recharged back to full strength.  Next we'll cover shield management."

895, "There are a number of ways you can manage your shield.  The simplest is the Equalize Quadrants function."

896, "Well done.  Note that your front section has been largely recharged.  This came at the expense of shield energy from the three other quadrants."

897, "I have damaged your front shield quadrant again.  Now use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your front quadrant.  [Press $q$]"

898, "I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero strength."

899, "Now you'll learn how to maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

901, "Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the others were drained."

902, "Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking a large ship against its turret fire."

903, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

904, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can be very useful."

905, "Well done, Pilot.  Aspect seeking missiles are an important part of your arsenal.  Use them well."

906, "And proper shield management can make all the difference in a crucial battle."

907, "This concludes your training.  Return to base."

908, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed location inside your HUD reticle."

909, "I will now call in fighter drones.  When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock.  Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

910, "Once you have acquired lock, fire an Interceptor to destroy the drone.  Note, these drones will not be using countermeasures."

911, "Well done.  Now let's try something a little more difficult.  Wings of two drones will appear at once.  Destroy them all."

912, "All right.  Now we'll move on to your shield system."

Congratulations, pilot.  You have been selected for the Special Operations branch of Galactic Terran Intelligence.  You passed GTI's rigorous medical and psychological examinations, and your record of service with Admiral Po and the GTD Intrepid has been exemplary.  You are now assigned to the GTI's Special Ops destroyer, the Krios.

The primary mission of the GTI is to provide Terran Command with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of our enemies, specifically the Shivans and the Vasudan insurgency, Hammer of Light.

As a pilot for Special Ops, your missions will involve intelligence gathering and containment.  These assignments are covert and classified.  Violation of classification protocol will result in court-martial and possible execution under the Counter-Intelligence and Espionage Act."

1314, "Sol

All efforts to restore contact with Earth have failed.  As you know, the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis collapsed shortly after allied forces tracked and destroyed the Lucifer during its subspace jump.  We believe the explosion of the Lucifer's five reactors created a subspace cataclysm that closed the node, perhaps permanently.

We have no word on what became of the Terran pilots that destroyed the Lucifer, or how much of the attack force remains stranded on the Earth side of the node.

As Terran scientists work toward reestablishing contact with Earth and GTA HQ, an interim GTA Command center has been set up in the Delta Serpentis system."

1315, "State of the Treaty

Cultural and political differences have threatened to undermine the Terran-Vasudan treaty since its inception.  After fourteen years of warfare, the relationship between the GTA and the PVN has been plagued with mutual distrust, misunderstanding, and a failure to comply with the treaty's mandate of full cooperation.  Furthermore, incidents of violence between Terran and Vasudan military personnel have compounded an already precarious situation."

1316, "Overzealous Pilots

The GTA and the PVN are conducting joint operations in the Vega system.  Though hostilities between allied forces in Vega have been confined to isolated episodes, tensions have now escalated to an all-out confrontation.  During a recent Shivan attack, Terran pilots fired upon Vasudan ships with intent to kill.  Terran Command fears that if the PVN learns of this incident, the treaty and our hopes of defeating the Shivans will soon collapse."

The secondary mission of the GTI is the research and development of cutting-edge technologies.  As a Special Ops officer, you will have access to advanced weapons and warship prototypes not yet available to GTA pilots.  These systems have undergone extensive lab and field testing and should function as designed.

The Leech Cannon drains the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use the Leech Cannon to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.  The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

During recovery of the Einstein's escape pods in Beta Aquilae, unidentified fighters attacked your wing.  The results of our inquiry are puzzling-the vessels are Loki-class fighters, GTI design and manufacture.

GTI research and development created the Loki-class fighter at a top-secret installation, location undisclosed.  The prototype of a stealth fighter project, the Loki is designed to elude detection by all known sensor arrays."

1441, "Unknown Fighters

Analysis of the Beta Aquilae attack has enabled our engineers to exploit a structural weakness in the Loki, thus rendering its stealth technology useless.  We have shared this information with our Vasudan allies, and we anticipate the Shivans will also have the expertise to uncloak the fighter.

The incident does signal an even more disturbing development, however: the emergence of a rogue element within the GTI.  We suspect an insurgent cell has appropriated the Loki for unknown purposes.  However, the secrecy surrounding the stealth project has impeded further inquiry."

1442, "The Einstein

The appearance of the Einstein in the Vega System is also troubling.

According to service logs, the Einstein was destroyed during the initial Shivan encounter at Ross 128, in which the enemy annihilated all Terran ships and installations.  The Einstein had entered the system to conduct a routine geological survey three days prior to the attack.

Obviously, the Einstein's presence in Vega during our recent operation contradicts the official record."

1443, "Ross 128

Furthermore, evidence suggests the Einstein may have been a rogue GTI ship.  A high-ranking GTI operative, Captain Ezra Tycho, commanded the science vessel.  Though its official duties were limited to low-level planetary studies, the Einstein may have been involved in covert operations and weapons research.  Analyzing the data we have gathered so far, we believe rogue elements within the GTI may have known about the existence of the Shivan threat prior to the attack on Ross 128."

1444, "Rogue Elements

Therefore, we suspect the Loki-class fighters were engaged in a GTI cover-up.  The attack on your wing in the Beta Aquilae system may have been a botched attempt to destroy evidence of the Einstein's existence.

Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon will be effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim.

Certain volatile materials breached containment during the engagement, and the resulting explosion annihilated the pirate force.  However, the blast also severely compromised the structural integrity of the installation."

1449, "Your primary objective will be to escort our transports while they recover the remaining warhead materials."

1519, "Admiral Scott

I will now take this opportunity to honor the late Admiral Scott, commander of the GTD Krios, who died in the line of duty.

Admiral Scott devoted many years of service to the GTI and dedicated himself to its mission: to provide the GTA and its allies with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of its enemies.

His superiors, to whom he had given his trust and loyalty, betrayed Admiral Scott when they abandoned that mission to pursue their corrupt ambitions and designs.  GTI is now the enemy.

Let us never forget the integrity and sacrifice of this fine officer."

1520, "New Technology: EM Pulse Missile

Without the technology and expertise of GTI's research and development branch, we will lack our enemy's cutting-edge weapon systems and ship prototypes.  However, we do have a new addition to the arsenal: the EM Pulse missile.

Upon impact, the EM Pulse disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  The weapon has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also reacquire their target's signature lock."

Initial attacks have gone off without a hitch, and the Taranis is on her last leg.  Delta and Epsilon wings have destroyed most of the Taranis's fighter escort.  It is time to finish the job.

To this end, Terran Command has sent a full wing of Athena bombers, equipped with the newly developed Stiletto bomb."

The Athena is our most maneuverable bomber.  It carries a massive payload, yet, in dogfights, is nearly as effective as a fighter."

The Stiletto bomb has now been thoroughly tested back in Sol and is now ready for use.  It can be used to destroy subsystems on any ship and should prove more effective than the Disruptor cannon.  The electronics seeking device should make it simple to use.  Just point and shoot.  

Stiletto homing capabilities are limited, so make sure you get a clean shot before you launch.  The Stiletto should be especially useful in destroying the Taranis' engines and weapons systems.

All Athena bombers will be equipped with Stilettos and will be piloted by Alpha wing."

2227, "The Cain-class cruiser Taranis has been chased from the Beta Cygni system back to the Ikeya system.  It is low on supplies, and, due to recent engagements, it is lightly guarded."

2239, "To disable the Taranis without destroying it, you must employ weapons that do very little hull damage.  Your best alternative would probably have been Stiletto bombs and Disruptor lasers.

If the Shivan wing Rama is destroying the cruiser, pursue and distract them.  Use your wingmen to help take them out."

2240, "The Taranis has escaped to the Beta Cygni system.  

Not only has the chance to capture a Shivan cruiser been lost, but the Taranis is certain to wreak havoc in other systems.

If the Shivan fighters are stopping you, have Beta and Gamma wing cover you while you make runs at the Taranis.

$b Tombaugh $b Station $b Attack

We've just received some discouraging news from Terran Command, pilots.  At 0300 today, after the captured Taranis was towed to Tombaugh installation in the Ribos system, the Shivans staged a major ambush.  There isn't a lot of confirmation from the footage yet, but it's clear that a Shivan destroyer of massive proportions jumped in and destroyed Tombaugh station, along with all its defenses.  We have designated this new class of Destroyer ''Lucifer''.

Debris from the station is still falling from orbit on Ribos IV."

2270, "$b The $b Lucifer

Terran and Vasudan fighters and cruisers engaged the Lucifer, but were wiped out quickly.  Footage suggests that the Lucifer was using a new type of shield, impervious to any of our attacks.  Needless to say, this is grim news.  If the Shivans indeed have managed to shield a vessel of that magnitude, it's merely a matter of time before they wipe out all front-line installations and march through to our home systems."

2271, "$b Diplomacy

Since all attempts at communication with the Shivans have ended in violence, it appears unlikely that a diplomatic solution will work."

2272, "$b System $b Status

At this point, the Shivans have control of Beta Cygni, Betelgeuse, Ross 128, Ikeya, and Regulus.  Most of the Vasudan forces are gathering in Vega for a counterstrike, while we are gathering our fleet in Antares for an effort to retake Ribos and Beta Cygni.  Oddly enough, the Shivans don't seem to be interested in taking control of any planets in the systems, or gathering natural resources.  Instead they seem to be focused on controlling individual jump nodes."

2273, "$b New $b Technology: $b Flail $b Cannon

Research and Development teams at Sol have recently completed development on a few new weapons.

A group of Terran scientists has returned from a previously unexplored system known as Laramis, and bring with them a new weapon called the Flail.

The Flail is quite different from our typical energy cannons.  Please consult the weapons database in the Tech Room for more details."

2274, "$b New $b Technology: $b Interceptor $b Missile

Our communications with Vasudan technicians have yielded the Interceptor missile.  By combining the Vasudan-designed engine with a Terran warhead, we were able to produce the most powerful anti-fighter weapon yet.  It's an aspect-seeking missile, and requires a few seconds to lock onto the enemy's engine signature, but its speed and accuracy make it lethal.  Use it well."

2275, "The survivors of the Tombaugh attack must be evacuated from the Ribos system immediately.  We do not have sufficient firepower to retake Ribos at this time.  Your wing's objective is to escort the Iota transports."

2276, "Other wings will be accompanying this convoy.  Alpha wing will be in charge of this operation and will have command authority."

2277, "The convoy must reach the designated checkpoint.  Escort from this point onward will be provided by allied Vasudan forces, led by the PVD Pinnacle."

2279, "All hostile forces should be eliminated."

2281, "Help the Pinnacle until it has dismissed you, then return to base.  Many lives depend on this operation.  Good luck."

2282, "Your primary objective was to escort the transports to the rendezvous with the Pinnacle.  They were destroyed and hundreds of innocent lives were lost.  Such failure cannot be tolerated in the GTA."

2283, "Always make sure that Iota wing is protected.  Attack all ships that attack your transports, and try not to get too far behind them.  If you are still having difficulty protecting them, try equipping your ship with a Flail cannon.  If you survive long enough, the Pinnacle will arrive to assist you."

2284, "Great job, Alpha 1.  You managed to save all three of the Iota transports from the Shivan attacks.  We were told by the crew of the Pinnacle to congratulate you on a job well done.  The civilians on those transports owe you their lives as well."

2285, "You safely escorted some of the refugees in Iota and for that you are to be commended.  It is unfortunate that so many had to lose their lives.  They will be mourned."

We are under general quarters because a fighter patrol detected advance ships from the Lucifer fleet approaching Vasuda Prime.

Somehow, the Shivan forces have circumvented our blockade at Antares, and now control the Deneb system.  We are en route to Deneb as we speak.  ETA is thirty-five minutes, so when you leave here, report to your wing station for immediate mission briefings.

The Lucifer itself is behind the vanguard force, so we can expect it to make an appearance at any time."

The Vasudan-Terran Ulysses project has been completed, and the Galatea has received a complement of these fighters.  It is the most maneuverable craft ever developed by the PVN or the GTA, and it should be extremely useful in this next series of sorties.  It can also be equipped with the Prometheus cannon, the most powerful cannon weapon we've ever developed.  Use them both well."

Intelligence has concocted a daring plan to enable us to learn more about the Shivans.  We are going to attempt to capture a Shivan fighter.  Suit up and report to your wing stations for briefings immediately."

2464, "The Shivans have established quite a base of operations in the Deneb system.  They have multiple supply depots scattered across the system, as well as several repair centers for their damaged fighters."

2466, "All fighters in the area around the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets.  One of our objectives in this mission is to put this repair station out of commission.  This will greatly reduce Shivan capability in the Deneb system."

2467, "All the fighters in the area near the Shakti are damaged and in need of repair.  This makes them easy targets."

2468, "One of the fighters being repaired by the Shakti is a Dragon-class fighter, designated '$h Arjuna $h 1'.  The Dragon is the Shivans' most maneuverable craft, and the most dangerous."

2469, "Intelligence has requested that we capture the Dragon for research purposes.  Since the Arjuna 1 Dragon is very low on power, it is in a weakened state, and is the best candidate for this operation.  You must disable Arjuna 1 by destroying its engine subsystem."

2470, "Once Arjuna 1 has been disabled, the $f Charon will dock with it and jump back to the Galatea.  We must capture Arjuna 1.  We cannot allow it to be destroyed.  To this end, we've equipped your craft with an advanced disruptor cannon.  Use it to take out its engines."

2471, "Since this station is so poorly defended, we are sending only Alpha and Beta to attack.  Alpha will cover Beta until the Shakti has been destroyed.  Then Alpha will attempt to disable Arjuna 1."

2472, "If Alpha fails to disable Arjuna 1, Delta wing will be available.  As Delta is currently guarding the $f Bastion, we will only send them in if it is imperative.  However, we believe you can do it without their help."

2473, "Because we are custom outfitting your ship, you will not be able to customize your loadout.  You have your orders.  Dismissed."

2475, "For your excellent piloting abilities, the GTA has decided to award you the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Congratulations."

2476, "Your failure to destroy the Shakti has crippled our chances of holding the Deneb sector.  Such critical failures cannot be tolerated."

2477, "Your best bet in destroying the Shakti is your Beta wing bombers.  If you can keep the fighters off their backs for long enough for them to get off their Tsunami bombs, the Shakti is doomed.  However, even if you lose the bombers, you can still destroy the Shakti yourself.  Try taking out its weapons systems first, and then its turrets.  If worse comes to worst, you can call in Delta to assist you."

2478, "Good work destroying the Shakti.  Delta wing was successful in capturing the Dragon-class fighter.  However, due to Delta's absence, the Bastion took quite a beating near Deneb III.  She survived, but is in need of repairs.  It is unfortunate that you needed their help to disable a single Shivan fighter."

2479, "Disabling a Dragon is no easy task, but you have been equipped with the proper tools to do it.  Arjuna 1's power supply is low, and it cannot regenerate its shields.  Concentrate first on eliminating its shielding, and then focus on trying to get off any hits you can with the Advanced Disruptor.  Patience is the key."

2480, "You were specifically ordered not to destroy Arjuna 1.  Yet it was destroyed.  Such insubordination cannot be tolerated.  While we regret having to do so, we are grounding you for the next three months."

2481, "Do not destroy Arjuna 1.  While using the Prometheus to weaken its shields is useful, make sure you are only using the Advanced Disruptor once the Dragon's shields are down.  Do not use your missiles on it either."

We have now entered the Deneb system.  After your investigation of the Lucifer at Antares, Terran Command has deduced that the Shivans will be attempting a multiple pronged attack on Vasuda Prime coming from Deneb and Antares.

The Intrepid and the Minnow will be in charge of protecting the Antares-Vasuda Prime node, while the Galatea and the Bastion will be guarding Deneb."

We expect the main force of the Shivan attack will come through Antares, led by the Lucifer.  A smaller secondary force, led by the Demon-class destroyer Eva, will come through Deneb.  The Shivans already control the Vega-Deneb Jump Node, so our defense will have to be at the Deneb-Vasuda Prime Jump Node.

Finding and destroying the Eva destroyer is our top priority."

2505, "$b The $b Captured $b Shivan $b Dragon

As you know, we captured a Shivan Dragon-class fighter in Beta Aquilae.  Our technicians have retro-fitted this alien fighter with Terran instrumentation and gotten it into working condition.

However, there are a few flaws with our redesign.  We could not get the Shivan weaponry to operate, so this fighter has been equipped with Terran weaponry.  We also could not properly operate the lateral thrusters or afterburners, so the ship's maneuverability is limited.

We also have had some difficulty with the Shivan engine systems.  In test runs, the Dragon broke down for short periods of time.  We are looking into this problem as we speak.

The capture of this Shivan fighter will bring great strides in fighter technology to the Alliance."

2506, "In this mission we will be using the captured Shivan Dragon-class fighter on a scouting mission in the Deneb system."

2507, "The Shivans seem to be bringing in a large number of vessels into the Deneb system through the Vega jump node.  We believe this is in preparation for a preliminary assault on Vasuda Prime."

2508, "Because the Shivans have tight control over the Vega-Deneb jump node, we cannot send in a Terran scout.  By flying the Shivan Dragon,  we believe you will be able to slip in undetected."

2509, "There are four Shivan fighters in the area, maintaining tight patrol.  If you come into close range with these fighters, they will certainly scan your ship, detect your presence, and open fire.  Avoid contact with any of the Arjuna fighters."

2511, "On arrival, observe their flight pattern and plan your course to avoid contact."

2512, "In the event that you are engaged by Arjuna wing, return to the Galatea immediately."

2513, "Your primary objective is to conduct a close scan of all ships that pass through the Vega-Deneb Jump Node.  This includes warships, freighters, and transports.  Try to determine the contents of any cargo containers in the area, as well."

2514, "We have reason to believe that a Shivan Demon-class destroyer, the $h Eva, will be passing through this area.  If it does, it is imperative that you scan it.  Remember that your fighter is only partially functional, and its flight systems will behave unpredictably.  Be careful.  Command out."

2515, "You failed to scan enough ships for Intelligence to analyze the Shivan forces effectively.  With the Lucifer class destroyer in the area, we are in grave danger.  Your failure to collect the needed data will have dire consequences."

2516, "Scanning the warships means getting close enough to all the cruisers and capital ships to fully scan them.  The cruisers should be easy, you can simply wait for them to come to you while you are avoiding Arjuna.  Eva leaves pretty quick, so you have to make sure you scan it as fast as possible."

2517, "You were unable to stay in the area long enough to get a clear reading on the Shivan attack force.  This failure will cost us dearly."

2518, "Make sure you wait for orders before you return to base.  Only after Terran Command is sure that all ships are accounted for will you be ready to leave.  If you are being detected by Arjuna wing, make your best effort to avoid them.  Once the warships start coming in, make quick runs to scan them and then get back out of Arjuna's range."

2519, "Pilot, you bring us terrible news.  If both the Eva and the Lucifer are here in Deneb, it will be extremely difficult to stop the Shivan attack.  Still, you did an excellent job scanning the Shivan warships.  Well done."

2520, "It is unfortunate you were unable to get readings on the Shivan freighters and transports.  It would have been useful to know what supplies the Shivans were bringing into the area."

2521, "Inspecting the freighters and transports takes a little bit of cunning.  You have to be very careful to avoid the Arjuna ships, while you scan the ships as fast as possible.  The best chance of scanning the freighters is while they are docking.  The transports you should get behind and match speed.  And always use your hotkeys to monitor Arjuna's position."

2522, "The fact that you were also able to scan the Shivan supply ships is truly outstanding.  Your courage and piloting skills are to be commended.

However, the news is bad.  The Shivans have enough supplies in those ships to sustain a lengthy assault on Vasuda Prime.  We believe their attack force will consist of at least eight full squadrons of fighters, both Genma cruisers, the Eva, and the Lucifer.  Things do not look good."

2523, "The cargo you identified contains parts for Shivan fighters.  This leads us to believe that the Shivans will set up a base in the Deneb sector, near Vasuda Prime.  This information will be invaluable in planning our counterstrike.

For your diligence in reconnaissance missions, we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

We have now lost vital ground to the Shivans in the Antares system and Sirius.  The number of systems between the Shivans and Earth are dwindling fast.  Fortunately, we were able to save the Beta Aquilae communications terminal.  Aside from that single post, we have lost communications with every outer colony."

2642, "$b Transmission $b from $b Altair

The following transmission was picked up by the Terran listening outpost in the Beta Aquilae system.

''...We are a group of Vasudan refugees seeking the assistance of any Terran ships.  We were onboard a Vasudan science outpost when it was destroyed by the Shivans.  We managed to land on this uncharted planet when our escape pod lost power.  It's uninhabited, but we uncovered the remains of an ancient civilization.  They were neither Terran nor Vasudan nor Shivan."

''I say this because it is immediately apparent that this planet was also destroyed by Shivan weapons.  This is difficult to believe, considering the age of the remains, but the evidence is conclusive.  What we ask is for rescue and an escort away from this planet.  Our scientists are not normally a superstitious group, but having one's homeworld destroyed tends to shake your beliefs.  Please send an armed rescue as soon as possible to these coordinates.''"

This mission will be facilitated by the new subspace drive we have received.  For years the GTA has tried to give a fighter the ability to do intersystem jumps.

All GTA fighters are currently being equipped with intersystem subspace drives."

We expect that a wing of Ursas will be available to you on your return trip from Altair."

You may or may not want to use the new Disruptor Missile to assist you in the next few missions.  It is the only missile in our arsenal which allows us to completely shut down a cruiser for a short amount of time.  It's definitely worth a look.  Details are in the Tech Room."

From Delta Serpentis, she will certainly  make the jump to Sol to destroy our homeworld."

From the records you retrieved in Altair, we have discovered the means to destroy the Lucifer.  As you know, our shield systems do not work in subspace.  The same holds true for the Lucifer.

If we can track the Lucifer into subspace, we believe a small strike force may be sufficient to destroy it."

We have been assigned the task of destroying the Lucifer before she reaches Sol.  The Bastion is currently en route to intercept the Lucifer at the Sirius-Delta Serpentis subspace node.

The Bastion will attempt to provide close cover, while Ursa bombers deliver a payload of Harbingers.  We believe that without the shielding system it's relied on so heavily, the Lucifer will be vulnerable.

Keep in mind that this is a time critical operation.  If we do not enter subspace soon after the Lucifer, we cannot launch our attack."

From your earlier scans of the Lucifer in the Deneb system, we have determined that it is powered by five primary reactors.  These reactors are spread out across the Lucifer.

3836, "There are 3 subspace nodes in this sector.  They lead to Vasuda, Aldebaran, and Sirius.  Civilians will be transported from Vasuda to Aldebaran."

3837, "Because of the strategic importance of this system, we expect the Shivans to try to secure it quickly.  You will ensure the safe passage of all Allied vessels in the area.  Additional orders will be sent to you as they arise."

3838, "You were also able to keep the area secured until we established a stronger foothold in the system.  Well done."

3839, "You were also unable to secure the area against future Shivan attacks.  It will be very difficult to retake this sector of space."

3840, "What we are most impressed with, however, is your protection of each and every ship.  We did not lose a single freighter or transport, and the Mecross is safe from Shivan bombers.

This is truly an amazing accomplishment, and for this we are awarding you the Meritorious Unit."

3841, "Two Shivan cruisers arriving!"

3846, "You failed to protect the Hope.  Even though we were not expecting an attack from the Shivans, you needed to protect that ship.  Due to your failure, our hold on this sector becomes even more tenuous.  We all have to perform beyond our abilities in this war, Pilot.  Dismissed!"

3847, "$h Red $h Alert!  The Beta Aquilae installation is under attack.  The Lucifer has been sighted in the area.  Protect it at all costs.  Additional orders will be given to you on site."

3848, "Protecting all the escape pods is most impressive.  The survivors thank you and hope we can avenge the destruction of the Aquilae."

3849, "By protecting the Beta Aquilae Communications Terminal we are able to keep in contact with our forces in the outer systems.  Losing the communication terminal would have been a severe blow.  Well done pilot.

For continued service to the Alliance, we are awarding you the Good Conduct Medal.  Keep it up."

3850, "We lost many escape pods in the battle as well.  Such a loss of life is difficult to bear.  Several key scientists were unable to evacuate the installation.  They, and their research, will be sorely missed."

3851, "Disobeying orders and departing during battle is inexcusable.  You are indefinitely grounded.  Dismissed."

3852, "The Shivans appear to be going after the Aquilae Communications Station.  That station is critical for communication in this sector."

3853, "Protect those escape pods!"
