2548, "Great Powers"

2549, "The Miranda Accord of 2436 was signed into effect amongst the ashes of the Great War. The war was remarkable in the excesses of the tactics and weapons used, harkening back to the unrestrained industrial warfare of centuries ago. Unrestricted nuclear orbital bombardment had left several planets ecologically devastated, including Earth. By the time of ceasefire, billions of souls had perished. Humanity would not survive another such war.

A conference attended by representatives of every sovereign star nation set into motion a solemn, binding vow - never again will such destruction visit humanity's homes among the stars.

In addition to finalising the terms of armistice, a major tenet of the treaty was drafted to prevent a repeat of this tragedy by restricting the storage and deployment of spaceborne nuclear weapons to capital ships. Further treaty restrictions to nuclear proliferation limited capital ships to the three recognised Great Powers: the Atlantean Federation, Sinarus Combine and Alban Commonwealth. If any nation violated these restrictions, an automatic declaration of war by the three Great Powers would be enacted to enforce the treaty.

The galactic balance of power to enforce this treaty has been upended by the explosive expansion of the Atlantean Federation Navy, which in numbers and tonnage is double the combined strength of the Commonwealth and Combine navies. Dissenting voices questioning the relevance of the Miranda Accord have been increasing in volume, with many political commentators suggesting the need of a new Accord to limit naval construction."

2550, "     Atlantean Federation"

2551, "'Liberty. Independence. Justice.'

The Alantean Federation is the pre-eminent military and economic power in the galaxy. Federation borders make up a vast area of territory in the Orion Arm almost 500 light years across, and encompasses dozens of multi-system subnations under the umbrella of a mutual defense pact. The Federation is by far the most heterogenous of the Terran Great Powers, which it champions as its biggest strength. However, this heterogeneity makes for an administrative nightmare, and the Federation strains under the tension of balancing member systems economic and political autonomy with the need for a centralised government to efficiently manage an increasingly hungry military budget.

The Federation is a federal republic and a representative democracy. Sovereignity is shared between the national and subnational levels of government, with subnational governments representing the various polities that make up the Federation. Military spending and procurement is traditionally under the purview of the National Fleet Department but there have been increasing calls from subnational members for more financial autonomy, including military funding.

Federation naval doctrine begins and ends with working around the difficulties of covering a vast area of space. The Federation Navy is numerous, with a focus on maximising power projection and strategic reach of its task groups. Carrier strike groups are thus highly represented in the Federation Navy, with a fleet doctrine based around utilising numerous strikecraft as the mainstay of power projection. Supporting cruisers and other escorts armed with multiple small-calibre autocannons are effective enough in ship-to-ship combat but these units are not designed to provide the primary offensive punch. As a result, the Federation makes limited use of anti-ship missiles in its direct combat units, opting instead to install them on carriers and heavy bombers.

The Atlantean Federation Navy is by far the largest of the Great Powers by numbers and tonnage, twice as large as the Sinarussian and Alban fleets combined. The Navy operates a National Service model with those undertaking compulsory military service primarily assigned to support or logistics duties. Combat elements of the fleet are made up by regular servicemen and volunteers, with occasional representatives from other navies rotating through as part of an exchange program."

2552, "     Sinarus Combine"

2553, "'One people. One future.'

The successor state of the Sol Combine is a shadow of its progenitor. Rising from the ashes of Earth's devastation, the leaders of the once-monolithic administrative and political core of Humanity collectively dusted themselves off and set about rebuilding anew. The economic fortunes of the Old World were left in ruins and significant challenges were faced by it's inheritors - densely populated systems previously dependant on Earth's infrastructure needed to be supplied, with resource-rich systems in the periphery ceded to the Federation in the aftermath of the Great War.

What the Combine did have was population - a population made up of skilled, driven workers. The ruling government mobilised entire swatches of this population into rebuilding the industrial infrastructure. Investment from resource-rich nations was encouraged and economic output strengthened in the years to come. Combine leaders had to be ruthlessly efficient and utterly dedicated - there was very little room for error. Political dissent was relentlessly pursued and quashed, and power was concentrated at the upper echelons of the single-party government. Effective propaganda dissemination by the government ensured the nation's citizens knew this was a necessary sacrifice to ensure a future for generations to come.

As the economy recovered, the Sinarus Combine star fleet benefited from an extensive modernisation program. Heavily-armed warships are designed with less specialised roles than Federation equivalents with an emphasis on flexibility of movement and independent operations. The Combine Navy emphasises a 'First Strike' battle doctrine, utilising shock jump attacks with large-calibre weapons and heavy missiles. Combine battlecruisers with their balance of mobility and firepower have developed a fearsome reputation in the galaxy after successful demonstrations of these attacks. However, the Combine fleet has not been able to keep up in tonnage with the Federation, being one third the size of it's Great Power rival's.

The Combine extensively utilises heavy anti-ship missiles in its fleet units as well as batteries of large-calibre mass drivers. Rather than concentrate fighters and other strike craft in large carriers, Combine battle squadrons are often supplemented by numerous small support carriers for defensive purposes. These support carriers are often produced in substantial numbers: the Khopesh aviation frigates are by far most widely produced warship class in the galaxy."

2554, "     Alban Commonwealth"

2555, "'For Crown and Country.'

In the political landscape of the 25th century, a monarch as the head of state of a Great Power seems almost fanciful. Despite this, the Alban Commonwealth has emerged as the standard bearer for tolerance, social justice and non-partisanship in an increasingly hostile galaxy. The Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the youthful Edward Wynson, a perspicacious and well-loved sovereign. Rumours circulate regarding House Wynson's ability to read and influence people, a trait shared by each generation of Wynson monarchs. This ability has taken on an almost mystical status from various embellishments over time, and the origin of King Edward's talent is kept a closely guarded national secret.

Fortune and foresight secured Commonwealth power. The capital system of Alba is the nexus of a densely populated hyperspace network, with extensive trading lanes established rapidly after the system was colonised. The Commonwealth's economy almost exclusively relies on trade, with Alban corporations maintaining some of the largest merchant navies in the galaxy.

During the final stages of the Great War, the Commonwealth took advantage of a unique opportunity to offer its services at mediation. In a diplomatic triumph, the Commonwealth arbitrated terms that satisfied both the Federation's territorial demands and the Combine's need to save face to its citizens. In 2436, the Alban Commonwealth chaired a conference attended by representatives from every independent star nation to draft the Miranda Accord. The prestige secured the recognition of the Commonwealth as a Great Power. Though not the military or industrial equal of the Federation or Combine, the Commonwealth still commands substantial economic and cultural power.

Commonwealth military strengths lie in research and development, personnel training and naval intelligence. His Majesty's Navy is the smallest of the three Great Powers, only half the size of the Combine's and one sixth the size of the Federation. Commonwealth foreign policy has thus been to form coalitions with allied nations to offset the numerical and mass disadvantage. Commonwealth military doctrine revolves around numerous cruiser patrols safeguarding the extensive trade lanes - the source of the nation's wealth. With the added clout of being a Great Power came increasing calls for naval funding of capital ship construction and increased power projection. However, financing the significant operating expenses of the new Regent-class dreadnoughts remains a point of contention in the Alban parliament."

2556, "Middle Powers"

2557, "The central powers of the Combine and Federation dominate the heavily populated first colonies of humankind. Out in the anti-Spinward peripheries of the Orion arm, however, smaller powers jostle amongst each other for advantage. The rising power of the Alban Commonwealth acts as a tempering force, but the newly minted Great Power lacks the monolithic influence of the two premier powers in Terran space, and the primacy of its conventional military remains fragile."

2558, "     Republique Jacobine"

2559, "The Republique Jacobine is a Terran Middle Power born out of the rapid and tumultous colonisation throughout the Cygnus Reaches, with a combination of shrewd economic management and military successes consolidating Jacobine power in the region. The Republique is an ambitious rising power convinced of it's place among the stars, willing to advance Jacobine national interests where possible. Several naval outposts based in neutral or friendly nations form the mainstay of Jacobine power projection.

Though officially a democratic parliamentary government, the Republique government tends to employ authoritarian practices as part of nation building, social engineering and promoting of civic values. Part of this is a self-described necessity against the unstable and hostile environment of the Cygnus Reaches. Other justifications include ensuring the Republique remains a strong and stable nation able to overpower rival nations and competitors. Economically the Jacobines benefit from proximity to the dense trade lanes shared by the Alban Commonwealth, though proximity to these trade lanes formed the basis for tensions and competition with the Commonwealth for decades.

Decades of tensions with the Alban Commonwealth ended with the Pour Toujours Entente, signed in 2436 shortly after the nuclear destruction of Earth. This marked the beginning of forty years of scientific, military and economic cooperation between the two nations. Recent years have seen a concerted effort by the Jacobine and Alban Parliaments to create a bloc separate to the Sinarus and Atlantean behemoths.

The La Marine is one of the most capable spacefaring navies in Terran space, operating a fleet of advanced warships. Recent territorial expansions and establishment of distant naval bases has increased the operational requirements of the Republican Navy, with a concomitant increase in shipbuilding and hull numbers. Republique military doctrine favours employing large numbers of fast, high-endurance warships able to operate far from friendly bases and infrastructure. Regular combined exercises with Commonwealth forces ensure a high degree of interoperability between the two navies. As part of a combined expeditionary force, Jacobine warships are expected to provide the bulk of escort hull numbers for the Commonwealth's dreadnought battle groups. In this role, the Jacobine Navy expects to complement, rather than compete with the Commonwealth Navy.

"

2560, "     Greater Yamatan Union"

2561, "The powerful Greater Yamatan Union ranks among the Middle Powers. The vast regions of the Cygnan Wastelands belong to those strong enough to claim them, and strongest among these is the Khan-like Kamaro, overseer and High Dragon of the Union. Militant and isolationist, the Yamatan people have embraced a mechanistic, materialistic worldview, leaving little room for luxury or frivolity.

The Yamatan Union is ruled by the overseer Shin Kamaro, whose iron hand has been credited with forging a powerful nation state in the hostile but resource-rich regions of the Cygnus Wastelands. A sprawling region of space known for intense gravitational anomalies and magnetic storms, astrogation is hazardous, often requiring the use of navigational buoys and waystations to guide spacecraft. Yamatan space lies at the very edge of colonised space in the Orion Arm, and the extent of the Union's territory is unconfirmed. Estimates place the size and extent of the Union's domain as second only to that of the Federation.

A dearth of Earth-like planets has forced swathes of the Yamatan population to adapt to hostile environments, with a substantial proportion of Yamatans living in monolithic megacities or self-sustainable space habitats. The Yamatan Union routinely applies bioprosthetic enhancement technology to its citizens, with labourers and soldiers receiving particularly drastic augmentations. The psychological unease from outsiders regarding the extent of these modifications as well as condemnation over the sometimes brutal regimentation of Yamatan citizens has placed the Union at odds with other Cygnus Region nations. The Yamatan Union is particularly hostile towards the Alban Commonwealth, who it sees as undermining expansion of the Yamatan sphere of influence.

The Greater Yamatan Navy is the primary tool for advancing national interests in a nation with ambitions towards Great Power status with a conventional space military that rivals the Alban Commonwealth. Compulsory military service is enforced for all Yamatan citizens above a certain age, who upon completing their service hold reservist status for life. Union warships are stripped down, heavily armed weapons platforms that seem primitive in comparison to warships of other Middle Powers, but the martial nature of Yamatan society combined with comprehensive military training has given the Union Navy a formidable reputation."

2562, "Non-State Actors"

2563, "Though hyperspace lanes provide natural points of interest and natural roads for expansion, the huge distances involved provide challenges for national governments to maintain the infrastructure required for effective and cohesive running of a state. 

When weaker nations are unable to provide security or maintain the loyalty of their populations, non-state armed groups such as citizen militias, criminal organisations and warlords develop as alternatives to governance by the state. These groups vary widely in capability and goals, but all contribute to the challenges faced by governing states in the 25th century."

2564, "     Malika People's Militia"

2565, "The Malika People's Militia is officially classified as a Violent Non-State Actor.

The Fringe is a vast, sparsely populated region of space at the rimward edge of the Orion Arm, notable for an abundance of mineral resources. The Sulsian Hegemony had an iron grip on the major population centres, but corrupt bureaucracy and underdeveloped infrastructure allowed various militia groups in the region to flourish. Chief among these groups was the Malika People's Militia.

The Malika People's Militia is a disparate coalition of paramilitary organisations, warbands and armed worker groups across Fringe space, mustering under the banner of mercenary-turned-corsair Andri Gadaria. The overarching creed of the Militia is the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination'. In practice, this means utilising violence to disrupt or control Sulsian resource operations, bringing 'what is rightfully ours' to the Malikan people. Despite Gadaria's stated aims to found a Malikan nation, the Malikans do not yet have a centralised government, with various groups in the Fringe still maintaining their own localised rule. Alban Naval Intelligence's impressions of Gadaria's activities suggest that he is making preparations to transition these groups to a central planetary government, despite the Malikans not yet having settled a capital world.

The Militia had an unassuming beginning as an armed rebellion on the asteroid mining hub Jotram Station in 2473. Already a precarious situation due to unsafe working conditions with minimal pay, the powder keg exploded when an engineering failure led to a loss of critical supplies and the deaths of several workers. Seeing an opportunity, Andri Gadaria diverted several captured supply ships to Jotram with the intention of winning over the worker population and create a new base of support. Gadaria's charity and charisma combined with an unyielding sense of social justice ensured his message of worker liberation propagated widely across Sulsia, making him a popular figure amongst indentured labourers.

From these humble beginnings, the Militia forces are beginning to organise into a cohesive, coordinated institution. Supplied with powerful modern weapons by a mysterious benefactor, the Militia Navy has been able to challenge the Sulsian Hegemony for control of the resource-rich Fringe. However, the majority of the Malikan navy still consists of converted mining ships and transports - low-performance and low-maintenance hulls that the Militia could find and convert at short notice."

2566, "     Children of Renewal"

2567, "The frontiers of Terran Space are a region of intense religious activity. The absence of established institutions and an overwhelmingly practical worldview in a hardscrabble existence divested traditional religious organisations of authority. Ad-hoc spirituality took hold in the region, democratising religion and legitimised individual spiritual expression. Hardship and strong community ties formed the basis of this egalitarian landscape.

In the fertile ground of the Fringe, the Children of Renewal found a people primed to receive their message. The Renewal emphasis on the individual ability of a person to effect his or her own salvation resonated greatly. The message of charity and emphasis on personal development was especially popular with wealthy investors in the Federation, which provided finance for several major projects for expansion in the Fringe. These investors helped fund the construction of the hub vessel Covenant which serves as the administrative centre of the Children of Renewal, as well as the explorer ship Pillar of Fire.

The Children of Renewal believe in salvation through charity and have several outreach programs throughout the Fringe. Flotillas of repair ships and supply transports crewed by volunteers are deployed to areas of need, all in the name of the Lord. A core belief of the Renewal is that the most important work is the most difficult, which means Renewal ships are often found in disaster zones and contested regions thought too dangerous for other organisations to operate.

The end goal of the Children of Renewal is focused around the discovery of the 'Promised Land', a mystical, mythical paradise in the vein of Eden or Elysium where humankind can live free from want or suffering. Though no different to previous renditions of the paradise myth, the Promised Land dream has been sufficiently compelling to garner significant support and resourcing. Investigations are underway as to whether this manifestation is based on a verifiable location in space."

2568, "Hyperspace"

2569, "In the late 22nd century, a revolution in space travel was accomplished. An alternative dimension of space-time, hyperspace was first postulated in wormhole theory. By tunneling between two points in 3-dimensional space, a vessel could practically achieve faster-than-light travel without the deterministic complications of actual FTL travel. The first hyperspace drives were cumbersome devices employing vast amounts of energy to fold two points in space and establish a hyperspace tunnel between them.

A second revolution came about through the detection of 'highways' connecting various points in real-space. Not only was the energy requirement far lower to 'enter' and 'exit' hyperspace at these points, travel time was significantly shorter than by the previous method of hyperspace travel. With the discovery of these hyperspace lanes, Terran colonisation of the Orion Arm accelerated at an exponential level. Whilst it is universally accepted that the presence of these lanes has been a boon to our species, the origin of these lanes remains a mystery. Are these lanes a natural byproduct of the hyperspace phenomenon, or were they artificially constructed by technology far in advance of ours?"

Hopefully today's patrol marks the first of many operations alongside the Elam Navy.

3445, "Welcome back Lieutenant Ross. You performed your mission to expectation. Unfortunately it didn't have the outcome we desired.

Federation Defense Intelligence were studying an alien relic. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Combine NavInt somehow found out about Federation experiments and used overwhelming military force to kick FDI out of Mira and steal their research data. The Combine superweapon at Morik was designed using alien technology. That ship we encountered at the artifact must have been Solaris given form.

Ideally we would have wanted to gain control of the artifact. The botched destruction attempt by the Combine instead created an artificial hyperspace junction. The alien relic is out of our reach - for now.

This is where we part ways. You're to transfer to the Athena effective immediately. Captain Fisher is aware and will make the necessary arrangements. She'll drop you off at the Akrotiri system, from there you can make your way back home. I've made the necessary amendments to your service record. You'll have a cover story to explain your absence to the relevant authorities regarding your Federation exchange tour. I'd lay low for the next few weeks just to be safe.

Lieutenant McKearney is accompanying you back home. We have no more need of her services. For now.

Everything you've learned in the past 24 hours is classified Top Secret. We're dealing with advanced nonhuman technology that is beyond anything that our species has encountered or created. No one knows what this technology is fully capable of, but it won't stay secret for long. Before word gets out, we need get as much advantage as we can.

This artifact may be the factor that escalates this conflict beyond the Federation and Combine. This goes beyond old grudges, resources and national pride. The stakes have become too high. Everyone's now fighting for survival."

3479, "I'll bet you are. So you and your spy friends can keep collecting data for that little file you've got on me."

3480, "It's not like that, and that's unfair. How can you say that after everything we've been through together?"

3481, "How can I say that, after all the things you've done behind my back! Why didn't you tell me Caitlyn?"

3482, "I told you, I couldn't blow the operation, Ross! Did you even listen to my message?"

3483, "Seriously, McKearney. How do you stand being around this guy? One mission and I'm ready to cut him loose."

3484, "Stay out of this, Abbey. You've already done enough."

3485, "Sort out your domestic issues on your own time, both of you. Tell me what you see."

3486, "I see a large structure ahead of us. It doesn't look like a natural object. No energy readings, but it's hard to get anything definitive at this distance."

3487, "That must be our target. Continue course and maintain comms discipline."

3488, "Combine fighter wing on sensors. Looks like a routine patrol."

3489, "Jamming their comms. Eliminate them. We need to maintain OpSec."

3490, "They're breaking off!"

3491, "Pursue and destroy."

3492, "All right, loose ends taken care of. You fly pretty well Lieutenant Ross. You should consider a stint at ANI."

3493, "Don't you fucking dare, Quinn."

3494, "This...thing is huge. Still not getting any power readings."

3495, "Ross, does this mean you haven't given my offer any more thought?"

3496, "Fleet is my home. I'll do just fine on my own."

3497, "That's not healthy, Ross. You need a place where you can escape from all this every now and then. You'll just end up destroying yourself."

3498, "You still want me to come back home with you?"

3499, "Well, yes. Like what we discussed before. There being no one waiting for you back at Alba."

3500, "That's for me to worry about and none of your business, McKearney."

3501, "Picking up a comms burst from the Combine fighter patrol. Operation security has been compromised."

3502, "This is definitely not human. The scale, the technology is definitely beyond the Combine or Federation."

3503, "Tactical, hit that thing with active scans. I want to know everything about it."

3504, "Powering up scanners for active burst. Stand by."

3505, "Pilots, bring yourself into proximity with the Merlin. We need to link your sensors to our own."

3506, "Commander, that sensor blast picked up several contacts in proximity."

3507, "McKearney, Ross. We've linked your sensors to the Merlin's. Move out and reconnitor the area."

3508, "Merlin, we've made contact with a Combine base. Multiple hostile units. One ship of unknown designation."

3509, "We need a scan of that unknown Combine ship. Get to it immediately, before we lose this chance!"

3510, "Scan data coming through now. This is interesting...very interesting."

3511, "Fighter launch from that Combine cruiser!"

3512, "The energy emissions on that ship don't fit any profile of Combine warship we've encountered. Unable to classify."

3513, "The unknown ship is moving out. Picking up an impeller spool."

3514, "Pilots, get clear of the Combine base. HMS Athena is insystem. Setting up a rendezvous point."

3515, "This is Captain Fisher on Athena. Our arrival is imminent, stand by."

3516, "A single light cruiser? This is all they could send?"

3517, "This is all that Gorham base could spare. We'll make do."

3518, "Captain Fisher to Merlin. Apologies for the lateness. This area was difficult to astrogate."

3519, "The rules-based international order has been shaken up. It's everyone for himself now."

3520, "So is this it, Quinn? Has His Majesty's government decided to go to war?"

3521, "We're still proceeding carefully. The Miranda Accord is in tatters and the rules don't apply any more."

3522, "Athena is at battlestations. I'm bringing my ship out to engage the Combine forces. Long live the King."

3523, "Commander Quinn, I would appreciate any fire support you could provide."

3524, "Quinn, the Athena's just one cruiser. I don't know if it's enough to win this engagement."

3525, "You underestimate us. I don't intend for Athena to lose this fight."

3526, "Disruptor missile away. All pilots, stay clear of the blast radius."

3527, "Disruptor detonation confirmed. Enemy warship systems neutralised, Athena. "

3528, "Athena, this is Merlin. Combine warships systems are powering up again. Expect full combat readiness in twenty seconds."

3529, "That Combine science ship just transmitted a wide band signal. Quinn, can you locate the receiver?"

3530, "What the hell was that?"

3531, "My God...the artifact is powering up!"

3532, "Fine. Do whatever you want Ross. I'm done with you."

3533, "We've gone into hyperspace!"

3534, "We're back in normal space. Astrogation, get us a fix on our location."

3535, "Commander, we're in the Gamma Vulpis system. Closest inhabited system is Zeichenfisch, fifty light years away."

3536, "Was that a nuclear EMP warhead?"

3537, "As I said, Lieutenant. The rules no longer apply."

3538, "Is that a black hole? Where the hell are we?"

3539, "Zeichenfisch? That's Rhenaric territory. We're five hundred light years away from Mira."

3540, "Nuclear detonations all around us!"

3541, "They've seeded the artifact with warheads! That pulse must've been a detonation signal!"

3542, "The Combine wanted to deny us the artifact by destroying it. I don't think the activation was intentional."

3543, "What happened? How did we get here?"

3544, "Data analysis complete. The artifact absorbed the power output of the detonations and generated a localised hyperspace bubble."

3545, "Ross, McKearney. Dock your fighters to the Merlin. Astrogation will plot a course to the nearest Commonwealth base. This mission is over."

3546, "TO BE CONTINUED..."

3547, "Tactical, log that destruction. Destroyer Scimitar neutralised."

3548, "Gravitational sensors are picking up a new hyperspace lane from here to Mira."

3558, "Hi Stuart.

I'm happy with your flying ability. To be honest I'm just glad you're not one of those hacks hiding their lack of flight experience to get a job. The way you disabled those mines and the freighter means you're already light years ahead. I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Ferris is happy enough with how things turned out. Sulsian military security has identified the Stargazer freighter as the Samoyed. She's been implicated in 'salvage runs' throughout Sulsian space as well as laying mines for drone sabotage. I hear her crew's keeping tight-lipped. Let's see how long they can stay quiet.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. I hope this is the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

3559, "Mission successful.

Missile warfare in space is a race between seeker and countermeasure development. Large ship-to-ship missiles carry a powerful enough seeker to overcome modern countermeasures. However small anti-fighter missiles can be easily defeated."

3560, "Hi Stuart.

I'm happy with your flying ability. To be honest I'm just glad you're not one of those hacks hiding their lack of flight experience to get a job. I've finalised the paperwork and linked your account with the Hoshikuzu. Financial transactions coming through will automatically get portioned to you as per contract.

Station master Ferris is furious that we lost that Stargazer freighter. We don't know who set the mines there nor who is responsible for the salvage operations. She's threatened to withhold our payment. I had to remind her that technically our mission was to clear the salvage field and find out what happened to her drones. She's grudgingly paid our completion fee, but I don't think she'll be offering us any more contracts at Overton.

I've asked the Overton mechanics to patch up your gunship. Your flying out there unmasked a couple of stress points that needed reinforcing. I guess I didn't work the ship hard enough during space trials.

Anyway, welcome to the unit Ross. Things can only go up from here, so let's stay positive okay? Once the crew listings are all filled and the Hoshikuzu has finished refurbishment, I'm taking us to Azar station. It's a major trade station and a good place for us to cut our teeth, start making a name for ourselves."

3561, "Mission successful.

Warship astrogation systems tend to be less protected than engine subsystems, so if the objective is to prevent a departure it may be quicker to destroy the astrogation subsystem than disabling the engines.

Sometimes the weapons available do not allow for efficient subsystem destruction. In this case destruction of the target becomes the only option."

Compass Rose arrived safely at her destination under the engine power of the Outreach. The executives at Trinity Holdings are delighted with the outcome and have thanked us for recovering the cargo. I hear the injured crew members are all doing okay.

In fact, I hear that Shafer has been fined a hefty amount and his master's license suspended. It seems the Sulsian Merchant Safety Authority wasn't impressed with the way he endangered his ship with that faulty impeller, citing several safety regulations that he breached. Nice to see a regulations agency with some teeth out here. Anywhere else, he'd have gotten away with it."

I'm not too familiar with the Malika People's Militia. All I know is they're a fringe group in conflict with the Sulsian Hegemony, and the closest thing they have to a leader is an ex-soldier called Andri Gadaria. His stated goals are the 'liberation of all indentured workers from exploitation,' and 'the right to Self-Determination' whatever that means. Up until now they've been running mostly guerilla operations, and despite the Sulsian military's shortcomings, the group have been able to be contained. I've submitted a report of our encounter to the Sulsian Navy. Their threat assessment of the local militia groups needs updating.

The Malikans were definitely behind the Korra mutiny. In fact, it's starting to look like they've been behind most of the uprisings in Sulsia.

This is a worrying escalation. Those transports were carrying troops to secure their hold on Korra, which means that they aren't just aiming to disrupt Sulsian operations. They plan to occupy assets and territory.

If I didn't know better, I'd say that Andri Gadaria is going beyond his goals of worker liberation. He's building an army.

Energence Industries has paid a bonus to the Hoshikuzu's crew for taking care of the Malikan reinforcements and keeping Navo's men safe. I'm using the extra credits to source some new equipment for the gunships. I'll get Kaur to go through the new cannons with you later."

Malikan warships are sweeping through Sulsia, there's chaos everywhere. All the trade cartels are pulling out and embassies are evacuating. Everyone's fleeing while they can.

It's too dangerous for us to stay. Once the Hoshikuzu has finished repairs, I'm taking us out of Sulsia. I haven't decided where to take us yet. I'll ask around, see if I can find some safe harbour. I'll let you know soon."

4162, "Mission successful.

The majority of the Malikan fleet still consists of converted mining ships and transports - low-performance and low-maintenance hulls that the Militia could find and convert at short notice. Despite this, the Militia Navy has been able to challenge the Sulsian Hegemony using powerful weapons supplied by a mysterious benefactor."

The Albans are safe on board Pollux Arrow. They're on their way to Vicare, and so are we. Master Badami on Hopewell reports the Nassau's tow is still secure.

I'm going to need a moment to process what just happened. My cousin...was hired to kill civilians. She destroyed the Elgin. I heard there were dozens of people on that transport who only wanted to flee the war. All dead. It's all so senseless.

I want to apologise for getting you caught up in my family drama, Ross. It was unprofessional of me to involve you in something so personal, and I put everyone under threat because of it. I'm sorry. That being said, I'm grateful for your help. You and Meiks didn't have to get involved, but you did, and I couldn't have done it without you. You two are valued members of my crew, and I don't want you to forget that.

I've put us on a course to Vicare Station. The Pollux Arrow, Hopewell and the Nassau will join us for repairs and resupply.

We'll have a few days to rest up and get our collective heads together. And I'll get a chance to try to talk to Kendra."

4332, "Lau I hope you realise that destroyer's gaining on us. She's nearly in PDC range."

4333, "Lau, you're not seriously considering abandoning these civilians?"

4334, "Of course not..and if I ever get that desperate, Ross, I want you to stop me."

4335, "Transports, continue your course. I'm breaking the Hoshikuzu off to engage the Nassau. This is the only way we'll get out of this."

4336, "You've no idea how long I've waited for this Katherine. A chance to finally prove I was better than you."

4337, "You may have ruined my family, but at least I'll get some payback by ruining you."

4342, "It's ok, Ross. This needs to be done, and I know a thing or two about how Kendra fights."

4363, "Oh my god Lau, what the hell is going on between you two?"

4364, "We're also going to need help with this destroyer. I don't suppose you know any auxiliary ships available on short notice?"

4365, "The logistics ship Hopewell is in-system on standby. I'll call her in. Her master owes me a favour."

4366, "I'll be damned Lau. You managed to pull it off."

This was supposed to be a simple escort mission in a remote location away from hostile territory. Not only did the Malikans know exactly where to find us, they went out of their way to hunt us down. To add to the disaster, the Pillar of Fire has been commandeered and we barely got away with her crew.

Reverend Lightowler's understandably distraught. I think he's more upset with the setback to the Promised Land journey than the loss of the survey ship. He's assured me that he doesn't blame us for what happened. He plans to take the surviving crew and rejoin the main Renewal congregation. We've been invited to join him.

I have no idea what technology the Malikans were using to mess up our astrogation calculations. At this point it shouldn't surprise me that a cobbled together armada of militia ships should somehow have technology that not even Great Powers have access to. Thankfully Erikson was able to isolate the source of the field. I owe her a drink at Vicare's rec room.

We're running out of luck and out of hiding places. I'm in contact with Navo and Master Badami of the Hopewell. I have a proposition to pool our resources and work together. It's getting to the stage where it's too dangerous for us to work alone."

4484, "Of course I am. Who do you think test flew your gunships?"

4485, "For what it's worth it's a nice change Lau. Now you can boss us around but out here instead."

4486, "Where are you taking us, Lau?"

4487, "One sec, plotting the course there...now. You guys follow me."

4488, "All right, time for the day's business. Meet your new test subject. This is the Marchana, an old Sulsian warship sold for scrap years ago."

4489, "Vicare Station practically gave her away. She's already been gutted for anything salvageable. She'll do nicely as a target."

4490, "Give me a second to remote start the auxiliary generator."

4491, "There we go."

4492, "Ok Ross. We're going to test out your new weapons. The Stiletto is an unguided bomb that does heavy damage against turrets and subsystems."

4493, "Get at least fifteen hundred metres from the destroyer and stay out of each other's way. I don't want any accidents from stray weapons fire."

4494, "Good. Activating the Marchana's transponder."

4495, "Ok Ross. While keeping at least fifteen hundred meters away, launch a Stiletto at the Marchana."

4496, "This is why we don't use rockets nowadays Lau. They're slow and easy to shoot down."

4497, "Bear with me a little Ross. Rockets are great if you can get them to target."

4498, "Instead of complaining about the ordnance you've got, how about I show you how to make them more effective?"

4499, "Just strip out their point defense turrets before you launch. I get it Lau."

4500, "But what if there's a lot of turrets and you're on a time limit? Take out the weapons subsystem, you neuter them all."

4501, "Go ahead and neutralise the Marchana's weapons systems. There's a support drone nearby if you want to rearm."

4502, "This is also a chance to test out your heavy cannons. They take a while to cycle but their damage makes up for it."

4503, "Ok, try launching your Stilettos now. See how they perform against the Marchana's subsystems."

4504, "Actually, tell you what. Let's all give the Marchana a good send off. Everyone's weapons free."

4505, "You okay Lau? You look like you haven't slept for days."

4506, "Yeah, just a lot happening lately. Still hung up over Kendra. She needs help, but I can't give it to her and I feel so helpless. What would you do, Ross, if it was your family?"

4507, "My family? I wouldn't know. I've never had them actively trying to kill me. That counts for something right?"

4508, "You know, it's been weeks and I know almost nothing about you Ross. What was your family like growing up?"

4509, "There's nothing to tell. My home was on a glorified tuber farm in a fringe system. Had about as much colour and warmth as the tubers."

4510, "Really Ross? You grew up in a tuber farm?"

4511, "Lau, please. I'm trying to tell you something personal here. This isn't easy for me."

4512, "As one of his very few friends, I can confirm. This is a rare moment Lau."

4513, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ross. I wasn't laughing at you, really. To be honest, I'm honoured you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Am I the only one you've told this story to?"

4514, "There was...a friend before. I never got round to it. I'm afraid I wasn't a very good friend to her."

4515, "These Stilettos have decent subsystem damage. Thanks Lau."

4516, "I think joining up with the Hopewell and Navo was the best idea Lau's ever had."

4517, "You're welcome guys. It's a crazy universe out there and we need to take care of each other."

4518, "My parents were physicians. My sister became one too. None of them had ever been off-planet in their lives. It was stifling."

4519, "Have you scheduled any more weapons practice for us?"

4520, "That's it for now. We should log this with the Sulsian garrison, in case they come up with jobs for us later."

4521, "I can register our group as qualified for anti-capship strikes. We'll be in high demand after this."

4522, "You take the lead Ross. Head over to the garrison HQ and we'll go from there."

4523, "Well maybe you should tell her too, the next time you see her. I'd also like to hear the rest of your story, when you're ready."

4524, "Uh oh. This looks like trouble."

4525, "This is Captain Oberthur on the Thanatos, Federation Second Fleet. We are on a mission to maintain security at Vicare Station. Prepare to receive our vessel."

4526, "This is Commander Lutzhorn, Sulsian garrison. This is an illegal trespass. Our government has not authorised the deployment of Atlantean ships in our space."

4527, "This is not negotiable Commander. There's too much at stake here. The Sinarus Combine must not gain a foothold in this sector."

4528, "All ships are warned to maintain distance from the Thanatos, or we will consider you to have hostile intent."

4529, "Ross, this looks bad. Get back to the Hopewell immediately. Keep away from that Atlantean warship."

4530, "Be advised our government has no wish to infringe on the sovereignty of this station. We seek only to dissuade the Sinarus government from occupying this territory."

4531, "This is an invasion of Sulsian space! Our government will hear of this Captain. You won't get away with this."

4532, "Your government will thank us later when Vicare remains under Sulsian control. The Combine will not be as accommodating when they arrive Commander Lutzhorn. "

4533, "Ross, get the hell away from that battlecruiser! I'm not going down because of this."

4534, "Ross! Get back to the Hopewell!"

4535, "Though I don't really go out that much. The high-g cocktail doesn't agree with me."

Today is giving me the worst headache, and it's nothing to do with the cocktail. My two contract pilots turn out to be Alban navy officers. I don't know what to do with this information.

What you did out there today Ross was...incredible. I don't think we could have made it without you. You proved your initiative and leadership ability when you took command of the fighter wings.

That being said, this complicates things. Not only am I your employer, while you remain a member of the Hoshi's crew I'm also your captain. I was put in command of the fighter group because the Hopewell's pilots knew who I was and were willing to follow my orders. They don't know you Ross, I had to urge them to follow your orders over private comms. This really isn't good enough. This isn't the military but hierarchy still means something in this unit. We need to come up with a better way to establish who's in command. 

Now that I know you've got military command experience Ross I'm more comfortable to give you more autonomy. I just wish you'd told me sooner, not when we're under attack by a Combine rear admiral."

4543, "Rear admirals. Speaking of which. The Combine have occupied Vicare station. The entire system is in lockdown.

And the whole thing only got a passing mention in the news. No story of Kakotchka attacking civilians, no mention of how an entire system got annexed. Just a statement from the Combine how they're there to 'stabilise the growing regional unrest'. Kakotchka should be put to court for war crimes, but like that's ever going to happen. Everyone's too caught up in the new Great War, no one cares what happens out in the fringe.

4592, "We request all vessels to comply with stop and search instructions. Any who disobey will be fired upon."

4593, "Fuck that...Lau, we can't leave these people here."

4594, "They destroyed a Federation battlecruiser in seconds Meiks! They're going to roll over us like nothing!"

4598, "And we'll die if they open fire on us! We don't stand a chance against that firepower!"

4599, "Choralist, form up! Move to bearing 45 by 355."

4600, "This is Kakotchka. I say again, all civilian ships are to stand down or be fired upon. There are fugitives aboard your transports that must be brought to justice."

4601, "Oh no..."

4602, "Negative to your order Kakotchka. This is a humanitarian convoy transporting refugees from a war zone. There are sick and wounded on board."

4603, "You have been given fair warning. We cannot be held responsible for the consequences. Power down your vessels now."

4604, "The eyes of the human race are upon you Admiral. How will you be judged when this is over?"

4606, "This is Corazon Hayburn, commissioner of the Alban Commonwealth Foreign Service. Be advised there are Alban diplomatic personnel aboard these transports."

4609, "Combine ships are closing. Lau, we need a plan!"

4610, "Fists up, Stuart lad. You're a King's Officer and you have a duty to fulfil."

4612, "God damn it Meiks. I know, I know!"

4613, "Ross? Since when were you a Commonwealth officer?"

4614, "Lau, give me command of the fighter wings. This is the only way we're coming out of this."

4615, "You want command of the fighters? Uh, sure. If you know what you're doing."

4616, "All right everyone. Looks like the Combine are sending their LACs in as a vanguard. Standard Combine battle doctrine."

4617, "Anyone carrying heavy cannons focus on the LACs. Fighters, I need you to keep the escorts busy."

4618, "Long live the King!"

4619, "Thank you Lau. We'll get through this."

4620, "That's the last LAC down!"

4621, "That's the fighters taken care of."

4622, "All right. First wave down! That'll be their strikecraft options spent."

4623, "We need to take out that battlecruiser quick. Her guns'll make short work of our ships."

4624, "Then our target is the Zaragoza's weapons subsystem. She'll lose fire control for her mass drivers."

4625, "Ross, I don't understand. Why haven't those cruisers fired another missile barrage?"

4626, "Maybe they're trying to save ammunition, or minimise collateral damage?"

4627, "Lau, Ross. Those cruisers are arsenal ships. They have ammunition for two salvoes only. They're spent and are no longer a threat to us."

4628, "What? How could you know that Erikson? No one's seen these cruisers before."

4629, "I have Lau."

4630, "We've got a lock on the Zaragoza. Kai silos are armed and ready for launch."

4631, "Lau, we're reading an impeller spool on that battlecruiser. "

4632, "I don't believe it! We've driven off the Zaragoza."

4633, "Ross, it's working! The Zaragoza is peeling off!"

4634, "Combine reinforcements have jumped in! A destroyer wolfpack led by a light cruiser."

4635, "Lau, we're losing control of the tactical situation."

4636, "Like we ever had control in the first place."

4637, "This isn't going to work. The transports still need a few minutes of spool. I'm preparing the Nassau to assault the Zaragoza."

4638, "It's going to be rough Navo. I'm bringing the Hoshikuzu alongside to support. You'll need the extra firepower."

4639, "Let's take out their PDCs so our ASMs have a clear run to that battlecruiser. Call out targets for highlight."

4640, "Nassau, Hoshikuzu. Our ships have cleared minimum safe distance. We're commencing impeller spool for hyperspace jump."

4641, "The battlecruiser is impeding our jump vector. We still need to clear that warship's vicinity."

4642, "Civilian transports are away! Good fighting Erikson."

4643, "Oh thank god. Erikson, Navo, get your ships out. All fighters, move to the Hopewell. It's time to leave."

4644, "Lau, the Hoshikuzu is taking a beating."

4645, "Erikson, be careful! Don't break my ship."

4646, "Ugh, Erikson! Be careful!"

4647, "Hey Lau. [[Who's this idiot who thinks he can give us orders?]]"

4648, "Follow his orders Enrique. [He's a friend and I trust him.]"

4649, "Ross, that battlecruiser is getting pretty close."

4650, "Erikson, we need to have a talk."

4651, "This is a bloody shambles. No fighter cover and letting the Combine get the jump on them. Amateurs!"

4652, "Stay with the convoy Ross! Let the Federation deal with the Combine ships."

4653, "Lau, this is Navo. The Nassau's taken a beating."

4654, "Kaur, warm up the ASM launcher. Let's see what this thing can do."

4655, "The Hopewell! She's going down!"

4656, "There goes Zaragoza weapons control. We've got a bit of breathing space."

4657, "Even then she can still target manually. It won't be accurate but we only need to be unlucky once. I'd take out her guns as well just to be sure."

We can confirm all Renewal convoy ships are accounted for, with no casualties reported. The Crown is grateful for your assistance, and payment has been forwarded as per contract.

Unfortunately the efforts of Navo's marines to apprehend the crew were unsuccessful. The freighter crew were clearly on a suicide mission and had contingencies in place in the event of capture. There was not enough left of their bodies for a clear identity verification. We have recovered the remains for DNA matching.

I have compiled a report to Crown High Command regarding the events of today. I plan to especially highlight the contributions of Lieutenant Stuart Ross who was crucial to the neutralisation of the nuclear attack. May he continue to serve Sulsia with the same dedication as he serves His Majesty."

4715, "Aye. Arming Malikan pirates, disrupting Sulsian trade and attacking Commonwealth civilians? That's going to be taken as a declaration of war."

4716, "So you're saying the Commonwealth doesn't have the resources to transport a few refugees? Your so-called $quoteGreat Power$quote?"

4717, "War's already here. Declaration is just a formality at this point."

4718, "Sulsian fighters, this is Commander Cameron, HMS Aria. We have a situation that needs your cooperation."

4719, "This is Katherine Lau. We'll cooperate, but are currently employed by the Children of Renewal. You'll have to run it past them."

4720, "Thank you, Katherine Lau. Reverend Frances on Covenant has nominated your wing specifically."

4721, "Then I suppose we're at your service. What's the situation?"

4722, "Our sensors detected a heat spike on one of the freighters around Covenant. It may be a tritium leak from their fusion reactor but we need to confirm this and offer assistance if required."

4723, "If the ship does have an unstable reactor, it'll pose an explosive hazard to nearby Renewal ships. We will need to isolate and repair the freighter."

4724, "Have you tried contacting the freighter's master?"

4725, "Of course. The only reply is a repeating automatic message citing a comms failure."

4726, "I'm sending you the transponder code of the freighter. We'll need an active scan of the cargo and the ship's comms subsystem to confirm her distress."

4727, "Ross, can you go? Meiks and I will stay with the Golgotha in case we're needed."

4728, "Aria, Alfa 1 off Hopewell. Cargo painted. I see the tritium leak, but it's from the cargo box, not the ship's reactor."

4729, "Aria copies, Alfa 1. Scan the comms subsystem of the freighter."

4730, "Aria, Alfa 1. I've run a remote diagnostic on that freighter. Her transceiver is in full working condition."

4732, "We've got movement! The freighter's burning towards the Golgotha!"

4733, "Commander! We've picked up antimatter catalysers inside that freighter's cargo manifest. Yields suggest planet-killer nuclear warheads."

4734, "All ships in the vicinity, this is Commander Anil Cameron of HMS Aria. Be advised we have a confirmed radiological threat. Make best speed to a distance of five klicks from the specified freighter."

4736, "Oh shit!"

4737, "Shoot that freighter down Ross! They're suicide bombers on a mission to-"

4738, "Belay that lad! That's a planet cracker! It'll have at least a five kilometre radius. If that cargo container gets hit, it could detonate the warhead."

4739, "The freighter crew is going to detonate that warhead anyway! We have to take the chance!"

4740, "This is transport Remembering Golgotha. We have two thousand souls aboard. Please help us!"

4741, "The warhead's gone active! Reading a sustained nuclear chain reaction on the freighter."

4742, "Lau, get yourself and Meiks clear of the blast radius! Make sure everyone scatters as far as they can!"

4743, "We're not leaving these refugees to die!"

4744, "Katherine Lau. The freighter is closing in on the Golgotha. You've done all you can. Get your ships clear."

4745, "I'm...sorry Reverend. I'm sorry your people weren't able to see their Promised Land."

4749, "The Lord teaches us that the most important roads are often the most difficult. This is not a failure Katherine Lau. It is a test for our people, one that we will overcome."

4750, "Transport Golgotha. Be advised we may have identified a bypass for the warhead's detonation trigger. Continue to make distance from the freighter. Alfa 1, we need further assistance."

4751, "Say again Aria? Have you found a way to deactivate the warhead?"

4752, "Your scan helped pinpoint the freighter's transmitting frequencies to the nuclear warhead. We may be able to repurpose the warhead's receiver."

4753, "We should be able to bypass the detonation trigger by tracing its link to the freighter's computer. We just need scan data of the rest of the subsystems."

4754, "That'll do it. Ensign Holmes, bypass the trigger for the warhead's arming sequence. It won't stop a contact detonation but it's a start."

4755, "Helm, maintain a tight formation to the freighter. That bypass is on a tightrope. If we lose signal integrity at any time, we won't be around long enough to regret it."

4756, "We've bought some time. Alfa 1, disable the freighter's engines. Please be mindful of your aim. A stray shot may well set off the device."

4757, "Reverend Lightowler, stand down. The freighter's dead in space and the warhead detonation trigger has been disabled. Breathe easy."

4758, "You did it Ross!"

4759, "Great work lad. Now what do we do with that freighter?"

The destruction of the patrol wings will also degrade the Qahtadnan presence in the asteroid field, allowing us to deploy scouts of our own.

We've scored a major victory today, but our work here has only begun. Admiral Akrami has deployed the destroyer Euphrates to link up with the Artemis in response to Qahtadnan strategic movements in Durius. It looks like a major Qahtadnan invasion of Durius is imminent.

If you want to secure a warship's destruction, destroy the Engine or Astrogation subsystem to prevent it from warping out. However, driving off a hostile ship is often good enough to resolve the engagement.

You can also decrease the difficulty in the ingame options menu (F2) if hitting enemy fighters is a challenge. This will not change AI behaviour or flying mechanics, but will slightly increase the amount of aim assistance given to you, and the amount of damage you can take before dying."

The freighter's electronic manifest originates from Brenner, the Combine system where she allegedly collected the mining equipment. Usually the station commander signs off the shipment before departure is authorised, but this particular convoy was signed off by Rear Admiral Kakotchka herself.  

ANI is collating the data against what we already know of Kakotchka and a case will be made at the International Court of Justice. Fleet Admiral Proctor has already authorised the deployment of a battle squadron to Sulsia to contest Kakotchka's annexation of Vicare Station. Rear Admiral Cleghorn on HMS Formidable will arrive in Sulsia in a few days.

I've signed off on the payment transfer to Katherine Lau's account. Your group did well enough out there. In particular I've made note of your competence in my report to Command. Your performance was instrumental in our success today, and I'll make sure the right people know about it.

I'm taking the Aria to Ladigue station for resupply and service before heading back to our mission at Covenant. This is where we part ways. 

However, there's one more thing. As you know the Arrowhead corvettes have field maintenance facilities for an attending fighter. I would not be averse to having a pilot like yourself as part of my crew when you decide to return to full pay. Think about it, Lieutenant."

We now know why Gadaria went to ground. He's built himself a damned capital ship, and it's armed with nuclear weapons. I don't know how the hell Bertini's going to stop him this time. This is beyond anything the Sulsians have.

The Sulsians are going to bring this to the International Court of Justice. This is a massive breach of the Miranda Accord. We all learned about it at school, it's the foundation for everything our society stands for. Gadaria has the power to bring Armageddon, and the Sinarus Combine gave him this power.

Admiral Bertini's released us from service. Jotram Station has been occupied by Sulsian troops and is now secure, but with Gadaria gone the war will continue on. The resources captured will help, but no one knows how long the Sulsians can hold the station if the Malikans try a recapture. It looks like your Commonwealth will have to step in after all."

The Miranda Accord was drafted in the aftermath of the Great War. Outrage and sorrow over the nuclear devastation of several planets, including Earth, drove the nations of humanity to vow 'Never again'.

The Accord curbs the proliferation of spaceborne nuclear weapons by restricting their use to the Great Powers of the Federation, Combine and Commonwealth. Failure to abide by the treaty would trigger a censure and forcible disarmament by all three Powers. A Great Power in breach of the treaty would also trigger action by the other two Great Powers.

How can one man hold so much power? What did he plan to do with it?

I don't know what happened to Covenant. I don't know if Kakotchka and Gadaria got to Lightowler or if he was able to make it out. I guess we'll never know.

Anyway, I want to thank you and Meiks for everything you've done for us. For the Hoshikuzu, for the Nassau and Hopewell, for Sulsia. For helping me with Kendra. I know this really wasn't what you signed up for, I never wanted to drag you guys through all of this. Sulsia's been my home for a long time now. I owed it to this place to make things better. I hope that, in our own little way, we helped.

I don't know what your history is Ross. I don't care. I just want you to know that you've done good out here, and that's all that matters. I'm forwarding double your share of Lightowler's final payment. You deserve it."

5153, "Everyone here on Covenant thanks you for helping us realise our dream. You should gather your forces and leave promptly. This is not a welcoming place for those who aren't the Lord's Chosen."

5154, "Confirmed. It's the same as when Gadaria attacked us in the Veil. There has to be an interdictor ship nearby."

5155, "We'll deal with that when the time comes. We've got incoming ASMs."

5156, "We're going nowhere until that interdictor ship is destroyed. Can anyone get a lock on that signal?"

The Euphrates and Artemis will spend the next week undergoing repairs at Durius Installation. I've authorised leave for the ship's staff and air crew.

Ahab, I hear our newest pilots are yet to receive call signs. Take the opportunity to hold a Naming. Durius Installation has decent recreational facilities - just keep the noise down.

High performance small craft have significant thrust to mass ratios that subject their pilots to pronounced stress when accelerating. Pharmaceutical therapy allows pilots to tolerate - and survive - these G-forces.

Known as the 'cocktail', the drugs are a combination of inotropes, stimulants and vasoconstrictors to increase cardiac output, cerebral perfusion, cognitive speed and alertness.

Your performance today was commendable. Despite running into half the Combine fleet, we managed to secure a data cache from their research base. Analysts are already at work decoding the contents and I'm told the revelations will be shared on a need-to-know basis.

I'm placing the Artemis on extended condition two in accordance with orders by Rear Admiral Akrami, and returning us to Durius. Jump Five shift rotations will be posted out over the next hour.

Fifth fleet has been pulverised by the Combine. I command what little is left. The Combine have initiated a full scale invasion of Morik and we're continuing the fight as best as we can. It's a real mess out here.

XO, bring them downside. There's plenty of spare quarters for them to occupy. You two will  hear from me soon. The fight for Morik's nowhere near over. "

The Combine Navy battle doctrine emphasises overwhelming 'First Strikes' with large-calibre weapons and heavy missiles. Combine battlecruisers with their balance of mobility and firepower are the product of this doctrine.

The icing on the cake is the destruction of the cruisers Venturous and Stella Polare. More strain will be placed on Romanowska's remaining forces in Morik.

Fifteen minutes ago, nuclear bombers flying off the carrier Imperatrix glassed Juliet Base. We'd already secured all the supplies we needed and took no further losses, but the base is now a tomb.

We've had a preliminary look at the Combine research data. As expected, there's high-level encryption. The algorithm is one that Federation Defense Intelligence uses. Without an FDI counter-algorithm we can't decrypt the data. The Combine get to keep their secrets for now.

You'll be pleased to know the Juliet hangars contained Phantom-class stealth fighters in spaceworthy condition. With some minor maintenance they've been made mission ready and should be available for deployment at the next sortie. Yeah, I knew you'd like that.
"

Just so we're clear, I don't want what we're about to discuss spreading freely through the ship. Bad for crew morale. Limit discussions to senior officers only. 

We're in a bad spot. Task Force 57 is gone. Fifth Fleet is gone. I've heard nothing from Lincoln and Akkad. We may have to scrap our plans of retaking Morik.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, I don't get to make that decision. What happens next is up to Admiral Colvin.

Your mission is complete, McKearney. Pace will debrief you. The decrypted Juliet base data gives us the last clue that we need, a set of coordinates where we can find the source of the Federation's - now Combine's - superweapon. Your performance has been commendable and I'll note as such in your file - strictly off-record, of course.

We're chasing the greatest threat to the Commonwealth ever faced. It's nothing less than Armageddon. A planet-destroyer, perhaps something more. Bombing Earth in the last war wasn't enough for the Atlanteans. Now it seems their own weapon's been turned against them. Unlucky sods.

Our mission is to find out what exactly the Combine stole from the Federation, capture it if we can, and destroy it if we can't. These are orders straight from His Majesty King Edward himself. 

The Merlin's going to Mira. The Combine base which your Artemis assaulted was a secret Federation Defense Intelligence facility that the Combine commandeered several weeks ago. The Artemis assault was FDI covering their own backsides. Something's in that system that the Federation wanted to keep hidden, and we're going to find it.

Lieutenant Ross, thank you for your assistance in giving us this breakthrough. Be advised that everything you've learned today is classified. Once we're out of Morik I'll make plans to exfiltrate you off the Merlin."

5817, "Hi Stuart. Welcome to Sulsia. Thanks for applying for my job listing. I hear you've come all the way from the Alban Commonwealth."

5818, "I'm Katherine Lau, captain of the corvette Hoshikuzu. I'm putting together a crew for some contract work. I could use a good pilot."

5819, "Sulsia will be our area of operations. It's out in the fringes of colonised space but it's still a major trade hub. The Sulsian Hegemony exports a large number of mineral resources for manufacturing."

5820, "It's a huge frontier and the Sulsian navy's spread thin. Alban Commonwealth cruiser patrols used to keep order out here but with the war and all, they've all been pulled back home."

5821, "Now the trade corporations are having to fill the gaps left behind by hiring independents for security. This is a good opportunity to make some coin."

5822, "As far as I can tell your certifications look good enough, but I want to see your skills for myself. The Hoshikuzu's still undergoing upgrade work so I'm taking the opportunity to run a performance assessment."

5823, "I've accepted a contract on your behalf from Lupe Ferris, the Overton station master. A single pilot like yourself should be able to pull this off."

5824, "As you've probably seen on your way in, Overton Orbital is a graveyard for decommissioned ships. Station salvage drones comb the field for useful scrap which gets processed here and then sold on the market."

5825, "Ferris says several drones have been lost while on salvage missions - as in, more and more aren't returning to the station."

5826, "These drones work autonomously, they aren't tracked or kept in sensor contact. A lot of this is unavoidable, the debris creates a lot of signal noise."

5827, "The station sensors have also detected low-energy signals out in the field. The debris chunks are all inert, so there shouldn't be anything out there."

5828, "Ferris wants someone to go out and see what's generating those signals. If you can find out what's happening with the drones, that'll be a bonus too."

5829, "Your gunship is berthed in the station hangar. She's one of two custom-built craft."

5830, "They were both in pretty good condition when I found them in the Overton field, and with modifications they're tough little birds."

5831, "We might as well use the opportunity to see how well they fly with a pro at the stick."

5832, "So, that's your mission Ross. A little ghost-hunting to start off your time here. I'll talk to you again when you're out in the field."

5835, "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU"

5836, "Welcome aboard, newcomer! Please take a moment to read through this orientation guide to familiarise yourself with the Hoshikuzu and her crew."

5837, "The Hoshikuzu is a one-of-a-kind corvette that started life as a Rasputin-class transport before being sold for scrap."

5838, "She was salvaged and converted into an armed corvette by Katherine Lau, her current captain."

5839, "Her reactor and impeller was replaced with a military-grade unit, and her engines operate at more than two hundred percent efficiency. She is a hare with a lion's heart."

5840, "Along with her new 40mm chaingun PDCs, she carries two gunships and several repair drones for support."

5841, "Katherine Lau is the ship's captain. She decides who joins and leaves the ship. All who work hard are welcome. Those who misbehave are asked to leave."

5842, "Derek Kaur is the ship's engineer and keeps the power running. He's a Great War veteran, and he loves only vodka more than machines."

5843, "Verma Erikson runs tactical and weapons. She's a mystery but no one knows guns better than her. If you manage to find out anything about her past, share it with me."

5844, "Dodo Meiks is one half of the gunship pilot team. He's a Caledonian through and through and is the only one that can match Kaur drink for drink."

5845, "Finally there's Stuart Ross, the other gunship jockey. He's a bit of a lone wolf, but you can depend on him for anything."

5846, "I hope your time aboard the Hoshikuzu is a positive experience. If you have any questions about this orientation guide, just send over a comms."

5847, "DEREK KAUR - HOSHIKUZU"

5848, "Kaur"

5849, "Hello Ross. You're probably wondering how I fit into this family. A few weeks ago I helped Lau outfit the Hoshikuzu with the new reactor, and I figured I might as well stay for the ride."

5850, "Lau's rewarded me with the jobs she doesn't want to do herself, so I'm running double duty on reactor and gunship maintenance. I'll be the one maintaining your craft."

5851, "I don't know if Lau told you yet, but I think you should know ahead of time. I'm Combine, of old Sol vintage. I remember when we used to rule the galaxy, back before the Great War."

5852, "These Sinarussians, they do things a little differently but I don't follow most of it myself. I leave the politics to the politicians. You live long enough, you make peace with the things you can't control."

5853, "So, your gunships. They're versatile little machines that can mount most weapon systems out there. Right now we're limited to basic equipment, but things will change when Lau gets us some more advanced weapons."

5854, "Unfortunately I can't do much about their agility. Having said that, the engines are powerful enough and can get you to a decent speed, so long as you fly in a straight line."

5855, "Anyway, it's good to meet you Ross. If you need anything for your gunship, or just want advice from someone who's seen it all, come find me. Welcome aboard."

5856, "Hey Meiks, Ross. Look who's just scored our first contract?"

5857, "Our client is Trinity Holdings, a major trade cartel headquartered here at Azar station. They've posted out a contract to investigate a distress call from one of their freighters."

5858, "The call came from the Compass Rose, a cargo freighter enroute to the Multnomah system. She dropped out of hyperspace with an unspecified 'engine failure'."

5859, "The Compass Rose dropped out near several star systems with known pirate activity. She's a sitting duck for vultures looking for easy prey."

5860, "No details on what to expect, but the Hoshikuzu and your gunships should have more than enough firepower to deal with any raiders we're likely to encounter. Your gunships are fully stocked with kinetic rounds and missiles."

5861, "Our mission is to safeguard the Compass Rose and her cargo while rendering assistance to her crew."

5862, "Since this is going to be your first outing with us, I'll go through the game plan once more before we head out."

5863, "Your gunships are too small to have their own hyperspace impeller, so you two will ride docked on the Hoshikuzu's fighter rails when we enter hyperspace."

5864, "Once we enter the area, undock your gunships from the Hoshikuzu to initiate flight operations."

5865, "You'll be weapons free after that. Watch your fire though, the Hoshikuzu may be armoured but I don't want her to take any more damage than she needs to."

5866, "That's all I've got for now. If there's no questions, get to your gunships. We jump when you're confirmed secure."

5871, "As I've said before this region's been descending into a shitshow for a while, but this is the worst it's been."

5872, "Word around the trade cartels is that there's worsening unrest with industrial workers all around Sulsia. Something's got the roughnecks riled enough to drop tools. "

5873, "The Sulsian government's deployed the Navy to clamp down on trouble spots, but the unrest is escalating all around Sulsian space. They're spread thin trying to cover everywhere at once."

5874, "We're going to be spoilt for choice with security contracts, but if the situation gets too messy I'm bailing us out of Sulsia."

5875, "I'll never choose a job that forces us to do terrible things to innocent people. However anyone who doesn't feel like they can continue here is free to leave."

5876, "Everyone on this ship is a volunteer, and I'll support whatever decision you make."

5877, "I got us a new contract. We're on security duty again."

5878, "We're headed to Korra Station, a silicon refinery in orbit of Rubedo."

5879, "Twelve hours ago the refinery workers staged a coup and stormed the station's CnC."

5880, "Thankfully no one was killed, but the facility is now in lockdown and all silicon refining has halted."

5881, "The workers have pledged solidarity to the Malika People's Militia, but the group hasn't claimed responsibility."

5882, "The mining corporation Energence Industries has contracted a troop transport to assault and take back the station. Our job is to provide escort and eliminate all threats."

5883, "Two missile corvettes have taken up sentry positions near the station."

5884, "They're essentially converted transports and shouldn't pose much of a threat to the Hoshikuzu. However they'll need to be dealt with before the marines can start their assault."

5885, "Before the assault can commence the station reactor needs to be disabled. This will cut power to the station and shut off the gravity generator."

5886, "This is the plan. The Hoshikuzu and transport Pollux Arrow will jump in outside of missile range to the corvettes and hang back."

5887, "We've attached an EMP mine to your gunship. You'll need to drop it off in proximity to the station's reactor. This means running a gauntlet of the missile corvettes to the station."

5888, "Once in position, detach the mine and move out of the area. The mine has a thirty second timer before sending out a powerful pulse to disable the station's reactor."

5889, "Once the reactor is down, the Pollux Arrow will begin her assault and breach the station."

5890, "Our job is to provide area cover during this phase of the operation."

5891, "I've checked with the Pollux Arrow and Energence Industries. This is to be a humane operation."

5892, "Energence Industries know that if things go badly here, it'll hit their bottom line. They're in full PR mode over this mess, and want this done clean."

; m14_vn.txt

5893, "I've got big news from the local feeds. The Motina Kometa crew just swore allegiance to Gadaria's Militia. They were the second largest Fringe group after the Malikans, and Gadaria's only remaining serious challengers."

5894, "The Malikans now have almost uncontested ownership of deep Fringe space, and enough military hardware to challenge the Sulsian Navy."

5895, "This is bad news. The only reason the Fringe groups hadn't overrun the Sulsian Navy before now is that they were competing with each other and disorganised enough to be suppressed piecemeal."

5896, "With the Fringe groups organised under one leader, the Sulsian government has upgraded the threat level to Severe. I'll keep a close eye out for more updates over the next few days."

5897, "Ross, we've finally invested in some new equipment for you and Meiks. Lau has to be the most miserly entrepeneur I've ever met."

5898, "You've got the option of Maxim cannons now. They're Federation-standard, firing solid flechettes instead of the Huaqing's explosive-tipped rounds."

5899, "This decreases the damage potential, but the rounds are faster and more accurate. Federation philosophy appears to be 'get enough ordnance on target, and the rest will sort itself out.'"

5900, "Like the Huaqings the Maxim pods are modular so it's a quick job to swap them out. Just let me know ahead of time."

5901, "Personally I don't care for them as much as the Huaqings but Lau says I'm just biased towards Combine equipment. They're there if you want them."

5902, "Ross, Meiks. This is probably a bad idea but we're doing it anyway. We've picked up a distress call from the Sulsian warship Protogeneia."

5903, "It looks like the Malikan militia's pulled off something big. They've ambushed the flagship of the Sulsian Navy, hit her reactor and left her adrift."

5904, "The Malikan warship Opus is bombarding the Protogeneia from range. Her capabilities are unknown, but she's bigger than the corvettes we've come up against previously."

5905, "The Hoshikuzu is the closest ship that can help. I'm bringing her in."

5906, "We're going in without much info but here's the best plan I've got."

5907, "Undock from the Hoshikuzu and move to defend the Protogeneia from incoming missiles. The Hoshikuzu will move to take up a defensive position alongside the battlecruiser."

5908, "We're going to try and buy time for the battlecruiser to restore power to her systems. The Opus is a lot bigger than we are and I don't plan to go near that ship."

5909, "The Protogeneia is a pre-Great War relic, but she's all brute and muscle. We just need to cover her while she restores power to her engines and weapons for a counter-attack."

5910, "I've been in contact with Latona waystation. Multiple Sulsian Navy ships are scrambling to assist, but none of them will arrive in time. We're likely be by ourselves during this engagement."

5911, "Everyone good? Ok. Let's go save some Sulsians."

; m15_vn.txt

5912, "LAU"

5913, "Okay. I've had my ear to the ground listening to newsfeeds and contacts in the merchant guilds. The general gist is that short of military convoys, commerce in Sulsian space is no longer feasible."

5914, "One in four transports aren't making it to their destinations. The Albans have withdrawn all of their convoy escorts for fleet duty. Same with the Jacobins, and the Rhenish."

5915, "The Sulsians are running out of ships. They don't have enough to cover the trade lanes and fight the Malikans at the same time."

5916, "I know it feels like we're abandoning Sulsia, but we're not equipped to fight a war. We'll have to come back when things settle down."

5917, "The Vicare system is looking like our best bet. It's the only supply hub in the region, so it's going to be a magnet for anyone fleeing the war zone."

5918, "Vicare is a border system, and it's the last port of call out of Sulsian space. Refugee and freight convoys have been gathering there over the past few days."

5919, "There'll be a chance to pick up a few escort jobs, and it's far enough away from the Malikan front that it's stable for now."

5920, "Something just came up. Ross has requested we divert to Kotus Anchorage, a Sulsian industrial hub. A large Malikan strike force is enroute and there's some civilians that need help."

5921, "Kotus is the site of an Alban Commonwealth embassy. The facility is evacuating its entire staff, and the transports need escorting out of the area."

5922, "They've sent out a call for assistance to secure the evacuation against a likely Malikan attack."

5923, "The evacuation is being hampered by heavy crowds. Thousands of people at the Anchorage are trying to get out of the system."

5924, "The transports are short-ranged and don't have intersystem hyperspace impellers. The Alban Commonwealth has dispatched the heavy transport Elgin to a rendezvous point in the system."

5925, "Other evacuations are taking place elsewhere in the system. The Elgin will be taking on passengers from these operations as well."

5926, "I know we've already made the decision to leave, so I wanted to run it past everyone first. Do we leave Sulsia now or do we help these Alban civilians first?"

5927, "All right. I guess that's decided. I'll let Kotus know we're on the way."

5928, "Oh, and Ross? Kaur's dug up some Vulcan medium cannons for you two to try out. I don't think we'll see any heavy bombers but they may be useful against Malikan raiders. Let him know if you want them loaded."

5944, "Yeah, right. You always had everything handed to you. You never had to struggle like I did. You never had to fight for anything."

5945, "But...I didn't...Kendra, I know it seems that way, but it's not true. I had my own struggles. I didn't ask for my parents to leave, or for me to be fostered into your family. I know it wasn't fair to you or anyone else."

5946, "It's too late for apologies, Katherine. You can't undo what you did. You can't change the fact that you betrayed me and sided with my parents when they kicked me out of the family. I can't forgive you for that."

5947, "I was a child! I'm sorry! What else was I supposed to do?"

5948, "You were a coward. You're still a coward. Hiding behind your hired thugs."

5949, "Enough, Kendra. We're getting nowhere. I've tried to reason with you, make things right, but you're not listening."

5950, "I want both of us to heal and move past this, but it seems you're not ready for that."

5951, "I'm not ready. And I may never be ready. So just leave me alone, Katherine. I don't want your help...or your pity."

5952, "Okay. I'll leave you alone for now. But understand if you ever come after me again, I won't hesitate to protect myself. And I won't hold back next time."

5953, "Ross, listen. I've got some big news. Master Badami of the logistics ship Hopewell has contacted me with an intriguing proposition."

5954, "The Hopewell is undergoing conversion into a light carrier. Vicare yards say she'll be ready for flight operations in just under a week."

5955, "Badami asked me to train his crew in strikecraft maintenance. In return he's loaning us two Warden fighters from the Hopewell's strikecraft complement. Yeah, I told you it was big."

5956, "If you're not familiar with Wardens, they are decent heavy fighters. The Sulsians make good use of them in their navy. They're cannons only, but can move better than your missile gunships."

5957, "Like the Comet gunships, I've modified them to accept modular primary cannon banks. You'll be able to fit one bank of light kinetics and one bank of medium cannons."

5958, "The only issue is the guns tend to overheat quickly. The frame wasn't really designed for heavy cannons. However, the platform's got a versatility you won't find outside of current-gen strikecraft."

5959, "I've kept them in storage in the Vicare Station hangars alongside your gunships. We should be able to bring them along to the Hoshi's next sortie."

5960, "As usual, let me know ahead of time so I can make them ready."

5961, "If you need to find me, I'll be on the Hopewell running deck training. See you soon."

5962, "Looks like our reputation precedes us. I've been approached by Reverend Lightowler of the survey vessel Pillar of Fire. He's been running the Children of Renewal operations here at Vicare."

5963, "Lightowler wants an escort for a mission out near the edge of the Pallavian Veil. If you're not familiar with the Veil, the closest border is at least twenty light years from here."

5964, "So it's definitely not a small journey, but we've got the time. The Hoshikuzu is fully repaired but the Vicare yards report Nassau will still need at least a week."

5965, "I'm not sure if you've ever been there. It's a huge multisystem nebula around a star cluster. The radiation and gravity makes it a volatile area of space."

5966, "It's a long way away from colonised space and far out of the way of major transit lanes. I'm not expecting any trouble, but I wouldn't want to sail through the Veil without a good astrogation suite."

5967, "I haven't seen any ship like the Pillar of Fire before. She looks...pretty unique. Her master assures me that her astro equipment is up to specification."

5968, "I don't know what Lightowler plans to do out in the Veil, but it seems like an easy enough job. The Renewal are planning to take the Sulsian refugees to the Covenant system in a few days to meet up with their congregation."

5969, "Lightowler wants the survey mission finished before they move out. He seemed to think this part was important."

5970, "I'll round up the rest of the Hoshi's crew. We sail in two hours."

5974, "Don' be too hard on yeself. Ye've got every reason to be off your trolley. Gadaria had us up against the ropes, and it was a damn well near thing. Don' care how ye release all that pent up trauma. We're still alive ta feel it."

5975, "So lad. Is this why ye kept in Akrotiri after your Fed rotation? Did something happen in Morik that sent ye on another mental break? Am just telling ye A understand, but Am going in a bit blind here."

5976, "Let's just write off the next couple days, give yeself the time tae get sorted. Don't worry about Lau. All come up with a good tale."

5977, "Hey guys, I've got some huge news."

5978, "It's official. Navo, Master Badami and I have joined forces. The Hoshikuzu, Pollux Arrow, Nassau and Hopewell now fly together as a team."

5979, "Considering we've previously worked closely with Navo and his marines, as well as Kaur working with the Hopewell's deck crew, this is probably all just a natural evolution of our relationship."

5980, "As part of the merge, Badami and Navo have agreed to give us access to their finances."

5981, "I've used a portion of our funds to refurbish the Hoshikuzu. The work will be done at Vicare station. With the Hopewell also being converted to a carrier, our group will be using almost all of Vicare's total yard capacity."

5982, "The Hoshi's going to be a whole new ship at the end of the refurbishment. Her drone bay and fighter maintenance facilities are being replaced with an ASM launcher."

5983, "This is a massive investment which I hope will pay off in the end. She's finally getting some teeth to match her lion's heart."

5984, "This means Ross and Meiks are moving out. The gunships will be transferred to the Hopewell's fighterbay along with both pilots. I'm sure you'll all be sad to see them go."

5985, "However, both Meiks and Ross will remain under my employment as part of the Hoshi's official roster. I'm not letting you two get away that easily."

5986, "Got a surprise for you Ross. I had some leftover funds after the Hoshi's refurbishment so I went shopping at Vicare."

5987, "The Hopewell is the proud home of two Tor-class bombers that I got for a bargain, along with a supply of Stiletto anti-ship bombs. They'll make up the Hopewell's heavy strike wing."

5988, "I want you to test out one of the bombers for me. We'll also use the opportunity to try out the Stilettos."

5989, "You, Meiks and I are taking a shuttle out to the Hopewell. From there we'll launch from the hangar and start the weapons test. I've got a test site set up in the nearby scrap field."

5990, "Obviously the Tor bomber is a lot heavier than your Comet gunship and even more sluggish. Today I want you to get a feel for how it flies in case you need to use it in the future."

5997, "I'm still not sure I did the right thing by Kendra. Maybe I should have tried harder to get through to her. All I wanted was to move on and make things better between us. Instead I've made things worse."

5998, "And if that wasn't enough, Gadaria ambushed us. God, I still get cold sweats at night thinking how close we came to losing it all. Just sheer dumb luck that got us out in the end."

5999, "Feels like one of these days I'll push Fate too hard, and her debtors'll come knocking."

6000, "Anyway, I've decided I'm going to fly with you and Meiks today. We're short on pilots. Erikson will look after the Hoshi while I'm out there."

6001, "We've got a good crew. If there's anyone that can get through these rough times, I suppose it'll be us. If we're still here it means we're doing something right."

6002, "Maybe we work so well because we're all so different. Everyone brings something new to the table. No weaknesses, no blind spots."

6003, "Maybe I should stop doing so much myself and let you all have a bit more autonomy. I'm just worried the Hoshikuzu's going to fall apart just because Katherine Lau decided to take a break."

6004, "Phew, sorry about that Ross. Must've been carrying a lot on my chest. I wasn't expecting any of this when I decided to go into merc work."

6005, "One thing at a time, in order of importance. We get this refugee convoy out. That's the number one priority."

6006, "Once the refugees are safe, we find the nearest Commonwealth port and give Kendra to the Albans. After that, I can finally sit down and work out where we go from there."

6007, "Do you think I'm being too optimistic, planning too far ahead? The future seems so muddy with all the things going on right now."

6008, "But I suppose I've got to. That's how we survive. Life goes on around us even when everything seems overwhelming."

6009, "Well, looks like work calls. The waystation sensor reports have arrived. Thanks for listening, Ross. I really needed it."

6010, "Looks like everyone's tuned in. Okay, let's start. Here's the situation."

6011, "Latona Waystation has reported Combine warships heading directly for Vicare station. They will arrive within the half-hour. We've run out of time."

6012, "The composition of the attacking force is hard to pin down, but the strength of their impeller signals suggest a battlecruiser task group at least."

6013, "Captain Oberthur has placed the Thanatos and her escorts at full combat alertness. The Atlantean Federation warships will occupy the Combine task force while the refugee transports clear Vicare station."

6014, "The Nassau and Hoshikuzu are not expected to fight the Combine ships, but are to stay with the convoy to screen against skirmishers."

6015, "I'm pretty damned glad. I don't fancy my chances against a Combine battlecruiser. Let the Federation fight the war, that's supposed to be what they do best right?"

6016, "While the Thanatos and her ships keep the Combine busy, the convoy will move to clear Vicare Station. Once at safe distance, the transports will jump out to rendezvous with the Renewal congregation."

6017, "For our pilots who haven't met Meiks and Ross, they're the two gunship pros from the Hoshikuzu. They'll be Alfa wing. Captain Lau is Bravo 1. Keep an ear out for her instructions and follow her target calls."

6018, "Everyone else will be distributed among Bravo and Charlie wings."

6024, "The loss of the Elgin was tragic but our embassy in Sulsia managed to evacuate with minimal casualties."

6025, "This attack on Commonwealth citizens wasn't a random Malikan raid. I'm afraid I must take partial responsibility."

6026, "Well-armed and well-resourced groups are after me, and unfortunately Commonwealth citizens were caught in the crossfire. When one can't find one's target, carpet bomb the ground around them and to hell with collateral damage."

6027, "I've come into information that certain powerful high-ups don't want released. Something to do with the Malikans' newfound capacity for war. As bad as the Sulsians are at keeping their own territory secure, they're not entirely to blame."

6028, "I was sent to find out who was supplying Andri Gadaria with weapons. The Malikans are a pawn in a greater game. We're now starting to find out who the players are."

6029, "The Crown may have need of your services soon. You can play at being mercenaries for a little while longer but don't drag your feet when Fleet calls. You still have your oath."

6033, "For those who have never been to Covenant, you're in for a sight."

6034, "Covenant isn't a system or a planet. It's a hyperspace capable habitat that's a hub for transports, freighters and refinery ships all in service with the Children of Renewal."

6035, "I've been there before. The Children of Renewal are good people. The refugees will be well looked after."

6036, "Our job will be done once we arrive in Covenant. Once our payment comes through, I plan to find a Commonwealth port to drop off Kendra."

6037, "The Nassau, Hopewell and Pollux Arrow are free to pick up extra contracts at Covenant to pay for running costs."

6038, "Thanks Lau. We should be fine for a while. The bonus pay promised by Reverend Lightowler is substantial. Almost unexpectedly so."

6039, "Interesting. I get the feeling Lightowler's free with his credits because he doesn't see a need for them anymore."

6040, "The Children of Renewal must be planning something big."

6041, "Good luck to them. In the meantime, we've decided Ross, Meiks and Lau will run escort during the final approach. Our fighters got shot up pretty bad during the escape from Vicare and several of our pilots are recuperating."

6059, "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings."

6060, "Artemis is a cruiser-carrier hybrid. She doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of the larger fleet carriers, but her heavy autocannons get the job done."

6061, "She's got a reputation in Fifth Fleet as a brawler. She thrives in close quarters combat, wading into groups with fists flying."

6068, "Task Force 55 is assisting the Elam Republic in their war against the Qahtadnan Union. Federation Defense Intelligence believes the Sinarus Combine has been providing military and logistical support to the other side."

6069, "President Fitzgerald wants our deployment to send a message. The Federation will not tolerate any Combine interference in our own backyard."

6070, "FNS Artemis's area of operations will be the Durius system, one of the Republic's mining hubs. Our task is to defend the system against Qahtadnan incursions. We can expect to take part in combat operations."

6071, "The Atlantean Federation has not declared hostilities against the Sinarus Combine. However any Combine forces identified in Durius are to be assumed hostile."

6072, "We arrive at Durius in seven days. All officers and crew are expected to be familiar with orientation material and emergency procedures before we arrive."

6073, "Good morning pilots. It's been a long journey but the Artemis has finally arrived at Durius. We've taken up station at Durius Installation, the commercial and industrial hub of the system."

6074, "This area's seen several engagements between encroaching Qahtadnan forces and the Elam navy garrison."

6075, "The local sensor system has been compromised. Our first priority is to reestablish this network. When this is done we can begin combat operations in the system."

6076, "Ahab and Ross, you'll be flying escort for the Sina, an Elam navy corvette."

6077, "Sensor platforms have been loaded onto the corvette for deployment. If hostile forces attempt to impede, you are authorised to engage and neutralise them."

6078, "Once all the sensor pickets have been deployed, Beta wing will launch to fly CAP."

6079, "Intelligence on Qahtadnan force composition is sketchy, but you're likely to encounter M-21 'Cobra' light fighters and A-15 'Stalker' strikers. These craft are Great War relics and should be no match for your Vipers."

6083, "Katherine Lau has already accepted the terms of our contract of employment. I thought it prudent you receive a personalised briefing. You're a King's Officer, even if you're still on half-pay leave."

6084, "First, a summary of the strategic situation and how it relates to our upcoming operation."

6085, "As you know, an unknown actor has been supplying the Malikans with high grade weapons, and setting them loose in Sulsia."

6086, "It's clear the intent was to cripple the Sulsian economy, and as a result undermine Commonwealth interests in the sector."

6087, "The identity of the supplier is unconfirmed, but we believe high ranking officers within the Sinarus Combine are involved."

6088, "The consequences have been severe. The Sulsian navy has been brought to its knees, and thousands of civilians in Sulsia have died at the hands of Andri Gadaria's militia."

6089, "ANI has also uncovered evidence of Gadaria organising the nuclear attack on Covenant."

6090, "For his crimes, the Crown Navy intends to help bring Gadaria to justice."

6091, "Crown High Command has identified two short-term goals in the Sulsian theatre. First is to apprehend or neutralise Gadaria."

6092, "Second is to identify the individual responsible for arming Gadaria's terrorist group and gather evidence against them."

6093, "We're building a coalition to challenge the Sinarus Combine. The more evidence we can bring to the table, the more support we can gather and the better we can offset the Combine's military power."

6094, "When war comes to the Commonwealth, we'll need all the advantage we can get."

6095, "All right Ross, Meiks. Your former masters have hired us for an operation against the Sinarus Combine. I figure since we're already enemies with their rear admirals we might as well go all in."

6096, "Commander Cameron's crew has finished their interrogation of Kendra. She doesn't know who her employer was but was able to give details of their intermediary."

6097, "Through Kendra's information, the Albans have identified a convoy which could give clues to her employer's identity."

6098, "The convoy contains three Sinarus-flagged freighters with a cruiser escort. Their destination is Guardador Station, a mining hub in Sulsia that was comandeered by the Malikans several days ago."

6099, "The cargo manifest on those freighters mentions heavy mining equipment but the Albans believe they're shipping weapons under cover."

6100, "The Albans want one of the freighters so they can dissect her cargo for clues. This is where we come in."

6101, "The Hoshikuzu will jump in just inside ASM range of the convoy and launch missile strikes against the convoy's escorts. The hope is that the Combine warships are lured into an engagement away from their charges."

6102, "Once an opening is made, you need to disable the astrogation systems of one of the freighters. This is critical. We cannot commit the rest of our group until we're sure the freighters won't be able to make a run for it."

6103, "Once this is done we'll call in the Nassau, Hopewell and the Aria to assault the Combine ships."

6104, "This is going to be a balancing act. As long as the Combine think they're dealing with a solitary corvette, they'll be less inclined to warp out."

6105, "One more thing you two should know. The Hoshi's drone bay got replaced by her ASM launcher, so you won't have any repair drones for the first part of the mission. Be careful out there."

6106, "I think that's it. Probably the most insane job I've ever accepted, but your Commander Cameron is paying us premium rates. It helps that I've got you two with me to help pull this through."

6107, "I got an urgent communication from Admiral Bertini's office. The old bulldog wants us flying alongside his flagship against the Malikans. He's got firm intel on Gadaria's location and he wants blood."

6108, "The terrorist leader has been tracked to Jotram Station, the logistical, military and spiritual heart of the Malika People's Militia. The place is a fortress, but Bertini wants us to crack it open."

6109, "The Sulsians didn't say why Gadaria withdrew back home after spending months in the front lines, though I'd bet good money the inbound Commonwealth battle group's got something to do with it."

6110, "It doesn't matter. The Sulsian navy has been crippled by months of Malikan hit and run attacks and most ships have been destroyed or are under repair. Admiral Bertini needs escort ships for the attack on Jotram Station."

6111, "Bertini's primary objective is to locate Andri Gadaria and bring him to justice."

6112, "Fringe law is relatively straightforward in this regard. Justice for the Sulsians means death, whether it's through a court-sentenced execution or missile warheads."

6113, "I've accepted his contract. I didn't even negotiate a higher payment. If Bertini wants to send Gadaria to hell, I'm one hundred percent on board."

6114, "Jotram Station is the hub of asteroid mining operations in the system. It was the site of the first worker rebellion that birthed the Malika People's Militia."

6115, "Bertini plans for it to be the site where the Militia dies."

6116, "Sulsian intelligence on the station is comprehensive. Jotram is heavily guarded by the cruisers Yama and Virago, and a screen of smaller corvettes."

6117, "The Protogeneia is the sole remaining heavy unit of the Sulsian Navy and will be the backbone of the assault. The Hoshikuzu and Nassau is to provide CIWS support against Malikan gunships and ASMs."

6118, "Bertini assures me the Protogeneia can eat the smaller Malikan ships for breakfast. What the battlecruiser can't do is counter small strike craft and missiles. We'll just have to do that for her."

6119, "Last time the Hoshikuzu faced off against Gadaria's ships, she was a converted transport with only a few light cannons as armament. This time she's a fully armed warship, and she's got friends."

6120, "It's time to buckle up. Today the Hoshi and Nassau go to war."

; m22_vn.txt

6121, "Lieutenant. My congratulations on your victory at Jotram Station. The entire operation was a risk but Bertini was never a man of temperance."

6122, "The strategic balance in Sulsia is shifting. I've been informed the Children of Renewal congregation is heading for the Pallavian Veil."

6123, "We believe this is one reason why the Malikans have halted their advance and pulled back. We're unsure how the Children of Renewal prompted this, as they have no military capacity to threaten Gadaria."

6124, "Admiral Cleghorn has authorised a light unit detachment to shadow the Renewal congregation. Due to the proximity of the Veil to Sulsia, we need to identify any possible threats to future Commonwealth operations here."

6125, "I want your ships with me when we escort the Renewal convoy to it's destination, and find out their intentions there."

6126, "Your Katherine Lau already has a professional relationship with Reverend Lightowler on Covenant, and I plan to take full advantage of this."

6127, "I've contacted Reverend Lightowler. He's given us the coordinates of the Children of Renewal's final destination. It's deep within the Pallavian Veil, off of all major cartographical charts."

6128, "This is the location of their 'Promised Land'. They're making the final journey with the entire contingent."

6129, "I've checked our long range sensors. There's a black hole orbiting a K-type star, but no detectable planets or other system bodies. Lightowler assures me the coordinates correspond to high orbit of an Earth-like planet."

6130, "It's possible the black hole or the Veil itself is confounding our long range sensors. If there is a planet out there, we might not be able to see it."

6131, "The Children of Renewal have shared their space charts with us. If we need to make our way out without Covenant, we'll be able to use their navigation data."

6132, "I suspect this is the last job that the Renewal are offering us. Lightowler's offering an astronomical payment for this job, enough for me, Navo and Badami to retire comfortably and the rest of our group to receive a generous payout."

6133, "I don't know if this 'Promised Land' is real. I suppose it doesn't matter. It's real enough to the Children of Renewal and that's good enough for my conscience."

6171, "You let yourself get into a turning fight against enemy fighters, you're not coming back alive. Never engage the enemy in a Hornet without support, you hear me?"

6172, "Sorry. High-G cocktail just kicked in. I'll see you at the briefing."

6173, "All right pilots. We're going on the offensive."

6174, "At 1255 hours, the Euphrates arrived in Durius. The destroyer will support the Artemis as part of a carrier strike group. Two Elam Navy corvettes have also been placed under joint command for this operation."

6175, "Our scouts have identified the Qahtadnan battle carrier Gharial, command ship of the Durius invasion force."

6176, "The Gharial is accompanied by a pair of support carriers, a wing of gunboats and light attack craft."

6177, "They've taken up station deep in the asteroid field, and we expect them to move against Durius Installation soon."

6178, "Admiral Akrami has authorised the initiation of Operation Chromite. Our mission - the elimination of the Qahtadnan battlegroup in Durius."

6179, "The strike group will consist of the Artemis, Euphrates and the Elam Navy corvettes all flying in close support. Our ships will punch through the Qahtadnan light units screening the Gharial before engaging the carrier herself."

6180, "The Gharial is armed with heavy anti-ship cruise missiles capable of doing significant damage to our ships. I expect you to maintain good area defense to nullify the anti-ship threat."

6181, "Ahab, Ross and Preacher will make up Alpha wing flying Hornet strikers. Raptor, Punchy and Hoser are in Viper fighters as Beta wing."

6182, "This operation, if successful, will secure Durius for the Elam Republic and cripple a large portion of the Qahtadnan navy."

6183, "The Artemis was built for fights like these. Let's show these Qahtadnans the door."

6185, "Major engagements in Durius and Akkad saw attacking Qahtadnan Union forces defeated by the Republic-Federation coalition."

6186, "In Akkad, the Qahtadnan flagship 'Al-Gazi' was destroyed along with several major warships."

6187, "Atlantean President Fitzgerald is expected to release a press statement later today outlining future military action in the Elam-Qahtadnan war."

6188, "A declaration of victory is widely expected to be in the statement."

6189, "In response, Combine warships have garrisoned the systems of Alphard and Actium as part of a massive military build up along the border of Combine and Federation space."

6190, "Archon Sarshar defended the action in a press announcement today."

6191, "Sarshar"

6192, "I will not sit by while the Atlantean Federation continues to threaten our systems."

6193, "This is a proportionate response to the Federation's flagrant disregard for international order."

6194, "The Sinarussian people would expect no less from their leader."

6195, "Analysts suggest Archon Sarshar intends to discard the terms of the Miranda Accord, with Sinarussian state officials openly proposing 'returning the borders to pre-Great War levels'."

6196, "CBN ANALYSIS"

6197, "This would place a significant portion of Federation territory back under Combine rule."

6198, "Alban Prime Minister Charles Evans warned that time was running out for a diplomatic solution to the crisis."

6199, "Evans"

6200, "No one wins in a war between the Federation and Combine. No nation - large or small - will escape its monstrous reach. It's in all our interests to promote a peaceful solution, whatever the cost."

6201, "There are some alive today who remember first-hand the horrors of the Great War. Only forty years ago, and yet we risk the same devastation if we stay this course. We'll have learned nothing."

6202, "CAPT MARIS RAMLY - FNS ARTEMIS, DURIUS SYSTEM"

6203, "All right. Back to business. It looks like the Sinarus Combine isn't done with us yet."

6204, "New orders have come from Command. The Artemis is being deployed to the Mira neutron star, located at the fringes of Elam space."

6205, "Intelligence data reports that the Combine have established a base in the system in violation of Republic sovereign territory."

6206, "Our mission is to confirm the presence of the base, secure the area and board the station to find out what the Sinarus Combine was planning in the system."

6207, "Command has given us no further intelligence on Combine motives, and I'm not going to speculate on what they're planning. Let's just say whatever it is won't be good for us or for the Elamites."

6208, "Now, you should know that we will likely be firing the first shots in a new conflict with the Combine."

6209, "I know you're all ready for this. We're part of the greatest military might this galaxy has ever seen and second to none. The bastards brought this on themselves."

6210, "If we do this right, we'll smash the Combine fleet and show the Combine they started a fight that they can't win."

6211, "Welcome to Mira. No inhabitable planets, scant resources, and no reason for anyone to stay longer than necessary."

6212, "Your guess is as good as mine why the Combine have set up shop here. We'll just have to find out ourselves."

6213, "We've confirmed the location of a Combine base and will proceed to secure the station."

6214, "Fifth Fleet Command has deployed the marine transport Sycorax to join us in Mira."

6215, "Recon intel puts the Combine aviation cruiser Semper Victoria on station at the base."

6216, "The firepower of the Artemis and her strike wings should be enough to resolve an engagement in our favour."

6217, "Integral to this will be the neutralisation of the Semper Victoria's Javelin ASM battery and air wing."

6218, "Once the area is secure, the Sycorax will perform a boarding action against the station."

6219, " Your job will be to cover the boarding operation against further Combine attack."

6220, "Razor, you're with Ahab on Alpha. Congratulations on the callsign. Raptor and Cook are Beta. Punchy and Soap will make up Gamma."

6223, "A Combine battlegroup led by the carrier Excelsior has attacked Elam and Federation positions throughout Elam space. Task Force 55 has exchanged weapons fire with Combine warships. These are the first confrontations of a cold war gone hot."

6224, "We've taken casualties but we've given just as good as we got. The Excelsior is sweeping through Elam space with her sights set on the Durius system."

6225, "I'm deploying the Colossus to intercept the carrier at Durius. If Durius falls, the capital Akkad is going to be the Combine's next target."

6226, "The Combine have finally shown their hand. Now it's time to finish this game."

6227, "This is it. The Combine have thrown down the gauntlet and invaded Durius as part of a coordinated multi-system action. Here's the situation."

6228, "Enemy disposition: The Combine command ship Excelsior is fifteen klicks out and approaching at flank speed. She's launched a wing of Ka-15 'Defender' fighters, but we expect further strike launches are on the way."

6229, "Artemis and Euphrates are maintaining static defensive positions alongside Durius Installation. Squadron wings are to take up security positions around the warships and provide an area screen."

6230, "The Excelsior carries a stockpile of the Combine strategic nuclear arsenal. We can expect the use of these weapons. Target her Eos missiles as a priority."

6231, "The carrier's heavy bombers also present a nuclear threat. Keep your eyes open for bomber deployment and prosecute these HVTs as necessary."

6232, "Admiral Akrami's dreadnought Colossus has been diverted from Akkad to provide support. We need to hold our ground long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

6233, "However, waystation sensors report additional Combine attack ships converging on our position."

6234, "It is likely these reinforcements will arrive before the Colossus."

6235, "We'll be outnumbered and outgunned for most of this battle, but Durius Installation does not fall, understand? The fort must hold."

6236, "Everyone that's fit to fly goes out today. We're about to hit a storm and need all hands on deck."

6243, "30 minutes ago, long range sensors detected a significant cosmological event in the Morik system."

6244, "A massive energy burst was detected, powerful enough to cause shockwaves through hyperspace."

6245, "My analysts believe this is the cause of the comms blackout."

6246, "A disaster of unprecedented scale appears to have happened at Morik. I am authorising a reconnaissance mission to the system."

6247, "Morik is a critical military and industrial hub, and was home to the bulk of Fifth Fleet."

6253, "Despite these setbacks, I know we're still more than capable of performing this mission."

6254, "Deck crews will notice the new complement of Thunderbolt interceptors."

6255, "Our mission parameters have changed. With the escalating conflict, we are progressing into an ASM-heavy combat environment."

6260, "I got a report from forensics after they dug through my bird - looks like a Combine shell tore through the air filter and gave me a dose of waste emissions before the safeties kicked in."

6261, "Anyway, I may grumble but I'm counting my lucky stars I'm still here. Doing better than a lot of other people."

6266, "We haven't really talked much but you seem like a good guy. You're an Alban like Raptor so you get bonus points."

6267, "Take care of Raptor while I'm gone, okay? You let anything happen to her, I'll come find you and kick your ass."

6268, "Ok Razor. I'll see you round."

6273, "Nothing's left on the surface but molten rock."

6274, "Our sensors are reading massive gravitational shifts within a relatively localised area in space."

6275, "Shear forces are causing extreme tectonic shifting on the planet's crust."

6276, "This appears to be the result of a massive, temporary gravity well in close proximity to the planet."

6277, "We have no idea what caused this, nor whether this is some sort of new Combine weapon."

6287, "There's much to do and little time to do it. Here's the situation."

6288, "Ten days ago a major engagement took place at Bulwark which resulted in the destruction of Fifth Fleet, and the devastation of Bulwark's surface. We call this the 'cataclysm'."

6289, "I don't know how, but the Combine kicked us in the ass so hard that we're still feeling it days later. All reports suggest it was some sort of superweapon of immense power."

6290, "It was a god damn massacre, and Combine forces moved in straight after. Intel is sparse, but we know Admiral Lucja Romanowska and her command ship Imperatrix leads the Combine occupation."

6291, "Anyway, there's hyperspace interference all through the system, making intersystem communications impossible. I've deployed couriers out to Shen Kuo, Akkad and Lincoln to establish contact with other Federation task groups. No reply as yet."

6292, "Once help arrives, we can assault Romanowska and her superweapon and take back Morik from the Combine."

6293, "That all comes later. Right now I have a mission for you. Briefing is at 1330hrs."

6294, "Lieutenant Ross. Lieutenant McKearney. It's your time to shine."

6295, "I'm sending you to Juliet Base, the command centre for Federation Defense Intelligence on Bulwark. It's got something we need. Recon sweeps suggest that Juliet Base survived the cataclysm abandoned but intact."

6296, "A few weeks ago, your Artemis assaulted a Combine station in Mira, and a data cache was retrieved. That data is now in Juliet Base. We believe the Mira data contains crucial information related to the cataclysm weapon."

6297, "Juliet just so happens to be a major storage depot for Fifth Fleet. A depot with supplies we desperately need."

6298, "You'll be accompanying the transport Rocinante. She's been modified to carry interceptors and will serve as your launch point once she is on location."

6299, "I'm sending the Uriel and Phoenix along. They'll be shuttling personnel to reactivate Juliet Base's automated systems."

6300, "Once on location, launch and sweep Juliet Base for hostiles. When the base is clear, the shuttles will dock."

6301, "Shuttle Uriel's mission is to restore power to the base energy grid. Once the Command centre is powered and online the Rocinante can spike the data network."

6302, "Shuttle Phoenix loaded with the rest of Longview's pilots will dock with the base hangars and identify any flight-ready craft to reinforce your air patrol."

6303, "Securing the Combine research data is the primary objective. Once that's done and the area is secure of hostiles, the rest of the flotilla can begin procurement of the supplies."

6304, "Not to put too much pressure on you two, but this is our one and only chance to make this work. Good luck out there."

6305, "Ross, McKearney. Lieutenant Wade Murphy. CAG of what passes for the Longview's fighter wing."

6306, "Lancaster will probably have my head over this, but you should know what you're getting into. Things are bad."

6307, "Most of our pilot reserve was lost at Fifth Fleet HQ. We've been using conscripts and national servicemen in our combat wings. These are people used to flying logistics freighters."

6308, "We're days away from running out of supplies and ammunition. Morale is rock bottom. We won't even last until reinforcements arrive. This is our last ditch effort to buy some time."

6314, "We're also monitoring the situation on the Morik war front. It looks like the entire Federation defense line is collapsing."

6315, "Someone in Federation Defense Intelligence buggered up, hard. The Combine used FDI's research data to build their superweapon, and the Feds just let it happen."

6316, "I'm talking about Solaris, and that data package you lot picked up in Mira. We suspect it goes back all the way to the beginning of the Elam war. The Federation weren't supporting the Republic out of friendship."

6317, "The Federation occupied the Mira system months ago, and that 'Combine' base you attacked, was actually FDI's."

6318, "The research base was destroyed before we could move in and salvage the data. However, it seems we got lucky."

6324, "The carrier entered Morik fifteen minutes ago with the Combine dreadnought Vindicator in pursuit. From Combine comms traffic it looks like Romanowska has also sent the Veritas to intercept."

6325, "The Osiris' fighter reserves have been spent. Without fighter cover she won't last long against a Combine dreadnought and battlecruiser. How do you all feel like playing heroes today?"

6326, "Ross, McKearney. You're Alpha wing. Both of you are the CAG's first choices for flight duty, so you'll fly the Phantom stealth fighters."

6327, "Phantoms are good at setting up ambushes against strikecraft and warship turrets. Use them well. They won't even see you coming."

6328, "Murphy, I want you to pull up a roster of who else we've got available. If they can hold a stick, they fly. No one gets to sit this one out."

6329, "XO, set a condition one throughout the ship. We jump in five minutes."

6330, "Hey. This doesn't look good. The Osiris and Task force 57 were stationed at Shen Kuo to garrison the system against Combine attack."

6331, "It was a powerful task group. Our entire operation here depended on Colvin's ships coming to our rescue."

6332, "If the Osiris is here, maybe Task Force 57 got hit by the Combine too."

6333, "Not that it changes anything. We do the mission. We get the Admiral out of there alive. Lancaster can sort that shit out later."
