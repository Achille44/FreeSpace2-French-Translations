; FreiRaum tstrings Readme
; FreiRaum follow a strictly organization in its tstring files that make edits and searching much easier.
; Next in order of appearance within the game it is also ordered by importance.
; Follwing order is used and is so recommend:
; (Specific .tbms should only added after the main .tbl file.)
; tips.tbl
; help.tbl
; mainhall.tbl
; cutscenes.tbl
; credits.tbl
; rank.tbl
; medals.tbl
; ships.tbl
; weapons.tbl
; species.tbl
; hud_gauges.tbl
; messages.tbl
; traitor.tbl
; campaign and missions in order of appearance.
; for the campaign and missions it is recommend to use a -tlc.tbm file especially for that one. FreiRaum uses the name of the campaign file for campaign specific tstrings. Files named Single and Multi for the corresponding missions are also used if available.
; If you create an expansion or sequel that only add new things, add these in the aforementioned order after the last string id from the base modification. Of course a own -tlc.tbm file is strongly recommend in this case.

Développé en tant que chasseur d'interception/reconnaissance dans les premières années de la guerre vasudo-terrienne, il a également fait un formidable opposant contre le PVF Anubis et d'autres chasseurs vasudiens des débuts.

573, "L'Apollo vieillissant était autrefois le chasseur le plus courant de la GTA, et il est encore en assez grand nombre malgré les lourdes pertes subies pendant la Grande Guerre. L'Apollo est très polyvalent et peut remplir de multiples rôles, notamment la supériorité spatiale, l'interception et l'assaut. Sa principale faiblesse réside dans sa compatibilité limitée avec les armes en raison de sa structure vieillissante. Toutes les variantes de bombardiers ayant été retirées du service actif, la GTA est en train de décommissionner progressivement ces chasseurs au profit de nouveaux et plus performants, comme les Ulysses et les Hercules, à mesure qu'ils entrent en production à grande échelle."

574, "GTF Valkyrie"

575, "Intercepteur"

576, "Chasseur de reconnaissance et d'interception de bombardiers à grande vitesse.  Offre une grande compatibilité d'armes et de charge utile."

577, "En utilisant l'ancien chasseur éclaireur GTF Angel comme modèle, le GTA a créé le chasseur intercepteur Valkyrie. Il possède deux moteurs supplémentaires, ainsi qu'un ensemble supplémentaire de points d'appui primaires. Cela fait du Valkyrie le meilleur intercepteur de bombardiers de la flotte. Sa vitesse est inégalée dans la GTA, et sa maniabilité est supérieure à la moyenne. Ses seuls inconvénients sont une petite charge utile secondaire et une coque fragile."

582, "L'Hercules est le pilier de la flotte terrienne. C'est aussi le chasseur le plus lent et le moins maniable de la GTA. Cependant, cela est compensé par son armement et son bouclier très puissants - le Hercules transporte six armes primaires, ainsi que deux emplacements secondaires complets. Ce chasseur d'assaut lourd est le plus adapté aux attaques de petites cibles et à l'escorte de bombardiers. Il est largement admis que le Hercules est le chasseur qui a gagné la Grande Guerre, et avec son impressionnant état de service en termes de nombre de victimes de chasseurs et de vaisseaux de guerre, il pourrait bien l'être."

588, "Développé lors d'une opération conjointe des gouvernements vasudien et terrien, le GTF Ulysses est un excellent chasseur polyvalent. Il offre une manœuvrabilité supérieure et une vitesse de pointe élevée. Cependant, sa coque est plus fragile que celle d'un Valkyrie et il ne possède qu'un seul emplacement secondaire. Malgré ses faiblesses, il a un taux de survie élevé en raison de la finesse de son profil. L'Ulysses est actuellement produit en masse."

L'OpEval lui a donné des notes élevées pour sa vitesse, sa maniabilité, son blindage et son chargement. Une configuration de coque ultra-efficace offre de la place pour trois systèmes d'armes secondaires, une première pour les chasseurs vasudo-terriens. Cette polyvalence permet aux escadrons Myrmidon de remplir toute une série de rôles de combat, de l'assaut léger à la reconnaissance lourde. Les pilotes habitués à l'Ulysses déplorent cependant son profil et son inertie massifs."

597, "Conçu par les ingénieurs de la GTI, le Loki est sans aucun doute le meilleur engin de reconnaissance en service dans l'espace terrien ou vasudien. La forme de sa coque et sa chambre de réacteur blindée se prêtent à une faible détection des capteurs, tout en étant capable de manœuvres à très grande vitesse. Son armement relativement léger et son faible blindage le rendent inadapté aux combats prolongés. Une faille dans la furtivité du Loki a été découverte lors de la rébellion de la GTI, mais il est toujours déployé dans le cadre de missions de contre-espionnage et d'opérations spéciales contre des cibles qui ne disposent pas des mises à niveau matérielles nécessaires."

598, "TF Shrike"

599, "Trenton Industries"

600, "(fr)Phased out at the early stages of the Terran-Vasudan War, the Shrike is an obsolete interceptor design favored by mercenaries and other frequent users of the black market. Some models still in use have been refurbished with modern systems salvaged here and there, such as recent afterburners and shields. They are hardly a threat to any modern fighter in the GTA fleet and prefer to flee once confronted by superior fighters, but caution should arise when they arrive in swarms, especially if there is something for you to escort.

The GTA considers the Shrike a class E threat."

601, "(fr)TF Mustang Alpha"

602, "(fr)Northrop-Grumman"

603, "(fr)Cutting edge at the beginning of the T-V War, the Mustang series of fighters has long since been discontinued and dropped from active service in the GTA. While it was once a capable fighter, it is now considerably less survivable than an Anubis or uncloaked Loki. It is estimated that two of these fighters are needed to defeat just one Apollo fighter. In practice, given the irregular nature of their operators, a wing of four Mustang Alphas may be needed to pose a threat. Still, many spaceframes based off this design subsist among civilians and pirates who seek it for its costly-but-ease of retrofit.

They are considered a class E threat up until four of these appear."

This particular refit is owned by Arris Gavel. It features an additional secondary bay and reconfigured primary weapons. Scans also indicate increased energy output for weapon and engine subsystems as well as additional plating both internal and external."

607, "(fr)TF Ion"

608, "(fr)The Ion was originally used as a deep-space exploration and long-distance personnel shuttle in the years prior to the outbreak of the Terran-Vasudan War. Largely supplanted by the Elysium due to ease of maintenance, the Ion quickly fell into disuse. Retrofitted and equipped with limited armament, the Ion has since become a common sight amongst irregular militias and armed groups. Though they pose limited threat to fighters and bombers of the GTA, the retrofitted Ions may be able to cause significant damage to a fragile science cruiser or a poorly-defended transport.

The Ion is classified as a class E threat when facing fighters and a class D threat when convoys are present."

609, "(fr)GTB Athena"

610, "(fr)Light Bomber"

611, "(fr)Dynamic Metamer"

612, "(fr)Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Good speed for its size, with a high capacity afterburner reserve."

613, "(fr)The smallest bomber in the fleet, the Athena is scheduled to be superseded by the new strike bombers. Two of the contributing factors in this decision are the rise of heavier warships and the success of the Hercules assault fighter. The cost of upgrading these bombers to carry heavier torpedos also does not produce enough benefits according to many military technicians. Still, others say that there is a niche for these specialized bombers. The Athena is currently being relegated as a reserve bomber and will serve for years to come until its eventual retirement.

There have been reports of Athenas being found in illegal weapon caches. They should be classified as a class C threat."

614, "(fr)GTB Zeus"

615, "(fr)Strike Bomber"

616, "(fr)Poor"

617, "(fr)Excellent for hit-and-run bombing.  Can carry Tsunamis.  Good afterburner supply."

618, "(fr)Another product of GTI R&D, the Zeus strike bomber is a worthy successor to the Athena. Its balanced design and increased reactor capacity give it remarkable speed for a bomber, yet it still remains capable of carrying the powerful Tsunami bombs. These features will make the Zeus a versatile and effective weapon against capital ships."

619, "(fr)GTB Medusa"

620, "(fr)Heavy Bomber"

621, "(fr)Suitable for any size target.  Carries most missile types, but few cannons.  Armed with defensive turret, but still requires escort."

622, "(fr)The Medusa is the standard attack bomber in the GTA. Its strong shielding and large secondary capacity make it the favored attack craft against cruiser class targets. As the first bomber to carry the Tsunami bomb, the Medusa is considered the staple of any bomber pilot's career."

625, "(fr)Assault Bomber"

626, "(fr)Very Poor"

628, "(fr)The Ursa is the first bomber designed specifically for the purpose of annihilating capital ships. It carries a massive payload and is the only bomber in the GTA which can equip the Harbinger bomb. Strong shielding and hull make the Ursa very difficult to destroy."

629, "(fr)TB Mustang Beta"

630, "(fr)Fighter-Bomber"

631, "(fr)Precursor of the Apollo bomber variant, the bomber variant of the Mustang is equally appreciated by various civilians and outlaw organizations as a light missile platform. However, it is extremely costly for the average individual, so most of these variants fall in the hands of the professional mercenaries and major crime syndicates. It is illegal for most pilots outside of the GTA to possess bombers. Therefore, all unknown Mustang Betas pilots are to be investigated and, if found to be operating illegally, arrested. The fighter-bomber must then be returned to the GTA.

The GTA sets a minimum threshold for bombers as class D threats, so treat it as such."

632, "(fr)GTS Centaur"

633, "(fr)The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible. It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time. Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius. The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

634, "(fr)GTS Centaur#NonSupport"

635, "(fr)GTT Elysium"

636, "(fr)Since the unification of the Galactic Terran Alliance, this standard transport has been used by everyone, both civilian and military. A rugged power grid, highly standardized components, modular construction, and an efficient drive system all make the Elysium popular, affordable, and easy to maintain. While it has undergone minor changes time and again, it remains a simple design: a vehicle meant to transport personnel from one place to another."

637, "(fr)GTT Argo"

638, "(fr)In the Argo, the Elysium may at last have found a worthy successor. The Argo maintains all the desirable qualities of its predecessor, while adding considerable cargo space and armor at a reasonable cost. The Argo's spaceframe is completely unlike the Elysium's, however, complicating retooling of Elysium assembly lines. The GTA has offered incentive packages to any shipyards willing to go through the trouble, citing a desire to integrate Argos into its battlegroups as next-generation marine transports."

639, "(fr)GTM Hippocrates"

640, "(fr)The Hippocrates is currently being considered as a replacement for the crash-deployed GTM Florence. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates can also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Terran-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach. Considerable cost per unit and concern for patient wellbeing have together slowed deployment outside of core systems until the design has time to mature."

641, "(fr)Radar Dish"

642, "(fr)GTM Florence"

643, "(fr)The Florence is a relatively rare vessel that is designed to provide medical assistance in order to alleviate humanitarian crises at colonies such as Antares and Regulus. These vessels were hastily brought into service, utilizing repurposed retired spaceframes, and as such have questionable structural integrity. They are expected to be replaced by a more permanent solution sometime in the immediate future, possibly Subach-Innes' Hippocrates or Dynamic Metamer's proposal for a medical-variant Faustus."

644, "(fr)Bridge"

645, "(fr)GTG Bromios"

646, "(fr)The Bromios is a gas miner designed specifically to collect and process gasses found in the atmospheres of gas giants. Gas miners gather hydrogen and helium elements as well as compounds such as methane and ammonia which are broken down into their constituent elements. These gasses are then transferred to gas refineries where they are processed to isolate the heavy isotopes needed to power the reactors of vessels in the Terran fleets. Gas miners are large, slow, bulky and poorly armed, making them prize targets for pirates and other enemies."

647, "(fr)Collector"

648, "(fr)GTFr Poseidon"

649, "(fr)The Poseidon is the standard military freighter in the GTA. It is designed to protect its cargo from any kind of attack, and has four turrets with which to do so."

650, "(fr)TC 2"

651, "(fr)The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTA for deep space cargo transport. It has all the electronics and systems needed to preserve any cargo within it at whatever conditions are necessary. TC 2s are cheap to manufacture and are heavily used throughout the Alliance."

652, "(fr)TSC 2"

653, "(fr)The TSC 2 was developed when Terran Command decided it needed a stronger and more secure cargo container for use in military operations. It improves on the established TC 2 design by sacrificing a small amount of internal space for a significantly stronger hull. Although it is still not as strong as the TAC 1, the TSC 2 is usually the GTA's container of choice for cargo with military value."

654, "(fr)TTC 1"

655, "(fr)The TTC 1 is another example of civilian equipment used by the GTA League of Defense. It is primarily a tech container used for research purposes, especially zero-G development operations. It is not very strong, however, and is often a target of enemy attacks."

656, "(fr)GTFr Chronos"

657, "(fr)The Chronos is a freighter of civilian design. As the Terran-Vasudan war dragged on, more and more of these vessels were commissioned by the GTA for use in military operations. The GTA is still commisioning Chronos freighters because these slow vessels are quite durable. However, the request for Chronos freighters have slowed, and the GTA has at least initiated a competition for a new military transport as a successor to the Chronos. Several manufacturers have already placed bids, including Triton Dynamcs, Subach-Innes, and RNI Systems. All three corporations are bidding with their latest freighter designs: the GTFr Triton, the GTFr Albanus, and the GTFr Atlantis."

658, "(fr)TAC 1"

659, "(fr)The TAC 1 (called the TacOne by most pilots) is a heavily armored container, usually used for carrying volatile or dangerous substances. It is also the preferred supply container for use in front-line operations."

660, "(fr)GTFr Triton"

661, "(fr)The GTFr Triton hauls almost twice the tonnage of the Poseidon class freighters that have served the Galactic Terran Alliance. The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

662, "(fr)TC-TRI"

663, "(fr)TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTA reuses the containers in many capacities."

672, "(fr)GTSC Faustus"

673, "(fr)The Faustus science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft. However, in the years starting from the Terran-Vasudan War up until the destruction of the Lucifer, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research. The Faustus became famous for developing the Avenger cannon and reverse engineering shields from the Shivan invaders. It is also infamous for being poorly armed. Its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships, hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle. Be on a lookout for hostiles attempting to hijack these vital ships."

674, "(fr)Solar Panel"

675, "(fr)GTC Fenris"

676, "(fr)The mainstay of the Terran fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes. From bow to stern a Fenris measures 260 meters. With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in. The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate. During the post-war, the Fenris are being used as strike cruisers and to defend fast-moving convoys."

677, "(fr)GTC Leviathan"

678, "(fr)Built by Han-Ronald engineers as a defensive cruiser, the GTC Leviathan excels at its task. Slow and unmaneuverable yet strong, Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. Almost all of the Leviathan cruisers have different armaments because of the on-and-off nature of its production. Their hull strength and speed remains the same, however."

679, "(fr)GTD Orion"

680, "(fr)The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA. Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for three years. There is no more important symbol of Terran pride than a ship like the Bastion or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety. In the course of the Great War, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat."

Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

691, "(fr)GTI Endymion"

692, "(fr)The Endymion is an ancient space station design, dating back to the early Terran-Vasudan War. Faced with a pressing need to coordinate forces across and even between systems, the nascent Terran Alliance devised the Endymion as a theatre C&c platform, incorporating sophisticated (for the day) long-range sensors, secure comms, and subspace listening arrays. As the war ground on and brought with it new technological innovations, a single, central communications hub became more of a liability than an asset, and the Endymion class was mothballed as soon as battlegroup comms could do without it.

The Alliance invested very heavily in engineering the Endymion, however, and contingencies remain in place to reactivate them should the need arise. Indeed, in the post-Great War economic decline, the reactivation of old stations is increasingly seen as a plausible alternative to constructing new ones, and several Endymions have been sold off to civilian interests. Conspiracy theories abound about pirates, GTI remnants, and Hammer elements repurposing forgotten Endymions to their own purposes, but none of these rumors have been substantiated."

693, "(fr)Solar Cell"

694, "(fr)GTI Acheron"

695, "(fr)The Acheron was constructed with extreme durability before all other concerns. The design features copious armor plating, auto-repair systems, and an extremely costly power plant capable of recharging directly from an internal subspace gateway. Three Acherons were created in obscure, inaccessable locations during the Terran-Vasudan War as a last-ditch survival mechanism, and reactivated during the Great War for the same purpose. Owing to the design's extreme resiliency, fear of Shivan return, and the exorbitant material cost invested in building them, all three remain afloat."

696, "(fr)GTI Asteria"

697, "(fr)The GTI Asteria is a station originally desgined for commerce and trade, with its nine docking points and the ability to station at least one wing of fighters for patrolling purposes, the station is well fitted to serve as a hub for trade in a system. As Asteria class staions are easy to set up, this class of station has become the GTA's choice for supply outposts in contested areas. With 24 turrets, the Asteria's self-defense is outstanding for an installation of its size, but due to the limited durability of the construction, fighter cover is advised."

698, "(fr)GTI Arcadia"

699, "(fr)Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia class station was commissioned, GTA decided to reclassify it as an installation rather than a space station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia class installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability."

700, "(fr)GTI Arcadia#Antares"

701, "(fr)The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

713, "(fr)TM Arothron"

714, "(fr)Similar to the Fara-class Decoy Beacon, even a small network of Arothrons allowed for more precise derivation of subspace jump reversion coordinates. During the early years of interstellar warfare, the Arothron was used to ruthlessly execute close-quarters ambushes, or tactically inject reinforcements in a faltering defense screen. Better navicomps in modern day fighters has made the Arothron obsolete, though pirates, survey crews, and even backwater security forces are still known to field the aging platform. Late model Arothrons came with low-observability hull coatings, good to approximately 500 meters. Many have also been retrofitted with multi-warhead countermeasure packages that fire when the Arothron's chassis disintegrates, a potentially fatal surprise for complacent pilots looking for easy kills."

715, "(fr)GTEP Hermes"

716, "(fr)The Hermes escape pod has been used since the destruction of the GTD Goliath over thirteen years ago. They are used by the crews of destroyers and installations to escape destruction. It is always best to be prepared."

717, "(fr)PVF Anubis"

718, "(fr)Light Skirmish"

719, "(fr)Mekhu Enterprises"

720, "(fr)Lowest power Vasudan craft.  Offers little in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.  Best used in swarm situations."

721, "(fr)The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy. However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers. A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships. The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

722, "(fr)PVF Seth"

723, "(fr)Heavy Fighter"

724, "(fr)Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

725, "(fr)As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet. Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding. Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners. The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

726, "(fr)PVF Horus"

727, "(fr)Very Good"

728, "(fr)Akheton Corporation"

729, "(fr)Extremely fast with good weapons compatibility.  Very useful in any kind of engagement."

730, "(fr)The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA. This makes it extremely dangerous. Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy. This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.

As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible."

731, "(fr)PVF Thoth"

732, "(fr)Sahr Corporation"

733, "(fr)Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

734, "(fr)The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN. Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet. When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil. The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems. In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit. The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians. Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses class fighters. This is why they are considered a B class threat. Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

735, "(fr)PVB Osiris"

736, "(fr)Bomber"

737, "(fr)Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However, carries good payload including space bombs.  Most commonly used in cruiser strikes."

738, "(fr)The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations. It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor. It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity and is faster and more maneuverable.

The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris cruisers and a D class threat otherwise."

739, "(fr)PVB Amun"

740, "(fr)Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

741, "(fr)The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship. It has been replaced by the Osiris in the PVN fleet, but the HoL may still maintain these bombers. It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion class destroyers in the last two years of the Terran-Vasudan War. Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters. Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships. They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

742, "(fr)PVB Hesat"

743, "(fr)Hammer of Light"

744, "(fr)Snail is awesome, didn't you know?"

745, "(fr)This ship appears to be a product of the Altairian shipyards produced under Hammer of Light control. Manufactured in unexpectedly large quantities, these bombers appear to be designed as cost-effective, disposable units intended for use in swarm situations. Despite initial appearances, the Hesat should not be underestimated. It is deceptively agile and incredibly fast, while maintaining the ability to deliver a payload easily capable of shattering the armor of cruisers and other capital ships. Although incapable of carrying the heavier torpedoes, these ships are to be considered a significant threat due to their ability to slip through most defenses unimpeded. Their main weakness appears to be a below-average bomb capacity, relying mostly on a single initial payload to destroy their target."

746, "(fr)PVB Sekhmet"

747, "(fr)Vasudan-Shivan hybrid.  Fast and powerful."

748, "(fr)The PVB Sekhmet is a Hammer of Light ship that appears to be a fusion of Vasudan and Shivan technology. The Hammer of Light claims that its design was adapted from a new class of Shivan bomber heretofore unencountered by either the GTA or the PVN.

Sporting four primary weapon hardpoints and three missile bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch. Treat it as a class A threat to all allied capital ships."

749, "(fr)PVS Scarab"

750, "(fr)The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us. It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers. In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat. The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

751, "(fr)PVT Isis"

752, "(fr)The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size. Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally this class has been known to act as a repair ship or tugboat. It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position."

753, "(fr)VC 3"

754, "(fr)The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own. The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment. Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world. Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

755, "(fr)PVFr Ma'at"

756, "(fr)With three turrets, the Ma'at is a hairy target for GTA pilots to attack. However, it is slow enough that it can be destroyed with enough patience. Supply ships for the PVN are no longer considered to be valid targets, but any HoL supply ships can and should be destroyed or captured."

757, "(fr)VAC 4"

758, "(fr)The VAC 4 series of cargo containers is much like its normal counterpart, except it has much more plating. However, this container is no more dangerous than the standard version, and is nothing more than Avenger bait without protection of some kind."

759, "(fr)PVFr Satis"

760, "(fr)The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter. It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot. However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets. Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a class C threat. Treat it as one."

761, "(fr)PVFr Bes"

762, "(fr)Recently commissioned, the PVFr Bes is to be the next freighter of the PVN. Despite its unsightly appearance, its statistics excel on paper and is remarkable as a freighter, able to load and unload cargo at a faster rate than any freighter in existence. The state-of-the-art technology also enables them to be used as cargo scanners as well. However, these freighters are underwhelming in terms of armaments, costly, and more vulnerable than the Ma'at freighter. Their continued production is evidence that the PVE is willing to accept the costs."

763, "(fr)VAC 5"

764, "(fr)The Vasudan VAC 5 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

765, "(fr)PVT Sesmu"

766, "(fr)The Sesmu civilian transport is commonly seen within Vasudan space. The Sesmu's Mekhu ME-14g powerplant allows the transport to travel quickly for its size, making it one of the fastest heavy transports in its class. It is also favored for its sturdiness and carrying capacity but lacks the technology to compete with modern designs. Although many Sesmu will continue to be refitted and produced, the Vasudan Navy does not have any plans to adopt the ship, citing its light and dated armaments, large target profile, and slow-charging subspace drives as major design flaws. 

PVN ships are no longer considered valid targets. However, all Hammer of Light transports should be captured or destroyed. Because of their light armament and high tactical value, disabling and capturing these targets of opportunity is preferred over outright destruction."

767, "(fr)PVSC Imhotep"

768, "(fr)The PVSC Imhotep is the standard Vasudan research vessel. Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys. One major difference between the two classes is that the Imhotep carries a small podbay housing four remote research pods. These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems.

All hostile Imhoteps should be disabled or destroyed if the former is not an option. GTA and PVN intelligence both conclude that the Hammer of Light must be dependent on these vessels in order to develop new technologies and avoid capture. Intelligence also believes that the HoL uses Imhoteps extensively for religious purposes and propaganda. "

769, "(fr)PVC Aten"

770, "(fr)The Aten class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans' warships, falls short as an attack cruiser. It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry. With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size. Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

The Aten class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a class B threat."

771, "(fr)PVC Newet"

772, "(fr)The Newet was a prototype PVN design built shortly after the destruction of the Sol node. It was meant to go into full production at the Sahr Shipyards in Altair until the shipyards came under HoL control. Despite its relatively small size, the Newet possesses an impressive array of weaponry. Apparently geared towards anti-fighter duties, the Newet is commonly seen providing fire support to insurgent strike teams.

The Newet is considered a Class A threat to fighter pilots."

773, "(fr)PVC Mekhet"

774, "(fr)The Vasudan Mekhet class cruiser has remained in service since the early stages of the Terran-Vasudan War. Rarely encountered outside of the Vasudan core systems, these warships are usually seen reinforcing fortifications around vital installations and jump nodes. Among the heaviest cruisers in the Terran and Vasudan fleet, the Mekhet wields a large arsenal of weaponry including multiple missile batteries and heavy laser turrets. It has exceptionally strong armor plating for a vessel of its size. However, an unusually low cruising speed limits its tactical viability."

775, "(fr)PVC Selket"

776, "(fr)The Selket goes a long way to prove that every second model of Vasudan cruisers is a major success. Her sleek design can shrug off tremendous punishment, and her fearsome armament makes enemy bombers and cruisers think twice before engaging. The Selket is also particularly fast and capable of sub-atmospheric flight, and has the most advanced targeting systems in use today to destroy hostile fighters in minimal time."

777, "(fr)PVD Typhon"

778, "(fr)Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations. The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology. When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design. The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly. The Typhon should never be underestimated. It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer. Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected. There has only been a handful of these destroyers lost since it first appeared.

A hostile Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system. Do not engage without backup."

779, "(fr)PVI Cheops"

780, "(fr)Cheops are relatively cheap Vasudan structures deployed and anchored into asteroids to act as bases for extending the influence of the Vasudan Empire. They can be found in all systems where there is a Vasudan presence, including even the most remote ones. However, because of their dependence on asteroids they are deployed upon, they are extremely vulnerable to weapon fire. Asteroid bases such as these are used by both civilian and military contractors to mine resources and conduct experiments.

The Hammer of Light has been known to use Cheops as inexpensive and disposable outposts as well as the aforementioned roles."

781, "(fr)Array"

782, "(fr)PVI Abydos"

783, "(fr)The PVI Abydos is a smaller class of Vasudan space station, modeled after the much larger Karnak Class. Despite measuring less than 350m in diameter, the Abydos is remarkably well armed, with twelve anti-fighter plasma turrets arranged around its external ring, and a single, powerful anti-capital turret at the base of its central core. This asymmetric weapon arrangement, and the lack of a fighterbay, leaves the station vulnerable to cruiser assault, and as such they are rarely left unguarded by the PVN."

786, "(fr)PVSG Ankh"

787, "(fr)The Ankh is the standard Vasudan sentry gun. Its most common usage is guarding supply depots. However, since the development of the Anubis, its usage has dropped off significantly."

788, "(fr)PVEP Ra"

789, "(fr)The Ra has been used by Vasudans since our first encounter with them. Every Vasudan capital ship has a few of these lifeboats."

790, "(fr)PVC Aten#Hulk3"

791, "(fr)GTDr Phidias"

792, "(fr)Officially designated the Phidias by the GTA, this service craft has been in service since early years of space exploration before the formation of the GTA. The success and the historical importance of the Phidias is well-founded. It was the first ship designed to construct complex designs in space. Prior to the deployment of the Phidias, all spacecrafts were constructed on Earth and then launched into space, but this became impractical and prohibitively expensive. Engineers, scientists, and corporations took part in the design of the Phidias in order to maximize efficiency and versatility. Initially, the Phidias were manually operated, but technological advancements have gradually replaced those with the more-modular and cost-effective drone variants in the core systems. As a result, the Phidias became the most widely distributed spacecraft in Terran space. Because of the large number of contractors and variations, the Phidias has many brands depending on the owner. No other equipment has been able to compete against the Phidias successfully."

793, "(fr)GTDr 3301"

794, "(fr)Introduced as a smaller and cheaper cousin of the Phidias, the GTDr 3301's role is very specialized. When the job is too dangerous for a Terran or too small for the Phidias, the 3301s are deployed. Although slightly newer than the original Phidias model, the 3301 is far less advanced and considerably less adaptable. These drones contain only the most basic features and are usually teamed up with Terran construction workers or heavier equipments to assist them in their task. In systems where Phidias drones may not be seen, chances are that there will be 3301s instead."

795, "(fr)TT Proton"

796, "(fr)The Proton class transport is a light transport favored by celebrities and politicians for its eye-catching style. It is well armored but mostly defenseless, thereby limiting its use to a single system. Other common users of these transports include CEOs of important companies, scientists and academics, crime bosses, and the upper class elites."

797, "(fr)TT Cretheus"

798, "(fr)The Cretheus medium transport is a newer civilian design used to tranport large number of civilians to emigrate to other systems. It is very similar in capabilities to the Vidar. However, it trades armor for more speed. The Cretheus lacks the basic comforts that is afforded by other transports in order to raise the occupancy limit. Like most crafts, the Cretheus has received mixed reviews. Critics of the design argue that the transport is more hazardous for the transportees than the Vidar. Proponents believe that its speed will allow the Cretheus to get away from convoy raids better than any other competitor transports in its class."

799, "(fr)TFr Albanus"

800, "(fr)The Albanus is a medium-sized atmospheric-capable freighter. Though less massive than the Triton class, the Albanus is distinguished by its specialized cargo container. Civilian contractors utilize these vessels regularly because they are cost-effective and highly versatile. Many Terran systems use this freighter as a suitable prisoner transport. Subach Innes recently placed the Albanus light freighter as a bid for the GTA's next generation freighter competition."

801, "(fr)TC-ALB"

802, "(fr)The TC-ALB is the container used by the Albanus light freighter. Unlike most containers, the TC-ALB can be manufactured with various standards.  Their primary use at this point is for prisoner transport, but their potential suitability for large-scale evacuation procedures and as a logistics supply container have been investigated. TC-ALBs are among the most well-armored containers in production."

803, "(fr)TC A09"

804, "(fr)The A09 cargo container is an old civilian cargo unit. Its simple-yet-durable construction allows it to fulfill nearly all freight transportation and storage duties for any type of cargo."

807, "(fr)TC A17t#Demo"

808, "(fr)TGs Prominence"

809, "(fr)A mining vessel widely utilized in the outer fringe regions such as the newly colonized systems beyond Laramis. The Prominence was originally used early in Terran space exploration to mine asteroids and other deep-space objects. Many of these vessels have since been retrofitted by irregular groups, equipped with additional weapon mounts and heavier armor plating. Though incapable of mustering enough firepower to challenge larger capital ships, they pose a significant threat to unsupported fighter wings. It is recommended that all fighters stay far away from them and call for backup."

851, "(fr)The Atlantis is a large, multi-container freighter, used primarily by civilian freight operators. Though often termed a 'Megafreighter' or 'Superfreighter' in common parlance, this term is misleading - the Atlantis' twenty TAC 1 containers give it a comparable maximum dry-load to the more common GTFr Triton (although its maximum total capacity surpasses that of the Triton when its 'wet-load' of ten TGas 1s are taken into account). Rather than competing on sheer tonnage, then, the Atlantis is preferred by civilian contractors for its greater flexibility and superior compatibility with other freighter types. Additionally, many operators prefer the inherently decreased risk that comes from spreading cargo over multiple containers, rather than concentrating it into one unit, which may be damaged or destroyed. Moreover, the spartan design of the Atlantis means that is considerably cheaper to purchase and maintain than the Triton. However, these advantages come with their limitations - very large cargos, or bulk commodities are rarely moved efficiently by an Atlantis."

The first Constellations were launched in 2317 as zero-g manufacturing facilities, and many still serve in this role, however the simplicity of design and low price of construction has made these small stations attractive prospects for modification and customisation. Constellation variants can now be encountered performing a large number of additional roles, such as orbital dormitories, research outposts, shipyard control centres and customs depots. Although typically unarmed, the GTA produced a small number of lightly armed Constellations for use during the Terran-Vasudan war, and, although relatively uncommon, a small number of these are still produced to this day."

In its basic configuration, it is able to refine hydrogen at the isotopic level to yield deuterium and tritium for fusion reactors, as well as isolate an excess of twenty economically significant gasses through sequential or fractional differentiation.

More complex models can be configured for more advanced procedures, such as LTLD (Low Temperature Liquid Differentiation), allowing them to isolate dozens more rare gasses from extremely diluted feed stock. The Type-Two is the most common refining station in Terran systems."

Although not itself armed, the Comet's sophisticated network of sensors and communications allow it to integrate with and significantly enhance the defensive capabilities of the sentry cannon webs that are generally deployed with the station.

Designed with modularity and customisation in mind, the Comet is often altered to enhance it cargo storage or other capabilities. Common additions include cargo pads, additional storage facilities for atypical cargoes or additional habitable space. Further to this, the GTA have designed a variant with its own onboard weapons systems, for use in more volatile systems, but these are not presently available to the civilian market."

Armed with ten turrets, the Adonis can fend off a small attack force. Its relatively low cost makes it a viable alternative for those that need a simple base without all the luxuries and benefits of an installation. For these reasons, many Adonis stations are currently being built with some even being linked to major smuggler and pirate groups."

Extravagant living quarters, ballrooms (both with and without gravity), professional servants, and an integrated wildlife reserve all make the Nareos the dwelling of choice for wealthy travelers - and the permanent home of those who really want to show off. The population of the Nareos has fallen somewhat of late, as fewer people can afford to live on one in the post-War economic recession, and those who can are regarded with increasing scrutiny by an untrusting public."

869, "(fr)Orbital prisons are considerably different than ground-based ones. While the cost of shuttling prisoners into orbit is a concern, the ability to totally isolate the prison's docking bays make escape a non-issue. Neta-class orbitals take this a step further, placing the hangar, bridge, and environmental controls in a separate hull entirely, which can be reached only by hermetically-sealed monorail. Controversially, the station's medical facilities are placed in the same section. Neta stations are an unfortunate necessity of the post-War era, isolating violent criminals society can no longer afford to rehabilitate."

It is designed for the short range, short duration transport of people and light cargo in space. The base model is unarmed and incapable of atmospheric operations and subspace travel, although its long service life has led to the creation of a multitude of variants, many of which have some or all of these capabilities. The Mercury is one of the most common vessels of any type in the Terran military and civilian fleets. It is estimated that in excess of two hundred thousand of these ships have been created over the lifetime of the class, and many remain in service today."

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls makes it one of the best anti-cruiser weapons.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.

This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

These antimatter weapons do much more damage than our Phoenix V missiles, but are smaller than normal space bombs.  The Barracuda is favored by the Vasudans for attacks against cruisers and stationary installations.  Osiris bombers commonly fire these weapons in pairs for knocking out turrets on capital ships.  The Barracuda's targeting system is prone to malfunctions, and a common field modification is to bypass the aspect lock system completely, permitting dumbfire launches."

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.

The Serkr is a high-yield warhead developed as part of a top-secret GTI experimental weapons program. Sacrificing anti-subsystem capability for sheer hull-damaging power, the Serkr delivers a destructive payload 33 percent greater than the more common Tsunami. Like the Tsunami, the Serkr can be loaded on the Medusa medium bomber for tactical deployment -- and with a top speed of 95 m/s, this bomb stands a good chance of eluding even the fastest interceptor fighters.

1089, "(fr)During the Great War, the Shivan destroyers were, by all accounts, vastly superior to both the Terrans' and the Vasudans', able to annhilate either in minutes. In an attempt to turn the tide, the GTI Research and Development branch rushed to deploy their untested prototype torpedoes. However, after the unanticipated destruction of the Lucifer, GTI R&D issued an immediate recall, using the known flaws as a guise to pour vast amounts of fundings towards developing the Hades superdesroyer. Largely forgotten, the prototypes were only accidentally rediscovered when investigators were searching through the GTI records. 

After its re-introduction, the only working torpedo was renamed the GTM-205 Howell Torpedo. As the latest in destroyer technology, it signals the re-rise of the destroyer class. No bomber commissioned by the GTA has the capacity to carry even one of these.  The Howell is slightly weaker than the Tsunami because it sacrifices explosive yield for increased range. However, it also has a substantially higher refire rate than any bomber torpedo. Coated with the experimental partially-collapsed-core molybdenum, the Howell is the fastest and most durable bomb ever produced, making interception difficult.

Yet despite these advantages, the Howell torpedo is criticized for being too costly. Others question the GTA's reason for not disclosing the how they corrected the imperfections, such as the occasional lockups and early detonation that may occur within a destroyer. To them, the move is irresponsible. They request that the GTA be more transparent and to hire an independent research team in order to have the test be unbiased. Only time will tell if the torpedoes will continue to be produced in the future."

During the 14-Year War, the Vasudans believed that they would win the war when they witnessed the Typhon's first successful deployment. The Parliament quickly announced that a 'Destroyer Killer' would be added to the Typhon's already deadly arsenal. But soon after the declaration, the Aratrum project experienced large-scale corruption. Most of the funds allocated to R&D went into churning out more immediate-yet-disposable war machines such as fighters and transports. It was because of this that the Aratrum was installed after the Howell was recommissioned.

The strengths and weaknesses of the Aratrum remain classified, so no comparisons between the Howell and the Aratrum torpedoes have yet been made. Contradicting statements by the PVN and the PVE cause further challenges in determining the role of the weapon. Whereas PVN admirals boast the superiority of the weapon over the GTA's, the PVN officials downplay it as a defensive weapon. What we have been told is that the Aratrum carries multi-yield warheads, and its official test-flight revealed that it is capable of aspect lock.  The Aratrum seems to be limited to being equipped by capital ships only, but this remains to be seen."

1126, "(fr)Earth"

1127, "(fr)In 2335, the destruction of the Lucifer superdestroyer collapsed the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis, severing all contact with Earth.

The fate of the Terran home planet remains open to speculation, though a number of scenarios are possible. As the center of an interstellar community, Earth could not survive in isolation without a radical transformation of its political and economic structures. On this point, there is no disagreement. However, the question remains whether this transition occurred peacefully or whether Terran society collapsed into anarchy. Strong arguments have been advanced for both sides.

For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation-states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society.

Discovering the means to return home remains a high priority."

1128, "(fr)Antares"

1129, "(fr)Once a contested system, Antares is largely abandoned by both powers. This is where the first official contact between Terrans and Vasudans occurred. During the Terran-Vasudan War, Antares became a center of conflict because of its close proximity to Vasuda. Several events such as Operation Thresher, the McCarthy Incident, and the Shivans's first encounter took place in Antares.

Gulnara,  a moon that orbits Antares IV, is the most developed area in the outer region and is considered the central industrial hub of Antares and its neighboring systems. While its air condition and pollution level is worse than the standards in the core systems, the quality of life in Gulnara is better than anywhere within two jumps. This gives Antares a lot of influence culturally as well as politically. It was because of these reasons that made Gulnara a sought-after prize during the Terran-Vasudan War, which eventually culminated to the victory for the GTA in the Battle of Gulnara in 2326.

The system is largely populated by Terran suppliers of the war effort with pockets of Vasudan inhabitants. Antares is one of the poorest systems currently occupied by the GTA, and there is an estimated 36 percent infant mortality rate. Antares also has a high crime rate, but the GTA's clamp down on Antares has been limited, instead focusing most of their efforts on more populated systems like Delta Serpentis.

Antares is known as the dark ally of the GTA because many in Antares believe that they owe no allegiance to the GTA unless they receive more economic support. The political atmosphere in Antares is extremely volatile. While a portion of the population of Antares does not want to secede, a growing voice promoting secession is causing a number of the political leaders to rethink their policies. "

1130, "(fr)Vasudans"

1131, "(fr)The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. The ceasefire  has begun to deconstruct these stereotypes.

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device is standard on all GTA and PVN communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other.

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War. There are no plans to change the naming convention as of yet."

1132, "(fr)The dark side of the Vasudan obsession with history was the emergence during the Great War of Hammer of Light (HoL), a cult that gained a strong following among the PVN, resulting in defections to the HoL cause. The HoL believed the Shivans were the cosmic redeemers and destroyers predicted in obscure prophecies written thousands of years ago. Following the destruction of the Lucifer, the ideology and activities of Hammer of Light shifted.

While some followers committed ritual suicide, the military branch of the movement continued their armed opposition to the Vasudan government and its alliance with the Terrans. Though they continue to espouse HoL's religious dogma, their activities turned more toward acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare. The HoL is a serious problem in systems without a strong government presence.

The PVN continues to cooperate with the GTA to bring the HoL to justice. Long-term plans for a joint Terran-Vasudan endeavor to eliminate the HoL have been mentioned since the eradication of the Shivans. "

1133, "(fr)Antares Federation"

1134, "(fr)The Antares Federation (AF) is a disorganized populist group that promotes sovereignty for the Antares system. It is an offshoot of the Antares for Antaresian movement (AfA), and it is proving to be more successful than its predecessor. While both want Antares to have some sovereignty, the Antares Federation movement wants Antares to secede from the GTA. Their idea of governance is derived from the first democratic nation in the late 18th century. They want to have a planetary and systemic government working side-by-side to solve the problems that currently plague Antares. This idea of democracy captures the imagination of those inhabiting the system and is the primary reason why thousands prefer the Antares Federation over the AfA movement. The AfA criticizes the AF for being overly zealous and militant, which is why the AfA are working with the GTA to prevent more casualties in the system.

Since the battle of Antares Station, the movement has been popularized by the media and the press. Citizens riots have risen dramatically, and protests are occurring every day. As a loose group with no known leadership, their attacks against the GTA have so far been ineffective, and the insurgents are being eliminated every day.

So far, the Antares Federation has bombed several GTA offices and poured oil on loyalists of the GTA. AF members attacking GTA suppliers also has been documented. The Antares Federation is considered a danger to the community, and all active members, supporters, and sympathizers are subject to arrests and fines if caught by the GTA."

1135, "(fr)Shivans"

1136, "(fr)Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and all research on live specimens ended with the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. The results of these studies remain highly classified.

According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. The most convincing evidence supporting this theory is the behavior of Shivan forces following the destruction of the Lucifer, the turning point of the Great War. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date."

1137, "(fr)Subspace"

1138, "(fr)In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

1139, "(fr)Ozymandias"

1140, "(fr)A skilled strategist and a deceitful terrorist, Ozymandias is a new face in the Hammer of Light and seemingly in charge of their Antares operations. No known history of Ozymandias appeared in any PVE records. His attack pattern is unpredictable but well-planned, and he has eluded capture several times. He commands the Typhon class destroyer Cardinal, but how he managed to capture the Cardinal remains to be discovered. Some have speculated that the PVN is using Ozymandias to weaken the GTA, but the Vasudan Parliament quickly dismisses such conspiracies, citing attacks on Vasudans as evidence of his rogue state. Ozymandias has been known to attack both military and civilian targets. Consider him a class A threat, and any other information regarding Ozymandias is to be reported directly to Terran Command. All other information about Ozymandias is classified."

1141, "(fr)Admiral Po"

1142, "(fr)Admiral Po is an unconventional but dedicated and loyal soldier of the GTA. Coming from a middle-class family, Po graduated from military academy at the top of his class. He witnessed the effects of crime and corruption in his home planet as a child, which he remarks as the primary reason for joining the GTA. Extremely reserved in front of his officers, Po has been known to go out on his own just to get things done. Despite not giving many speeches, the officers aboard the Intrepid have great trust in their admiral. As the commander of the Intrepid, Po has fought long and hard against the Vasudans and the Shivans, earning him medals and honors above others. 

Many pilots that serve under him have been transferred to elite fighter squadrons, and the famous 47th Cutthroats is stationed in the Intrepid. His tactics during both wars have earned him respect among his peers and reprimands from his superiors. Admiral Po was clamping down on drug cartels during peacetime until the Hammer of Light resurfaced."

Relatively unknown until now, Ehin worked for several political organizations before ending up in his current position. Since his first report in 2335 entitled 'War-Torn and Without Choice', Ehin has been a vocal critic of the Galactic Terran Alliance in the Antares system. His debut has made the populace suspicious of the GTA. He is frequently featured in other media because of his sensationalism and appeal to the extremists in Antares. He has recently supported the secessionist party in Antares, falsely claiming that other systems are doing so as well. His actions have stirred the radicals in Antares rally and protest in government offices. Dissidents in the sector have used his image to spread anti-GTA propaganda."
