MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I've got big news from the local feeds. The Motina Kometa crew just swore allegiance to Gadaria's Militia. They were the second largest Fringe group after the Malikans, and Gadaria's only remaining serious challengers." 5114 "14a-16"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "The Malikans now have almost uncontested ownership of deep Fringe space, and enough military hardware to challenge the Sulsian Navy." 5115 "14a-17"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "This is bad news. The only reason the Fringe groups hadn't overrun the Sulsian Navy before now is that they were competing with each other and disorganised enough to be suppressed piecemeal." 5116 "14a-18"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "With the Fringe groups organised under one leader, the Sulsian government has upgraded the threat level to Severe. I'll keep a close eye out for more updates over the next few days." 5117 "14a-19"

MSGXSTR "KAUR" 5118 "Hello Ross. Lau's sourced some new cannons for you and Meiks. I've modded them compatible with your gunships' systems." 5119 "14a-01"
MSGXSTR "KAUR" 5118 "You've got the option of Maxim cannons now. They're Federation standard and fire solid flechettes instead of explosive-tipped rounds." 5120 "14a-02"
MSGXSTR "KAUR" 5118 "They're a little better at subsystem and turret penetration than the Huaqings but they don't do as much damage against soft targets." 5121 "14a-03"
MSGXSTR "KAUR" 5118 "Like the Huaqing the Maxim pods are modular so it's a quick job to swap them out. Just let me know ahead of time before we jump out." 5122 "14a-04"
MSGXSTR "KAUR" 5118 "Personally I don't care for them as much as the Huaqings but Lau says I'm just biased." 5123 "14a-05"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Ross, Meiks. This is probably a bad idea but we're doing it anyway. We've picked up a distress call from the Sulsian warship Protogeneia." 5124 "14a-06"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "It looks like the Malikan militia's pulled off something big. They've ambushed the flagship of the Sulsian Navy, hit her reactor and left her adrift." 5125 "14a-07"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "The Malikan warship Opus is bombarding the Protogeneia from range. Her capabilities are unknown, but she's bigger than the corvettes we've come up against previously." 5126 "14a-08"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "The Hoshikuzu is the closest ship that can help. I'm bringing her in." 5127 "14a-09"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "We're going in without much info but here's the best plan I've got." 5128 "14a-10"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Undock from the Hoshikuzu and move to defend the Protogeneia from incoming missiles. The Hoshikuzu will move to take up a defensive position alongside the battlecruiser." 5129 "14a-11"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "We're going to try and buy time for the battlecruiser to restore power to her systems. The Opus is a lot bigger than we are and I don't plan to go near that ship." 5130 "14a-12"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "The Protogeneia is a pre-Great War relic, but she's all brute and muscle. We just need to cover her while she restores power to her engines and weapons for a counter-attack." 5131 "14a-13"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "I've been in contact with Latona waystation. Multiple Sulsian Navy ships are scrambling to assist, but none of them will arrive in time. We're likely be by ourselves during this engagement." 5132 "14a-14"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5088 "Everyone good? Ok. Let's go save some Sulsians." 5133 "14a-15"
