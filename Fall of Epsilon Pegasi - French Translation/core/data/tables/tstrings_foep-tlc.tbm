"

4554, "Epsilon Pegasi 2367
GTD Disciple
Welcome to Epsilon Pegasi

Admiral Wilson here. To all those pilots that have just joined us from the Laramis 10th Fleet - welcome! Your help in fighting off Bosch's Neo-Terran Front will be much appreciated, I am sure. While we've been unable to crack open Bosch's stronghold of Polaris, thankfully he hasn't yet breached our defences either.

Now that we have what looks like a Second Shivan Incursion on our hands, it's become all the more important that we hold our position in Epsilon Pegasi. With NTF rebels on one side and Shivans on the other, we can't afford to let ourselves become overrun by our enemies."

4555, "Manning the Gates

Recently, Bosch, through his right-hand Rear Admiral Koth, has stepped up attacks through the Polaris-Epsilon Pegasi jump node. Although he has yet to deploy any ship heavier than a cruiser, we suspect he is building up to a major assault.

Of concern are numerous remnants of fighter wings that have ran our blockade and now lurk in the rarely-frequented areas of Epsilon Pegasi. GTVA Command has reason to believe that Koth intends to use these fighters to disrupt Allied traffic and supply lines in this system. Patrols have been assigned and ship movement limited - consult your squadron leader for further details."

4556, "Our Status

I won't lie to you - the reason why we've been loaned pilots from the Laramis 10th Fleet is because 6th Fleet is overstretched and overworked. Bosch's initial defection took a good number of 6th Fleet men away from us loyalists, and being right on the brunt of his wrath has not helped matters either. Worse still, supporting fleet assets from the Capellan 3rd have been redirected to the Shivan Nebula, so we're really feeling the burn right now.

However, it's not our job to moan and whine - it's our job to keep Bosch and Koth out of Epsilon Pegasi. Remember - making sure our home and the systems beyond it remain GTVA through and through is our goal, our sole directive. We can't fail here, not with everything else that's going on.

Remember that, pilots."

4557, "As you should already know, the $r NTF has a wide array of forces poised to strike against our position in $b Epsilon $b Pegasi, and it's only the loyalist remnants of $g 6th $g Fleet that are keeping them back. This, I think, is common knowledge, even amongst those who have just joined us from $b Laramis.

What you don't probably know are the details."

4558, "NTF"

4559, "The deployment of $g GTVA vessels in $b Epsilon $b Pegasi is centred around defending key points of strategic importance. While this leaves vast swathes of $b Epsilon $b Pegasi undefended and unpatrolled, this is not an issue - since we control the $b Pegasi-Polaris jump node and thus the $r NTF's only point of entry into this system.

Unfortunately for us, this control must be maintained with time and effort. Today, it is your time and your effort that shall be spent in defence of the $g GTVA."

4561, "Providence"

4562, "Alpha"

4563, "$f Alpha, you shall assist the $f GTC $f Hardship and the $f GTC $f Providence in blockading the $b Polaris jump node. Should $r NTF strike teams attempt to break the blockade and seize control of the node, you are to stop them. Retaining control of this node is necessary to us retaining control of $b Epsilon $b Pegasi, and through that control of the $r NTF insurgency."

4564, "You did not have authorisation to return to base, pilot. Your actions jeopardised the lives of those involved in this mission and the GTVA's objectives in this theatre. Desertion is grounds for a court martial, and you are confined to quarters pending your preliminary hearing. Until a military court decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance."

4565, "Do not depart until told to do so."

4566, "The loss of the Providence was the destruction of our blockade. Once the NTF discovered that the gates were open, Bosch's fleet quickly invaded Epsilon Pegasi and seized several positions of strategic importance. Right now, 6th Fleet is engaged in a brutal, bloody war for survival - and we have you to thank for it.

Due to your wing's lack of competence, you have all been discharged from active service. Dismissed, pilot."

4567, "Successfully defending the two cruisers from the bomber wings should not only ensure they both survive, but also that they have the weaponry to destroy the two NTF cruisers when they jump in. If necessary, abandon the Hardship in favour of the Providence."

4568, "Welcome back - from your first mission in Epsilon Pegasi, for some of you. The fighting at the node was fierce, but you and the blockade pulled through.

It is unfortunate that the NTCv Rook made it through into GTVA space - the largest NTF incursion in this system in a long time. We fear that it may link up with NTF fighters that are also working behind our lines and cause havoc with our supply lines.

Hence, 6th Fleet will immediately start sweeping the system for the Rook - although without diverting forces from defence of Epsilon Pegasi, of course."

4661, "Unfortunately, $b Epsilon $b Pegasi is a big place, and thanks to the $r NTF, $g 6th Fleet lacks the manpower to conduct a full search. The $h Rook could be in any number of places - however, far too many $g GTVA positions are vulnerable to attack for us to stand by and wait for the $h Rook to strike first."

4662, "Searches will be conducted by three-man fighter wings that shall follow computer-generated nav points in their patrolling of the system. Your wing, $f Alpha, has been assigned a stretch in a cluster of asteroids along the outer edge of $b Epsilon $b Pegasi."

If indeed you do discover the rebel corvette, reinforcements will be dispatched to your location in a timely manner.

4665, "Beacon"

We might have better luck if we assigned more ships to the operation, but that would leave our position completely undefended - not only in the case of a sudden NTF push through the Polaris node, but also what they could quickly destroy, were the defending ships not there to protect our assets.

Apparently, the $h Rook and escorting $r NTF fighters have attacked the station, boarding and capturing the science cruiser and destroying $g GTVA supplies. The attack has already been underway for ten minutes, so you launch immediately.

Engage and destroy all hostile fightercraft present, but avoid the $h Rook until we can deploy heavier firepower to the situation. Suit up and get to your fighters!"

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae."

4703, "Do not open fire on defenceless targets, pilot!"

4704, "Well done on saving the station from the NTF corvette. However, the Rook has evaded us yet again, fleeing into the uncharted depths of Epsilon Pegasi before heavy support could be gathered and deployed.

Even so, your actions today foiled the plans of the NTF operatives. Their attack on the supply depot had two goals - first, the destruction of GTVA assets, which was mostly unsuccessful, but also the confiscation of GTVA supplies.

While the survivors aboard the Jackson have reported that the boarding party escaped with several useful supplies, and that a handful of dormant fightercraft were reactivated by NTF agents, the majority of the captured fighters attempted to wait you out - planning to depart once you returned to base. When the boarding team broke, they all lost their bottle.

The Rook is still out there somewhere, and the need to find it before it does any more damage is mounting. Aside from the Jackson station, the corvette has also attacked a civilian trade convoy, a wing of GTVA troop transports, and two separate cruiser patrols. That ship must be stopped, or we'll collapse from the internal pressure."

Should you encounter the $h Rook, you will be capable of acting immediately. Disable the corvette before it can escape, then disarm it so that other ships searching for the $h Rook - which, combat-ready as they will be, should arrive quickly - will not be damaged by its beam cannons.

GTSC Jackson
The NTF Incursion

Welcome to everyone who made it here to the Jackson. I'm Captain Peters, commanding officer of the GTC Providence and the highest-ranking officer present. Our rallying call was heeded by several other ships in this area of Epsilon Pegasi - unfortunately, the turnout has been less than satisfactory.

The Providence remains the heaviest ship present in our little fleet, and many of our vessels are civilian non-combatants - freighters and transports that are not suited for combat - who must be protected from vindictive NTF attack wings and invading cruisers."

4865, "Koth's Invasion

Yesterday, Rear Admiral Koth launched a massive invasion of the Epsilon Pegasi system. Our own forces, preoccupied with searching for the NTCv Rook - a corvette that had slipped past our lines a couple of days before - provided little to no resistance whatsoever, as Koth seized points of strategic worth without opposition.

We are cut off from outside help - not only from our supplies and repair crews, but also from the rest of the GTVA and even the remainder of 6th Fleet. Not knowing their location has rendered us unable to contact them directly, and the NTF appears to have either captured or destroyed the Pegasi Communications Terminal - meaning that we cannot contact superior officers through there, either."

4866, "A Way Out

We cannot fight a war against Koth's fleet without significant backup - to be precise, the GTD Disciple. Hence, our priority is to re-establish communications with either Admiral Wilson or GTVA Command, whichever is closer. Once we have done that, we can turn our attention to turfing Bosch's traitors off our land and out of our system.

Who knows? If we take Koth down now, that might just be the victory we need to push into Polaris and end this rebellion once and for all.

A couple of us officers have clubbed together and come up with something that might get us back in touch with the Disciple. Fighter pilots from the engagement with the Rook will help us in implementing this plan... the rest of us will just have to sit still a while."

4867, "Hello again, $f Alpha $f 1. We checked around and it appears that you're the longest-serving pilot present with us that has the greatest amount of combat experience, so we've decided to send you to link back up with $g Command.

I know it's asking a lot of you, but if we don't connect with the $f Disciple soon, we're done for. We need you, $f Alpha $f 1. Don't let us down."

4868, "Hippocampus Station"

4869, "Pegasus II"

4870, "$b Epsilon $b Pegasi is home to two installations of note - $f Enif $f Station and $f Hippocampus $f Station. We suspect that any other $g 6th $g Fleeters that haven't already been killed by the $r NTF will be gathered at one of these two installations.

$f Enif $f Station, regularly used by $g GTVA forces, will most likely be where the majority of the survivors are regrouping . However, that also means that Admiral Koth will probably have made it a priority target. The chances are that $f Enif $f Station will either have fallen or be the centre of such fighting as to make it unusable for our purposes.

$f Hippocampus $f Station, on the other hand, suffers from no such troubles."

4871, "$f Hippocampus $f Station is - was - primarily a civilian installation, although in recent times has been host to more and more $g GTVA soldiers, for obvious reasons. It is possible that there are $g Allied vessels stationed there right now, standing guard, ready to defend $f Hippocampus $f Station from Koth's ravening hordes.

As the smaller and less important of $b Pegasi's two stations, we believe that Koth will forsake the civilian $f Hippocampus in favour of the $g GTVA stronghold of $f Enif. Thus, it is to $f Hippocampus $f Station that we shall send you, $f Alpha $f 1, in order to contact the Admiral and arrange a rendezvous for our forces - possibly at the installation itself."

4872, "Obviously, we're not stupid. While $f Hippocampus $f Station may not be Koth's priority, he will have deployed troops to secure it. Should the $r NTF be laying siege to the installation, you will have to cross the battlefield by medium of stealth. A single fighter lacks the durability to survive the prolonged fire breaking through a blockade will require, and we can't risk civilian lives in this, which using our heavier vessels would entail.

Hence, you are to fly a $b Loki, which, despite its failings, still has a very difficult-to-detect signature and should escape the notice of the $r NTF ships without too many problems. Remain at a distance from any patrolling hostile ships - say, 600 metres - and you should make it through alive."

4873, "Once you arrive at $f Hippocampus $f Station, you'll need to open communications with the $f Disciple. Inform Admiral Wilson or the appropriate authorities of our location and status, and hopefully we can get a dialogue going.

Don't worry, pilot. We'll be back with the Admiral and the rest of $g 6th $g Fleet in no time, and Koth and his $r NTF will be out of $b Epsilon $b Pegasi shortly after that."

4874, "Disciple"

4875, "Your abandonment of this mission astounds me, pilot. You knew that we desperately needed to re-establish contact with GTVA Command, and although the destruction of Hippocampus Station changed the situation somewhat, nevertheless you failed to complete the mission objectives.

Since you seem unable to cope under the pressure of current circumstances, you will not be assigned missions of importance in the future. And should we link back up with the Admiral, your conduct will be reported in full - although our chances are slimmer than ever, thanks to you.

Dismissed."

4876, "Your incompetence might just have cost us all our lives, pilot. When you alerted the NTF to your presence, you not only stopped us from contacting Command, you also brought our existence to their attention. They are now aware of a group of GTVA craft trapped behind their lines and, if intercepted radio traffic is to be believed, have already begun scouring the system, searching for our base of operations.

Suffice to say, pilot, that you screwed up big time."

4877, "Remain at least 600 metres from the patrolling fighters. Firing weapons or getting too close will negate the stealth enhancements on your Loki, and if you are discovered, then you will not be able to contact any of the survivors hiding in the derelicts."

4878, "Congratulations, pilot, and thank you. You did good out there.

Now that we know where the Disciple is camping out, we can evacuate the station and all its guests to safety. Once the civilians are settled and the other military vessels rearmed and repaired, we can get to fighting Koth and the NTF. Vengeance for the Hippocampus will be extracted, that I can assure you.

Speaking more personally... I know it's tough when we have to leave civilians behind. There was nothing you could have done to help the survivors on board that derelict, not alone, in a single light interceptor, and it would not have been possible to deploy a rescue team to save them. As soon as we get back in touch with the Admiral, I'll recommend- I'll make sure that we dispatch someone to help those people and get them out, if they're still alive. We can but hope that nothing happens to them.

I'm going to need your help organising and controlling the evacuation of the Jackson in a few hours. It'll be a long and complicated process with a lot at stake and plenty that can go wrong. With someone of your calibre in the field, however, I'm sure it'll be just fine."

4919, "We were trying to get away when we got caught in the crossfire and lost engines. We shut down to hide from the patrols... anyway, we were trying to get to the Admiral's rallying point! He told us where to go if the NTF attacked us... somewhere on the edge of Pegasi, I think."

4925, "Right, right... very good, captain. We're hiding out around the orbit of Pegasus Sextus - probably best if you get over here as quickly as possible. We've got to figure out a way to take this system back from the NTF. Admiral out."

GTD Disciple
Reunification

Welcome back to the Disciple, pilots. You did well to get back to us alive after the NTF cut us off from one another. Many 6th Fleet ships have yet to report in and may have been destroyed.

As has become painfully clear to us, the Rook was never a real threat. It was intended to be a distraction, causing us to turn our attention away from the Polaris jump node and opening us up to attack from Koth, who was waiting for such an opportunity all the while. We should have anticipated this... but what's done is done."

5000, "Koth's Return

Koth, leading the charge on the NTD Repulse, has taken much of Epsilon Pegasi - the vast majority of the system is in NTF control. Isolated pockets of GTVA loyalists remain, but they are separated from reinforcements and supplies by hostile forces. Epsilon Pegasi is effectively an NTF system.

Our only piece of good news is the fact that Koth has halted his advance at two-thirds of the system, presumably hoping to consolidate his position before going on to take the rest of Epsilon Pegasi. His stopping short of the two remaining bastions of the Alliance - Enif Station and ourselves around Pegasus Sextus - give us hope that Koth might just be pushed back into Polaris, and perhaps then the NTF can be crushed entirely."

5001, "Our Objective

Enif Station has almost certainly dispatched somebody to inform the Alliance of our situation, and ideally reinforcements should arrive very soon indeed. Thus, our objective is to give those reinforcements all the help they can get by preventing Koth from conquering Epsilon Pegasi completely. If even the smallest piece of Pegasi can remain loyal to the Alliance, then that could give the GTVA the springboard from which it can launch a successful counterattack."

5002, "In order to prevent Koth from expanding $r NTF territory into the rest of $b Epsilon $b Pegasi, and thus deliver the system into Bosch's hands, we have devised a plan of action that should force Koth to pull his forces back and reassess the situation. Hopefully this delay will give the $g GTVA the advantage it needs to retake $b Pegasi."

5003, "Koth's Fleet"

5004, "The Admiral hopes to force Koth back by attacking his supply lines. Should the flow of fuel, soldiers and parts from $b Polaris to the front lines be disrupted, Koth would have no choice but to call his forces back until he could re-establish ties with the $r NTF home systems. $f Enif $f Station and the $f Disciple would be safe from Koth's attention for a few days, which might just be all that the $g Alliance needs.

All available fighter pilots are being given targets across the system. Your wing will attack the $h NTC $h Byrne's cargo depot."

5005, "Byrne"

5006, "The $h Byrne is a $b Leviathan cruiser that protects two cruisers and an assortment of cargo containers. Although the $h Byrne is a valid target and its destruction would be advantageous, it is not the objective of this mission.

Instead, you will focus your attention on the freighters and transports that use the depot as a refueling and drop-off point. By destroying these vessels, you will make it harder for Koth to resupply his armada and thus aid the $g GTVA immeasurably.

We shall be monitoring your progress and inform you when you are to return to the $f Disciple."

5007, "Freighters"

5008, "Transports"

5009, "Good work out there. Other wings have conducted similarly successful operations across NTF-held areas of Epsilon Pegasi, and Koth's supply lines have been well and truly cut.

Hopefully, we should see a temporary cessation of attack as Koth draws his unsupplied cruisers and corvettes back from the front lines. Without the necessary freighters and depots keeping up the flow of supplies to his forces, Koth will no longer be able to continue his advance."

5010, "While you accomplished your primary objective of destroying the NTF freighters and transports, you also managed to clean out the Byrne supply depot. Every blow we strike against the NTF only increases our chances of survival."

5011, "Particularly impressive was your destruction of the Byrne. A Leviathan cruiser is a formidable target, but you took it out regardless of the risk to yourself. Commendable, pilot."

5012, "You also ensured that not one freighter escaped your attack. Your attention to detail is a remarkable trait and has been noted."

5013, "However, we must bear in mind our situation. Koth's war machine is fully active and we've barely put a dent in it with our recent operations. Despite everyone working to the best of their ability, the NTF remain firmly in control of Epsilon Pegasi. Our concern must be the protection of civilians, not the defeat of Bosch's rebel army.

Our position will be re-evaluated tomorrow morning, and we shall act accordingly. You will be briefed once a plan of action has been ascertained. Until then, dismissed."

Despite the lack of reinforcement from $b Polaris, the rebel forces in $b Epsilon $b Pegasi are still on the offensive, with Koth's command ship, the $h NTD $h Repulse, leading the charge. Although the other $r NTF ships are reduced in effectiveness by our severing of their supply lines, the $b Orion destroyer remains a potent foe.

Strategic predictions indicate that if we do not take stronger action immediately, Koth will be be in a position to take and hold $f Enif $f Station, and if he does that, then the $g GTVA will find it much harder to re-enter $b Pegasi and steal it back from the $r NTF. We can't let that happen."

5071, "Our only course of action is to eliminate the problem at the source - that is, destroy the $h Repulse and kill Rear Admiral Koth. It's a risky plan, but we don't really have a choice in the matter.

$f Alpha wing will be deployed first. With assistance, they will 'soften up' the $h Repulse, targeting key subsystems and weapons platforms."

5072, "The $f Disciple will then jump in. Only the fleet flagship has the firepower necessary to truly engage and destroy both the $h Repulse and any ships that may attempt to rescue it. $f Alpha will assist in the destruction of the $h Repulse, before following the $f Disciple back to $b Pegasus $b Sextus to await the arrival of $g Allied forces.

The $g GTVA will arrive any moment now. We just have to hang on long enough for them to reach us. It won't take much to achieve, but it'll be the difference between us coming home alive and coming home in a bag."

5073, "Welcome back, pilot. Well done for surviving Koth's ambush... a shame that the Disciple didn't.

Unfortunately, without the Disciple, we're pretty much doomed. Aside from the fact that there's no way we can get you out of your fighter without the Disciple's fighterbay, without the power of the destroyer we have no chance of surviving the imminent NTF onslaught. You, the civilians and we officers are all going to die, because Koth will run roughshod all over us without the Disciple to protect us.

It's been a pleasure serving with you, pilot."

5074, "If you can't destroy the cruisers in time, pull back and defend the Disciple from the bombers and beam turrets before attacking the NTF cruisers again."

5075, "Congratulations, pilot, for getting out of that ambush alive. Ultimately, Koth proved too wily an opponent for us, and his summoning of the Normandy prevented us from completing our mission.

The Disciple has taken damage and its combat capability has been severely reduced. Critical hull breaches have made certain vital systems inoperable - that means the Disciple is no longer in any condition to fight.

Crew inspections have revealed the same thing for the other loyalists gathered here around Cygnus Sextus. The effort required from non-stop fighting and retreat from the NTF has taken its toll and the majority of pilots and officers are simply too tired to fight any more. Hence the Admiral's decision - to wait for relief from the GTVA. It's been sixteen hours since Koth's attack... help should be on the way right now.

However, the NTF'll be looking for us, so be prepared to be called up for combat at any moment."

Good luck, pilot."

5126, "Welcome to the Aquitane, pilot. Admiral Petrarch has been kind enough to house 6th Fleet survivors while the Disciple heads to Vega for repairs. He's very generously allowed me to be the one to debrief you on recent events in Epsilon Pegasi.

Rear Admiral Koth is dead. A recent push by the Capellan 3rd Fleet has retaken Epsilon Pegasi from the NTF completely. Koth fell on the bridge of the Repulse, defying the authority of the Alliance to the end. Even now, the GTVA Colossus is leading the charge into the heart of the Neo-Terran Front.

The Colossus is a new class of ship that was comissioned by Emperor Khonsu and the GTVA Security Council many years ago and was only finished recently. A massive juggernaught many times the size of a standard destroyer, the Colossus is armed to the teeth with the latest weapons and technology.
