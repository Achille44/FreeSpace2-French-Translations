4681, "La Grande Guerre"

4682, "En 2335, la guerre Vasudo-Terrienne entrait dans sa quatorzième année. L'Alliance Galactique Terrienne (GTA) et la Marine Parlementaire Vasudienne (PVN) étaient toutes deux épuisées, démoralisées et au bord de l'effondrement interne.

L'invasion d'une espèce mystérieuse, désignée sous le nom de Shiviens, contraint les dirigeants terriens et vasudiens à signer un armistice et à former une nouvelle alliance. Utilisant un armement et des boucliers avancés, les Shiviens attaquèrent sans provocation et sans avertissement.

Les alliés acquirent et développèrent de nouvelles technologies pour faire face à la menace. À l'avant-garde de l'armada shivienne se trouvait le SD Lucifer, un superdestroyer massif. Le Lucifer extermina toute vie sur Vasuda Prime et mit le cap sur la Terre. Aucune arme de l'arsenal allié ne pouvait pénétrer les boucliers du Lucifer.

Dans le système Altaïr, les scientifiques vasudiens découvrirent les ruines d'une civilisation éteinte détruite par les Shiviens il y a huit mille ans. Les artéfacts expliquaient comment suivre le Lucifer dans le sous-espace où ses boucliers ne fonctionneraient pas. Dans le sous-espace, le Lucifer pouvait être détruit.

Depuis le système Delta Serpentis, un escadron lancé depuis le GTD Bastion poursuivit le Lucifer jusqu'au nœud de saut de Sol. Ces chasseurs et bombardiers devaient détruire les réacteurs du Lucifer avant que le superdestroyer ne réduise à néant toute vie sur Terre.

De toute évidence, la mission réussit. Cependant, l'explosion du Lucifer créa un cataclysme subspatial qui fit s'effondrer le nœud de saut de Sol, coupant tout contact entre la Terre et les autres systèmes de l'espace vasudo-terrien."

4683, "Sous-espace"

4684, "En termes simples, le sous-espace est un tunnel à n dimensions entre un point de l'univers et un autre. Un vaisseau peut traverser ce tunnel en quelques minutes, effectuant un voyage qui pourrait autrement prendre des décennies, voire des siècles, à la vitesse de la lumière.

Un propulseur de saut fait vibrer un vaisseau dans plusieurs dimensions jusqu'à ce que ses modulations soient en parfaite synchronisation avec le continuum subspatial. Un vortex s'ouvre, créant une ouverture à partir d'un point infiniment petit du cosmos, permettant au vaisseau de franchir le seuil subspatial.

Deux types de sauts sont possibles.

Le premier, un saut intrasystème, peut se produire entre deux points d'un système stellaire. La plupart des petits vaisseaux spatiaux sont équipés de propulseurs capables de réaliser ces courts sauts. La présence d'un champ gravitationnel intense est requise, interdisant tout voyage au-delà des limites d'un système stellaire.

Ensuite, les vaisseaux peuvent sauter de système en système via des nœuds. Jusqu'à la Grande Guerre, seuls les grands vaisseaux pouvaient générer suffisamment de puissance pour utiliser les nœuds de saut. Le développement de propulseurs de saut pour chasseurs et bombardiers en 2335 a permis à l'Alliance de détruire le SD Lucifer dans le sous-espace. La production de ces petits propulseurs de saut étant d'un cout prohibitif, ils sont limités aux missions qui nécessitent que les pilotes voyagent entre deux systèmes. L'Affichage Tête Haute indique l'emplacement des nœuds de saut par une sphère verte.

La grande majorité des nœuds subspatiaux sont extrêmement instables, se formant et se dissipant en quelques nanosecondes. D'autres nœuds ont une durée de vie plus longue, existant pendant des siècles ou des millénaires avant de s'effondrer. Les nœuds de saut approuvés par la GTVA pour les voyages interstellaires devraient rester stables pendant de nombreuses années."

4685, "Shiviens"

4686, "Malgré les informations que nous avons pu obtenir, les Shiviens restent, à bien des égards, une énigme pour les Terriens et les Vasudiens. Leur origine et leur destination restent inconnues. Bien que de nombreuses personnes aient proposé des explications possibles sur la raison pour laquelle les Shiviens semblent se concentrer sur la destruction de toutes les autres espèces sensibles, nous ne savons toujours pas pourquoi ils semblent vouloir un xénocide total.

Les Shiviens ont plusieurs yeux, dont certains semblent avoir la fonction d'yeux composés, un peu comme certaines variétés d'insectes. Les shiviens ont également cinq pattes, et peuvent courir aussi bien sur le sol qu'au plafond. On a émis l'hypothèse que les Shiviens ont pu évoluer dans un environnement sans gravité. Chaque jambe shivienne se termine par une griffe très puissante, capable d'écraser les alliages connus les plus robustes. Certaines parties de leur thorax semblent agir comme des compartiments, tels que ceux que l'on pourrait trouver sur une combinaison spatiale. Il a été suggéré que ce que nous avons réellement vu était soit des robots, soit des créatures organiques dans une sorte d'exo-squelette. Cependant, nous n'avons, à l'heure actuelle, aucune raison de soutenir l'une ou l'autre de ces hypothèses.

Il est fort probable que nous n'en saurons pas plus sur l'espèce shivienne tant que nous n'aurons pas capturé et étudié un Shivien."

La cadence de tir rapide et la masse élevée du Fléau en font une arme idéale pour modifier le vecteur de vitesse d'un chasseur ou d'un bombardier ennemi. Il est légèrement plus efficace que le Vengeur contre les boucliers, évalué en dégâts/seconde. Son faible taux de consommation d'énergie le rend utile pour les engagements prolongés.

Le Prométhée fonctionne mieux contre la coque des cibles. Contre les boucliers, il n'atteint que des performances médiocres.

The Aesacus is mainly deployed as an escort for larger warships and convoys, but the Earth Alliance has also occasionally deployed Aesacus-class cruisers to intercept fighter squadrons to devastating effect.

The Dikastes is the most unique of the Transjovian warships fielded by the Earth Alliance to date. The Dikastes is a sophisticated unit that specializes in long-range surgical strikes using its destroyer-grade spinal beam cannon. Our analysts believe that Dikastes is in fact, a Soter or Proxenos mainframe reworked to house a massive reactor directly linked with with beam cannon and unique stabilizer device. Displaying obvious similarities to Apothess-class destroyers, Dikastes seems to be a result of reverse-engineered vasudan technology scanned during Alliance's siege on the Ishtar installation utilizing GVD Sebek. It remains unknown for us how TransJovians managed to reproduce it so fast, and significantly decrase size of the whole device. Dikastes is an extremely dangerous threat to Alliance vessels. Capable of bristling all of her firepower from 11,5 clicks, a wing of Dikastes cruisers is capable of neutralizing a destroyer-grade targer as efficiently as infamous, opening salvo of Lindos class destroyers and remain beyond range of any potential backlash fire. Despite being armed in decent point defence screen, main drawback of Dikastes is her vulnerability to fighter and bomber strikes. Focusing device is extremely large and produce enormous amount of radiation, so all of the components had to be installed outside the ship. Additionally such large beam weapon needs to radiate all the heat directly into space making it's core systems exposed. Those features should be compensated by GTVA's strike units. Without her main beam Dikastes is a minimal threat, but TjD seems to be very protective about warships of this class, and often deploying multiple wings of fighters to protect Dikastes class warships. Very few examples were ever encountered. This fact lead our analysts to conclusion, that Dikastes is a prototype warship deployed in limited numbers to evaluate both the ship and subspace focusing technology for beam weaponry. "

During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper-hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of a fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and promptly dismissed.

The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Just over fifty years ago, the SD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN fleet that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work.

With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began.

The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over thirty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed.

Although the central section is the same in every example of this class, the Cepheus comes in many different variants due to various types of extensions designed to expand already impressive utility of Cepheus. EA heavily fortified their premier installation. Armament varies from station to station, but all of them have thick point defence screen consisted of gattling turrets, EMP charge drivers and swarm missiles. Majority of Cepheus installations are equipped in railgun weaponry, and some even utilize beam cannons. Those stations are always heavily guarded.

Although the Assault Skjoldr retains the paired, rotating light Fusion Mortar turrets of the normal gunship, its offensive anti-ship are augmented by a magazine of forty antiship missiles feeding eight independent torpedo launchers. Although limited in endurance thanks to its relatively small magazine, and completely reliant on friendly fighters or escorting capital ships to provide anti-fighter cover, the Assault Skjoldr is capable of delivering a great deal of damage."

5546, "(fr)GTGs Skjoldr"

5547, "(fr)The Skjoldr Gunship was originally deployed only twelve months before the commencement of hostilities with the Vasudans. Equipped with a pair of rotating light Fusion mortar turrets, its anti-ship damage output is comparable to that the main weapon of a Fenris cruiser, although its considerably smaller magazine means that, in ship to ship combat, its endurance may be an issue. However, though equipped to tackle Vasudan capital ships, the primary mission of the Skjoldr is anti-fighter. Its port and starboard batteries of heat seeking missiles are optimised to engage small strikecraft, both in defence of larger vessels and in offensive roles.  Production of a modified version of the original Skjoldr Gunship has been resumed on Mars.  It can be assumed that it will have found its way into the hands of other governments hostile to the GTA."

Although the Majesty was the first, and thus gave its name to the new subclass of destroyer, it would not be the last - even before the formal announcement of the Jovian Coalition of its new toy, it was suspected by many that not only had the Jovians begun work on other destroyers, but also the various other powers had started building their own new destroyers as well.

Worryingly for the GTA, the Majesty marked the change in the rebel powers from 'civilian uprising' to actual independent governments on par with, if not superior to, the Alliance."

When the destruction of the Lucifer in the Great War caused the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node to collapse, the GTA had several Orion class destroyers in Sol ready to fight the Shivan superdestroyer to the bitter end. Rather than scrap these ships as newer models were built, the Earth Alliance modified the destroyers, fitting them with a second hangar bay to increase their fighter capacity, and replacing the traditional hull armor with the EA's heavier plating. We can also conclude that the EA built a number new ships of this class from scratch, as nine units of this type have been identified in battle so far. As a fleet carrier, the Auriga can carry over 180 combat spacecraft while mounting a number of medium beam and railguns to fend off cruiser and corvette attacks."

5639, "(fr)In the earliest days of interstellar travel, trade between systems was relatively limited by the simple expense of access, both to orbital and super-orbital space and to intersystem jump technology. As technology matured, however, and access to space became cheaper, commercial activity and interstellar trade grew rapidly, particularly as colonisation efforts – and later the 14 Year War – saw demand boom. Soon, the requirements of the ballooning trade network threatened to overwhelm the early Endymion class space stations of the time.

The Alliance’s response was two-fold. The first was the acceleration of the design and deployment of the earliest Arcadia class Installations in order to reduce the burden on existing Endymions in the largest populated system. The second was the development of the Veles, a smaller station and supply depot that could serve in a number of roles as a resupply depot, cargo or passenger transfer station or deep space storage facility in populated systems. Some were further adapted to provide refuelling capabilities or for maintenance and repair of the vessels they serviced.

Unlike the larger, more generalist Arcadia, the Veles demonstrates an almost spartan dedication to its role. Where an Arcadia can accommodate thousands, a Veles has an active crew of only a few hundred, and a maximum capacity of under a thousand people. Where an Arcadia has a cavernous fighterbay and was armed to defend itself during wartime, the Veles was very lightly armed (or in many cases entirely unarmed) and used its various landing bays primarily for shuttles, transports and small freighters rather than fighters. Despite these apparent shortcomings, the Veles was considered highly successful in its role, and the simple, robust design rapidly spread across Sol and the newly colonised systems of the GTA."

"

5722, "(fr)The Lucifer evaded the Bastion in Sirius and is now in Delta Serpentis. In a matter of moments it will make the jump to Sol. The Bastion will attempt to close with and follow the Lucifer into subspace... but it's not looking good. The chances of losing Sol are getting bigger and bigger."

5723, "(fr)The various colonies are being evacuated as we speak. Wings of transports are being loaded with passengers and awaiting the order to scatter. When the Lucifer arrives, those transports will make a run for the Delta Serpentis node and for safety. This way, some lives will be saved.

But the evacuation isn't over yet, and there are still a lot of people down there on that blue planet of ours. And as pilots for the Galactic Terran Alliance's 1st Fleet, the finest and greatest of them all, you will do everything in your power to buy enough time to evacuate each and every one of those civilians."

5724, "(fr)Attacking the Lucifer is a suicide mission. Which is why every single one of you will die to a man to delay that superdestroyer for as long as possible. Do I make myself clear?

Let's just hope the Bastion comes through this time."

5725, "(fr)The $g GTD $g Terra and the rest of $g 1st $g Fleet have positioned themselves nearby the $b Delta $b Serpentis jump node. When the $r Lucifer jumps in, $g 1st $g Fleet will move to engage it. You will guard $g 1st $g Fleet during that battle."

5735, "(fr)It's good to see you back alive, pilots. I didn't think I'd be seeing any of you again - I didn't think I'd be seeing anything, period.

The SD Lucifer has been destroyed. Although the Bastion didn't make it into the node in time, a strike force made up of the destroyer's crack pilots managed to catch up with the Lucifer and destroy its five reactors. Those pilots are receiving a hero's welcome on Earth as we speak.

However, the destruction of the Lucifer in subspace had some... adverse effects on the node. Attempts to send news of the Bastion's task force's success mysteriously failed. Investigation into this revealed the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node to have completely collapsed.

Sol has been cut off from the rest of the Galactic Terran Alliance.

The news will be released to the general public tomorrow. Until then, keep your mouths shut. And to aid you all in this, all GTA personnel are forbidden to fraternise with civilians until the news has been broken.

5826, "(fr)You will be deployed to $g Luna $g Station, one of our oldest $b Arcadia installations, in orbit around the $b Moon. Fear and panic are spreading amongst the ore miners there like wildfire, so we're sending in the $g GTT $g Peacemaker, complete with specialised public-relations personnel to calm them down.

5832, "(fr)This operation very nearly went horribly wrong, pilot, but thanks to you, the day was saved.

5837, "(fr)However, Luna Station is back in the hands of the Galactic Terran Alliance, thanks to you. Job well done, pilot.

We've also had success across the rest of the system. Civil discontent appears to have quietened down for now, but all GTA staff are to remain on standby in case it erupts again, and suddenly. You never can tell with civilians."

5838, "(fr)Your failure to protect the Talos means that Luna Station still resides in the hands of terrorists. This 'victory' has inspired the rest of the Sol system to rioting and open rebellion, which has lead to some very brutal putdowns by GTA forces. This is possibly the beginning of a Sol civil war.

However, you won't be around to see it. Following your failure here, you have been grounded and stripped of your wings. Don't expect to even see a fighter again, civilian."

5934, "(fr)Not one single freighter made it out of that engagement alive. While you were surprised by enemy forces larger than you were capable of dealing with, a failure of this magnitude cannot go unpunished. They need somebody to pin this on, and that person is you, pilot.

You've been demoted and reassigned to flying logistical support for 1st Fleet. You won't be seeing any action for a long time yet, pilot. Congratulations are in order, I suppose."

However, we have other, bigger problems. The interference of the Crown, the Typhoon and the Cirrus - all civilian craft - in a military operation, and actually firing on military craft... GTA Command believes that we are looking at a full blown rebellion here. If this is true, and the planets are shrugging off the Alliance and acting independently... then the Great War will be nothing compared to the carnage we shall soon see."

5937, "(fr)Still, one good piece of news - you managed to save every single freighter under attack. When things go wrong, pilot, it can be difficult to save the situation and prevent things from getting worse. Thanks to you, though, Lambda, Kappa and Iota wings all made it out alive. Excellent flying there, pilot."

5938, "(fr)You managed to save the majority of those freighters, pilot. Without sufficient backup and no reinforcements, you still ensured that most of those freighters got back to Earth, where they'll be put to good use. We need all the ships we can get, and also keep morale up as high as we can. Good work."

5939, "(fr)Most of the convoy you were charged with protecting didn't make it, pilot. Don't beat yourself up over it, though. You were vastly outnumbered - six fighters against two cruisers and over eight wings - and it's a wonder that you managed to save anyone at all. As it is, you did good to get somebody out alive."

5940, "(fr)Although not strictly necessary, it would have been nice if more freighters had survived. Leo bombers are your major threat. Take out their bombs, but remember they'll relaunch them if their initial bombs are shot down and they can get in close. Also, don't forget about Pisces wing."

6027, "(fr)As you may all have already heard, the evacuation of the science colony orbiting Neptune was aborted after strike craft engaged our forces. Shortly afterwards, the Jovian colony declared itself independent of the GTA and renounced the treaties and agreements that bound it to the Galactic Terran Alliance.

The 'Jovian Coalition' are to be considered traitors by all GTA personnel, but also a military force to be reckoned with. These aren't just a bunch of pirates - the Jovian colony, like all the others, maintained a separate fleet once. It's only a matter of time before they build it up again."

6028, "(fr)It is believed that several of the other planets are on the verge of open rebellion as well. One other power has been sighted - the Uranian-Neptunian Union - but nobody apart from the Jovians have declared their independence.

This rebellion must be crushed swiftly, pilots. The GTA cannot be allowed to collapse. Order throughout Sol must be maintained. As the only remnants of the GTA known to still exist, we must preserve the Alliance at all costs."

6029, "(fr)The GTW-15B Avenger Mark II cannon is now available for deployment. This version uses photon acceleration technology to achieve the same effect - a good light cannon that is equally effective against shields and hull plating.  As this weapon was planned for production throughout the Solar system it is likely that our enemies may make use of these new weapons as well."

6030, "(fr)Alright, it's true, I know. $r Jupiter has officially gone rogue, and I think that unless we put this little revolution down quickly, the rest of the system is going to follow suit. So put away your shocked expressions, forget all those whispered rumours you've heard - we've got to get down to business."

6031, "Jupiter"

6032, "(fr)The $g GTA is launching several simultaneous attacks on $r Jovian outposts in and around $b Jupiter's moons. Your wing, $g Alpha $g 1, will attack the $r JTR $r Argus, a $r Jovian rearming and refueling centre. Beta Wing of Apollo fighters will cover you. You will destroy that ship along with the cruisers and other ships rearming there. One of those cruisers will be the $r JCC $r Crown, who interfered in our last operation. Take the opportunity to extract some vengeance on behalf of the $g GTA."

6036, "(fr)Once the outpost has been destroyed, you will remain behind to attack any reinforcements that come to the outpost's aid. $g Command will inform you when you may depart.

You may choose from either $b Medusa or $b Ursa bombers for your loadout. We recommend the $b Medusa, as it is more maneuverable than the $b Ursa and more capable of dogfighting. Due to the multi-pronged simultaneous attacks occurring as part of this operation, we can spare only one escort wing of Apollo fighters to cover you."

6037, "Renforts"

6038, "(fr)Good job taking out that rearming station. One wing against several cruisers and gunboats would normally be suicide, but excellent GTA training and equipment won out over the rag-tag rebels.

Command reports similar successes across the theatre of operations - similar in that although objectives were accomplished, our strikes revealed a far stronger Jovian fleet than we suspected. Despite our many strikes against them, the Jovians still outnumber us greatly, and we haven't even started on the other planets yet.

1st Fleet is getting ready to deal the deathblow to the Jovians near Mars, and your next operation will be escorting the Terra to Jupiter so it can put down these rebels once and for all."

6092, "(fr)This engagement was a disaster, pilot. 1st Fleet was massacred by the Martian surprise attack. Although the Terra managed to escape, our entire detachment of cruisers was destroyed. Only a handful of cruisers remain, and they are tied up with important defence assignments. Our offensive power - hell, our defensive as well - has effectively been neutered.

One destroyer cannot stand against a fleet. Thanks to your gross incompetence today, the very security of the Galactic Terran Alliance has been compromised. So, you are hereby discharged from service, to prevent you from doing any further damage. Dismissed."

6093, "(fr)Ignore everything else - just get those bombers. Leo and Virgo target the Szczerbiec and the Praxiteles first, so get to them first and shoot those bombs down."

6094, "(fr)This engagement was a complete disaster, pilot. The Martian surprise attack put paid to any ideas about assaulting Jupiter. We evidently have problems a lot closer to home than we first thought.

The attack on Jupiter has been postponed indefinitely. GTA Command has given all GTA forces a new objective that supersedes our old one - instead of securing the Sol system, we must retake the inner colonies. Mars, along with Venus and Mercury, must be fully under GTA control before we can even think of taking on the Jovian Coalition again."

6095, "(fr)That said, this will prove to be difficult to accomplish with the loss of the majority of our fleet. Over half of the Terra's cruiser escort was destroyed by the Martians. Thankfully we held back a handful of cruisers for defence purposes, but the vast majority of 1st Fleet was destroyed today. With only a destroyer and a few cruisers standing against several rebel fleets, things look grim indeed."

6150, "(fr)A Jovian strike force managed to disable the Terra as it was fleeing from Martian space. Soldiers managed to board the destroyer and capture her.

This is terrible news. Not only have we lost our flagship, our only advantage over the rebels, but also our enemies have gained a powerful vessel. The rebels will march on Earth soon, and the sad thing is, the Terra will lead the charge."

6151, "(fr)Destroy Libra wing before they can dock. Better yet, don't let the Terra be disabled at all."

6152, "(fr)Good job protecting the Terra. Things got pretty intense out there, but you kept the situation under control. Good work.

The Jovian attack is rather disconcerting. It indicates a level of strategic thinking in the Jovian Coalition that surpasses our initial estimates. They are certainly better thinkers than the Martians, who simply wanted to destroy the Terra. All this is a moot point, however, thanks to your timely intervention in their little scheme.

Conversely, the actual opening of fire between Martian and Jovian forces shows that the rebels are not unified in their efforts. This could be extremely useful to us - not only will the rebel fleets' efforts be hindered by their rivals, but also these divides can be exploited by us to ensure our survival."

6153, "(fr)The Terra is well on the way back home and the pursuing Martian cruisers pulled off a while ago, so she should be safe. We'll get repairs done on her as soon as possible, but don't expect the Terra to be fully operational any time soon.

Good job, pilot. Losing the Terra would have been a blow the Alliance would not have been able to recover from. Thanks to you, she'll live to fight another day."

So far, we are up against the Mercurian Federation, the Venusian Syndicate, the Republic of Mars, the Jovian Coalition, the United Saturnian States, the Uranian-Neptunian Union, and the Independent Peoples of Pluto. We have a very complicated problem indeed."

Other attacks on the Venusian fleet have gone off without a hitch, leaving their navy in a sorry state of affairs. However, while we would normally push ahead with our advantage here and attack their HQ, reports from the Martian front have been somewhat discouraging. Facing both Martians and Jovians, our already paltry fleet is crumbling away under the pressure.

You're being sent to help shore up the Martian front. The Venusians have been effectively neutered, so we must concentrate our forces on Mars and prevent them from mustering their forces for an attack on Earth."

6228, "(fr)The destruction of the Benediction, an Arcadia class installation, could not have been an accident. There is simply no way that station could have been destroyed by anything other than your willfully and intentionally opening fire on it.

6288, "(fr)Good job in keeping the refinery complex clear of hostiles.  We've been able to send reinforcing elements to secure the area.  We had not anticipated such a strong Jovian presence.

It seems that their attack was more than a mere scouting operation, such as those done by Jovian ships previously sighted around Mars or just an attempt to destroy the facility. This was part of a full-scale invasion of Mars by Jupiter. Normally we would celebrate, seeing as it appears one rebel power has just destroyed another, but Command suspects that the Jovian objective was not simple conquest. You and the rest of 1st Fleet will be briefed on the situation more fully when more information becomes available.

In the meantime, Command has called off all offensive operations on both the Martian and Venusian fronts. For the moment, Command wants us to take a breather while we wait and see what's going on on Mars."

6374, "(fr)Today, the Republic of Mars and the Venusian Syndicate, under duress, signed peace treaties with the Jovian Coalition. Under orders from Jupiter, the Martian fleet is moving into position for a full-scale attack on Earth. We face several cruiser wings, numerous gunboats and multiple fighter and bomber squadrons.

Suffice to say, 1st Fleet must defend Earth. Against such overwhelming forces, our only comfort is that they have no destroyer to counter the Terra with. However, the Martians do probably have Harbinger bombs amongst their arsenal, which pose a credible threat to the destroyer."

6375, "(fr)The Alliance is nearly gone. We destroyed the Shivan Lucifer, discovered its weakness, followed it into subspace and destroyed the Destroyers. But in its death throes, it threw us a double vengeance - not only the destruction of the way out of Sol, trapping us here for all eternity, but also the fragmentation of our Alliance from within, the treachery of the greedy and power hungry.

Darkness blankets us. Only Earth and the lunar colonies remain loyal to us. We are all that stands between the Galactic Terran Alliance and domination by the Jovian Coalition. The Terra is our last beacon of hope. Ensure that it is not extinguished."

6376, "(fr)This is it. Our enemies converge on $g Earth just as the $r Shivans converged on $b Sol. This time, however, no ancient ruins are here to save us. Our lives, our freedom, must be fought for and won by ourselves, paid for with our own blood, toil and tears. We're going to have to fight our way out of this one."

6377, "Terre"

6378, "(fr)The remaining ships of $g 1st $g Fleet have assembled in orbit around $g Earth, but it's not a reassuring sight. All of our ships have taken damage in some way or form, and some are in critical shape. Our only real weapon is the $g Terra, and she won't stand against a prolonged assault by cruisers and bombers. Even so, she is our only hope."

6379, "(fr)Your orders, $g Alpha and $g Beta, are to ensure the $g Terra survives and that the attacking rebel fleet is destroyed. It's possible that if we can repel this assault, the rebels simply won't have the manpower to launch another attack, and some kind of peace treaty can be worked out.

Either way, if the $g Terra falls, $g Earth and the $g Alliance are done for."

6380, "Flotte Rebelle"

6381, "(fr)You abandoned the Terra during the final fight for Earth. You betrayed not only the thousands on board that destroyer, but also your wingmen, Earth, and everything the Galactic Terran Alliance stands for.

Or stood for. The Terra was destroyed by the rebel assault. Nothing remains of either 1st Fleet or the GTA, and now Earth is firmly under the thumb of the Jovians.

Normally for deserting the field of battle you would be punished. But with the end of the Galactic Terran Alliance and the imminent execution of all its former staff, I don't really think there's much point."

6382, "(fr)Excellent news, pilots, excellent news to match an excellent performance!

Your flying out there ensured our victory and the Terra's survival. If the Terra had gone down, we would have been wide open to attack and the rebels would have been able to just walk in and conquer Earth. But you and the rest of 1st Fleet prevailed and destroyed the attacking rebel fleet.

Speaking of which... the rebel fleet was a rag-tag flotilla of the remaining Martian and Venusian cruisers. Our fleet may have been all but wiped out, but so has theirs. GTA representatives will be meeting up to discuss an armistice with the various rebel governments. Crippled as we all are, none of us are able to continue the fight, and so peace is our only option left.

But you don't have to worry about politics. Just relax and head on down back to Earth. You saved the world and the Alliance. You're a hero now. We all are."

6383, "(fr)The Terra was destroyed by the rebel attack force. Without the flagship of 1st Fleet - our only serious weapon against the rebels - the Galactic Terran Alliance is at an end. Rebel forces have already made landings on Earth and are beginning their subjugation of our planet.

As former GTA staff, we are to be executed tomorrow morning for 'treason'. It was a pleasure serving with you all, pilots. It's a shame it has to end this way."

6470, "(fr)Pre-emptive Strike"

6471, "(fr)I would like to start today's command briefing by extending a warm welcome to all the new pilots that have just joined up with 1st Fleet today! For the past five years, we have been patrolling the area around Earth, ensuring its safety and protection from the rebel threat that flourishes in the rest of the Sol system. I myself have been fighting for the Alliance ever since Operation Thresher, back in the T-V War. Oh, my name's Admiral Johnson, for those of you who don't know already."

6472, "(fr)You all know our new leaders have been changing quite a few things around here, namely the scrapping of the GTD Terra and a few dramatic legislative reforms. However, Command has informed me that starting from today, 1st Fleet will be undergoing a massive overhaul, starting with the following..."

6473, "(fr)...namely, the GTD Tereus has finally been completed! Engineers have finished their tests and technicians are even now readying the new destroyer for combat.

For those of you who haven't been keeping up, the GTD Tereus is a brand new destroyer straight from the think-tanks of the GTA. Based on the old Orion design, the Tereus class boasts stronger weaponry and armour, and Command hopes that it will lead us to victory over the rebels!"

6474, "(fr)That said, our enemies have also not been idle in the time since or last conflict.  Our intelligence reveals that the Martian Republic have been constructing new  Skjoldr class gunships.  The Skjoldr was a small cruiser constructed by the GTA during the T-V war as a complement to the larger Fenris class.  The Martians have likely pressed the class back into service to rapidly grow their fleet strength.  We do not know in what way these ships have been armed or differ from their T-V war ancestors.  We are uncertain what types of fighters you may encounter, but be prepared for anything. "

6475, "(fr)Command has authorised us to go ahead with Operation Medusa's Gaze, a series of missions that should clear the air for us and will become the first combat deployment of the GTD Tereus. For those of you who have received messages about this upcoming operation, briefing will begin in fifteen minutes. The rest of you, it's business as usual. Dismissed."

6476, "(fr)Hello and welcome to $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze. You have been randomly selected to take part in the $g GTA's first offensive military operation in five years, ever since the near-annihilation of $g 1st $g Fleet and the signing of the $b GTA-Independents peace treaty in 2335."

6477, "(fr)A little background knowledge for you - the terms of the peace treaty confine all $g GTA craft to $g Earth and the area immediately around $g Earth. While the rebels have all of $b Sol to run around in, we are not allowed anywhere outside of the region between $r Mars and $r Venus, on pain of war once more."

6478, "(fr)To ensure that we kept our side of the bargain, $r Mars and $r Venus set up several border outposts to keep an eye on us. One such outpost, consisting of three Martian gunboats and a small cargo depot, will be the target of the first phase of $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze.  At least one of these vessels appears to be mounted with a powerful radar system."

6480, "(fr)RMGs Crimson"

6481, "(fr)You will be formed into two wings, $g Alpha and $g Beta. $g Alpha will cover $g Beta bombers while they destroy the outpost.  Ignore any threats of war the outpost makes. $g Command is well aware of the consequences this strike will have - be assured that we know what we are doing. Get to your ships, pilots, and destroy this outpost utterly. "

6482, "(fr)Welcome back, pilot. Your first engagement was a success. This is good to hear - from what I hear from Command, we'll be needing lots of successes if Operation Medusa's Gaze is going to work.

Speaking of which, Command hasn't bothered to inform me what significance the destruction of that outpost has, but that's nothing new. Get used to it, pilot.

Those strange Apollos you encountered seem to be a new class of Martian manufactured fighter.  We have provisionally designated these ships as $quoteGTF Latona$quote.  They appear to be superior to the old type, but their exact characteristics are unknown.

The Republic of Mars has understandably reacted with outrage at the mysterious disappearance of one of their monitoring outposts, but since there's nothing official to directly link the GTA to the raid, there's nothing they can do.

And before you ask, Command does know it is endangering the previous administration's peace treaty with the rebels. I don't know what they're up to, but it'll probably be for the best anyway."

6483, "(fr)It is unfortunate that you were unable to destroy the Martian freighters. While they were only civilians, they were traitors to the Alliance and deserved to die. Still, don't worry about it. You had other, more important things to worry about at the time.  At least it seems that they could not provide the Republic of Mars with hard evidence of our involvement, or that the Martian government is not willing to escalate our attack into full scale war just yet."

6484, "(fr)Make a beeline for the Chariot and Pisces wing. Remember that the Poseidon freighters will go down faster than the Chronos."

Unlike the Republic of Mars, who have not responded well to the destruction of another of their stations and one of their cruiser wings as well. Strangely enough, Command does not appear to be worried about the threats of war coming from Mars.

They have called off any further attacks against Martian forces, however. But if they think that'll be enough to prevent a war with Mars, then they're mistaken.

Both myself and Command want you to remain on standby, just in case. In the meantime, I don't want you discussing any aspect of Operation Medusa's Gaze, or what little you've seen of it, with anyone - civilian OR soldier. Got it?"

6553, "(fr)Oh, and by the way, good job protecting the Manna. While the Manna is technically worthless, your defence of it indicates a willingness to defend GTA property that I think ought to be rewarded and encouraged, in case of an operation where such an approach might just save the day.

6606, "(fr)The first phase of Operation Medusa's Gaze has gone off without a hitch, thanks to you, pilot. Operation Medusa's Gaze was an elaborate bait-and-switch trap centred around our new Tereus destroyer and our lack of a real fleet. Command is hoping to use the weapons of fear and panic against the Martians, to counter their vast numerical superiority, and we think that the annihilation of one of their cruiser wings by an unknown, nigh-on invincible ship using strange new ack-ack cannons should do the job admirably.

We're about to begin the push for Mars, and the second war the Sol system has seen in five years. You've seen the Tereus in action on her first combat deployment - now you will serve aboard her during her first campaign. Dismissed."

The Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity. This weapon was until recently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions, but has now been cleared for mass production. Use it well."

6643, "(fr)Before we launch an assault on $r Mars, we must take out some key secondary installations in order to weaken the $r Martian forces. Because of your skill and experience shown in $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze, you have been chosen to lead the strike against the second most important $r Martian installation - the $r Romulus and $r Rémus command centres."

6644, "(fr)The $r Romulus and $r Rémus are asteroids towed from the 'Belt to Mars orbit to serve as installations in the early days of space colonisation, initially for mining and for a platform in between $r Mars itself and the rest of $b Sol. Now, they serve in a military function as a second command centre for the $r Republic. The leaders of $r Mars will undoubtedly flee to $r Romulus and $r Rémus in case of their primary HQ being destroyed, so it is important we take out their bolthole before they have the opportunity to use it."

6648, "(fr)Mars' twin emergency command centres of Romulus and Rémus have been destroyed, and so has the Martian government's only hideaway. Excellent job, pilot.

Other attacks against various Martian positions have gone off without a hitch, thanks mainly to the Tereus. Without a decent number of cruisers, our sole destroyer has had to do most of the work herself - but her cutting edge technology and weaponry give her an advantage over the Martians that they cannot hope to match.

Take a break while you can, pilot. You'll be escorting the Tereus when she attacks the Martian Fortress installation and destroys the Republic of Mars once and for all."

We will take $r Fortress station, pilots - by force or by negotiations, $r Mars will be ours once again."

Excellent job retaking Mars from the rebels, pilot. However, of some concern is the successful evacuation of the more important Republic government officials from Fortress station, along with a small contingent of cruisers and freighters. Command suspects they have gone to meet up with the other rebel powers, but which ones, we don't know.

However, that's not important. The capture of Mars and the destruction of their fleet is. Today is a day that will be celebrated forever by Earth as the day Earth struck back."

Three new secondary weapons are also available for our new fighters - Hunters are heat seeking missiles with a phased explosive charge more effective against hulls than shields. Its very heavy hull damage can devastate most enemy strike craft once their shields are gone. The Warrior can consistently strike bombers, and is accurate against fighters when launched from a favourable angle.  A few salvos of Warriors are always bound to do damage. Finally, the Peltaste is a replacement for the Fury dumbfire.  All these secondary weapons can be rearmed using the new drone Cycnus support vessel."

6770, "(fr)Don't fire on the Agility with your Avenger cannon. Engage enemies as far away from the science vessel as possible."

6771, "(fr)Good work! The control station for the solar panels has been captured, all thanks to you. Not only have we gained a vital strategic asset, and weakened our enemy's position, but we have also demonstrated to the rebel powers the strength of our new ships and technology. Morale can be just as effective a weapon as brute force.

The Tereus will now be leading an assault on the Mercurian fleet. We suspect that complete control of the inner colonies is very nearly within our grasp, and destroying the Mercurians will be the first step towards that goal.

You, however, will not take part in the assault. We have a special treat for you, involving the initial deployment of our new 'corvette' class of ship. Stay posted."

First, your escort of the GTD Tereus during the march on Mars, and then the ambush of the Venusian Syndicate's fleet scant moments after the crushing of Mercury! You may not have known it, pilot, but you were taking part in the final battle to secure the inner colonies!

An overview: GTA forces attack Mercury. Two cruisers carrying their leaders escape our attack and flee for Venus. Command, expecting this, puts Operation Hermes into action, sending the first of our new corvettes, the GTCv Skotas, after them. Meanwhile, the Tereus, over in the Asteroid Belt, begins priming its engines.

The Skotas pursues the Mercurian cruisers up to Venus, whereupon the Venusian fleet, eager to save the behinds of their allies, jump in and engage the Skotas. We send in the Tereus, and crush the rebel fleet between our two warships.

This operation was planned out long before the attack on Mercury. Thankfully, the rebels played right into our hands. If they had died to a man, then the assault on Venus would have entailed attacking their cruisers in defended positions, meaning a more costly and more difficult war.

But now's the time to relax and celebrate! The inner colonies have been secured, all thanks to the Skotas, the Tereus, and you. Take some time off. The Alliance won't be needing you until we find the remnants of the Martian fleet."

That said, we did pay a terrible price. The Skotas played her role of bait to the hilt, and was destroyed as a result of that. The first of our corvette class being destroyed on her first mission is not doing wonders for morale. However, the brave sacrifice of her crew in order to make Venus ours will be celebrated for years to come.

But let's not dwell on that now, pilots! Now is the time to relax and celebrate! The inner colonies have been secured, all thanks to the Skotas, the Tereus, and you. Take some time off. The Alliance won't be needing you until we find the remnants of the Martian fleet."

We can always rebuild a destroyer - but rest assured, you will NOT be rebuilding a job, in ANY field."

Finally, Command has stated that we will not be lowering the level of alert, instead remaining in wartime mode for the indefinite future. This has come from the very highest echelons of the GTA, and is down to two very simple things. One, a resurgence in rebel activity could occur at any moment, and 1st Fleet must be ready and waiting - and second, with a rebel Orion destroyer running around, we can't afford to let our guard drop and the enemy in. So don't hope for time off now that the fighting's done, because you've got a lot more work to do next."

6984, "(fr)This new government must be not tolerant, but INTOLERANT! It must not bring peace, but WAR! It must not 'get along', it must crush and subdue all evil, all opposition to it!"

While we're currently at peace with the outer colonies, don't think you've got an easy ride ahead of you - there's still plenty of stuff for you to do, even in peacetime.

Piracy is at an all time high, so we'll be taking a look at this little problem and seeing what we can do about it. The Asteroid Belt has become a very dangerous place to be, these last few months - which causes us some major problems constructing our forward defence outposts."

7000, "(fr)If you happen to have been hiding under a rock these past few years - and by the look of some of you, you have - then you won't know that EA Command has been constructing outposts along the outside of the Asteroid Belt to watch for any Jovian fleet movement towards our planets. Our new Lycaon outposts do a swell job as observer posts and resupply stations for our 'Belt patrol groups. Speaking of which... did I mention there's plenty of stuff for you to do?

Because that's what you're going to do. Patrol."

7001, "(fr)Today, pilots, you will be escorting $g Lambda wing freighters to one of our $b Lycaon outposts along the outer fringes of the $b Asteroid $b Belt. These freighters are carrying important construction materials required to finish and properly equip our new installations, so that we can defend against the $r Jovian threat next door. We've been covering their flight through the $b Belt in shifts, and you're up for the final leg."

7003, "(fr)Since we remain in a state of 'cold war' with the outer colony rebels, the main threat you will be facing will be from the pirate vessels that ply the $b Asteroid $b Belt looking for freighters to ambush and supplies to steal. You're fresh out of flight school and probably far too trigger happy for your own good, so I'll tell it to you straight - don't fire on any rebel craft you see unless they fire on you. The peace we have right now is fragile and tense, but $g Command isn't prepared to fight another war with the rebs because some rookie couldn't keep his fingers off his targeting reticle, alright?"

7007, "(fr)Engage ships at as long a range as possible. Try to avoid fighting near the freighters, as they will get damaged.  Be sure to take out Athenas and Hercs first."

7008, "(fr)Good job preserving the cargo from the pirates, pilot. They escaped with only one container. This assault was unexpected, as pirates tend to go for food and water and other supplies, not construction material. Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht. You did well enough for a rookie."

7009, "(fr)The pirates escaped with two containers, pilot. This assault was unexpected, as pirates tend to go for food and water and other supplies, not construction material. Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht. You did passably for a rookie, though I certainly expected more."

Due to the unusual nature of the attack, details of it have been submitted to Earth Alliance Intelligence's Commissar Schlecht - I'm sure you won't mind, considering your excellent performance. Once again, good job. We need more people like you out here."

7011, "(fr)Remarkably, you kept all of the freighters well protected as well.  The civilian owner of the ships has reached out to me to thank you for your performance."

7012, "(fr)You kept two of the freighters on station as well. We'll send a tug to pick up the rest of the cargo and take it to our outposts.  The Justice can keep it covered for now."

7013, "(fr)You kept two of the freighters on station as well. At least that means we don't have to dispatch a tug to collect any leftover cargo."

They saw off the last of their attackers, but more pirates are likely to arrive in their place, and soon. You're the only wing we've got available right now - we'll try and divert reinforcements to you as soon as possible.

The reasons for the attack on the Justice are unknown, but our motivations are crystal clear - defend that corvette at all costs! Now move!"

7098, "(fr)It is unfortunate that the Justice did not survive this engagement. The loss of a capital ship is a great blow to our morale and our fleet strength, especially when the ship is one of our oldest, and thus most iconic and experienced, corvettes.

Don't beat yourself up about it, pilot. You did the best you could. Now, I'm assigning you to guard duty on the inner side of the 'Belt. There are a number of cargo depots there that need watching, and I think you could benefit from the experience. Dismissed."

Again, due to the unusual nature of this attack, I've contacted EAI and informed them of what happened. So far, the current hypothesis is that the original exodus of petty criminals and enemies of the state - which happened just after the Earth Alliance's securing of the inner colonies in 2340 - also contained a number of radical anti-EA remnants of rebel governments, and it is these elements that are leading the attacks on our forces.

However, you don't need to concern yourself with that. A number of very important people were impressed by your performance today, pilot. Expect great things to be coming your way."

7146, "(fr)My name is Commissar Schlecht, and I am an officer for Earth Alliance Intelligence. We were impressed by your skillful defence of the EACv Justice from a heavy pirate attack, and have selected you and other top pilots for a top secret operation in the outer colonies. This briefing and anything you see, hear or do while working for EAI is and will be classified top secret, violation of which will result in your incarceration and execution."

7147, "(fr)The current major superpowers, apart from ourselves, are the Jovian Coalition and the United Saturnian States. These two planets have enough resources to easily counter our own fleet. The Jovians are known to have at least one modified Orion-class destroyer, the JCD Majesty, and the Saturnians are suspected to have one as well. If these two powers ever came together, they could easily dominate this system."

7148, "(fr)Thankfully, the two maintain a bitter rivalry. Two other powers remain, however - the Uranian-Neptunian Union and the Independent Plutonian Peoples. The main strength of the UNU is their technological superiority, this being due to their controlling the Neptunian science colony. Again thankfully, they have not turned their innovative prowess to military applications."

7149, "(fr)Finally, the Independent Plutonian Peoples - a pitiful excuse for a colony, their entire fleet consists of a few fighter wings and a single Ethon cruiser, the Styx. They continue to exist only on the sufferance of the other powers and by virtue of their weakness.
 
 Our plan is to use the IPP as a cover for a series of strikes against the UNU using old GTA fighter craft. Direct intervention in the area would bring the wrath of the Jovians and Saturnians down on our heads, so you must maintain your disguise during this operation. Disguised as Plutonians, you should be able to do a lot of damage to the UNU before they or the other powers crush the IPP, in which case our ruse will become unworkable. Even so, another power will be crushed and we will be one step closer to a unified Sol."

7150, "(fr)Welcome, pilots. Your first assignment as a crack-squad for the $g EAI will be the destruction of a $r UNU convoy returning from a trading mission to $r Saturn. Although the freighter caravan has a military escort - the $r UNC $r Ahab and two fighter wings - it is mostly made up of civilians.  One of the fighter wing is made up of the UNU's new interceptor, the UNF Alcaeus.  This craft appears to be a better armed and armoured Valkyrie.  The Ahab is a Vidar class cruiser -- a fast new ship intended primarily for convoy escort."

7153, "(fr)Your entry point into this engagement will most likely be several thousand metres away from the civilian convoy. Close the distance rapidly, and destroy every single last one of them. Make this a massacre. The more terrible the attack now, the greater the retaliation against the $r IPP will be."

7154, "(fr)Your cowardice could have cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

7155, "(fr)Congratulations, pilot. You just completed your first Earth Alliance Intelligence mission - the execution of several hundred traitors, and if all goes to plan, many more will join them.

The Uranian-Neptunian Union is quite upset with the IPP over the horrific attack on 'innocent civilians' by Plutonian fighters. The IPP have denied everything - as they would if they really were the perpetrators of the incident. They are playing right into our hands."

After tolerating the brutal attacks of the 'Plutonians' on its ships for long enough, the UNU deployed their destroyer, the UND Tempest, to Tartare station, and finally showed to the world the most impressive and well hidden weapon ever known to man. Flux beam weaponry.

The IPP has been annihilated. Pluto is, once again, a lifeless, uninhabited planet. The Tempest's new weapons gave the weakling Plutonians no chance at all.

This sudden development has halted the war we were about to have with the Jovians, thankfully. I was hoping to have my black operations pilots ready and waiting for this situation, but the way things have turned out... a war with the Jovians is not in our best interests right now, the balance of power not shifted enough in our favour.

Both the Alliance and the Jovians are marshalling their forces for a potential attack on Neptune, but I have other plans which will render such preparations useless. You have an hour, two at most, whereupon I want you to return for briefing immediately. Dismissed."

During a recent attack by the Jovians on EA space, the Neptunians took the opportunity to test a new weapon, the likes of which have only ever been seen on the SSD Lucifer - photon beam cannons.

If the Lucifer's flux weapons are anything to go by, these new weapons could prove to be that which gives the upper hand to the eventual victor of this conflict. We at EA Command are determined that the Earth Alliance will be those victors, and to do that, we must seize those beam cannons immediately.  The Jovian government is also expected to attempt to seize this technology for itself."

7363, "(fr)JOVIAN FLEET UPDATE
Observation of Jovian fleet assets in the previous engagement has allowed intel to provide the summary of their new combat vessels. The Antée is a Jovian fighter faster and more maneuverable than the Hercules but has only one secondary bank and so carries far fewer missiles. The Apollyon is an attempt to merge the capabilities of the Athena class with the ability bomber warheads. The Callisto is a new Jovian strike bomber falling in between in between the Apollyon and Medusa in its capabilities. The Héra is a large bomber with six gun mounts. It has a massive afterburner more than capable of doubling its speed. However it carries fewer bombs than the Ursa and it does not have a defensive turret.  Finally, the Jovians have introduced the Soter line of support cruisers. This class is armed with high velocity missile anti-ship missiles, nicknamed 'HVels', which appear to be derived from Jovian observation of our Skotas class. It has replaced the old Fenris and Leviathan cruiser lines in Jovian service."

7364, "(fr)The entire EA fleet has been mobilised for this operation. Your C.O.s will give you orders straight from High Command. Brand new Claymore Mark II heavy assault fighters are being shipped out to your vessels as they come off the production lines. Available for use with these heavy fighters is the latest in advanced weaponry - the EAW-162 Trantor cannon, the EAM-96 Penetrator anti-subsystem missile and the EAM-42A Stinger missile. Like the original Prometheus upon which it was based, the Trantor does tremendous damage to armor, although it does less well against heavy shielding. The Penetrator replaces the old Stiletto with a smaller weapon which can be carried in larger numbers for great effect against enemy turrets.  Lastly, the Stinger swarm missile improves greatly on the old Hornet and is absolutely lethal to fighters and bombers.
 
 Let nothing stand in your and the Earth Alliance's way. We must have those beam cannons!"

7365, "(fr)You've all read the Command Brief, you know what this is about. But while the $g EA fleet ties up the $r Jovians around $r Jupiter, $g EAI has another job for you.

Due to your experience with operations deep behind enemy lines, you have been chosen to assault $r Neptune's science colony where the beam cannons were developed, and capture the technology for the $g EA."

This proximity to one of the $r UNU's centre of operations makes it one of the most secure $g EA targets in the system."

7370, "(fr)Atlantis"

7371, "(fr)You will jump in a few thousand metres out from the science colony. Your initial objective will be to clear the area for the arrival of one or more of our freighters, which will haul the science cruisers back to $g EA space. If and when such ships arrive, your objective will be to defend them from enemy attack.

You will be flying our new $b Claymore $b Mark II heavy assault fighters which have been brought out from $g Mars specially for this operation. Learn how to use them quickly - we haven't got the time for you to get used to how they handle."

7372, "(fr)The location of the $r UND $r Tempest is still unknown at this time. Be warned - if the $r Tempest shows up, do not attempt to engage it. Wielding these new beam cannons, it currently outclasses every single ship in our arsenal. Don't provoke it.

It is also possible that $r Jovian and $r Saturnian special forces will also attempt a commando raid on the science colony. Do not let them secure the scientists and the technology for their own. We MUST have that beam technology, pilots! We MUST win this war!"

7375, "(fr)The destruction of the Murphy has had consequences far beyond those that are readily apparent, pilot. It means not only the failure of this mission, but in fact the failure of years' worth of preparation and infiltration! YOUR inability to secure the beam cannon technology for EAI has done more than simply give our enemies an advantage we cannot afford to let them have - it has wasted the work of hundreds of operatives and strategists, work that has taken years to perform!

This outright failure has humiliated me, my division, and the rest of EAI in the eyes of High Command! But while my punishment will be exceedingly light, yours will be exceedingly terrible! Execution! 0900 hours tomorrow morning! Dismissed!"

7376, "(fr)Bombers are a priority target, but don't completely ignore the fighters. Try to engage them close to the Tempest. Also, it is possible a particular turret is causing a lot of damage to your charges. If so, locate it and destroy it."

7377, "(fr)The destruction of the Bohr has had consequences far beyond those that are readily apparent, pilot. It means not only the failure of this mission, but in fact the failure of years' worth of preparation and infiltration!

This outright failure has humiliated me, my division, and the rest of EAI in the eyes of High Command! But while my punishment will be exceedingly light, yours will be exceedingly terrible! Execution! 0900 hours tomorrow morning! Dismissed!"

7378, "(fr)Very good work out there today, pilot, very good work indeed. From the jaws of the lion itself we snatched the prize of beam weapon technology, and already the scientists on Earth are installing our own beam weapons on the Tereus. The information gathered from the Bohr will advance the cause of the Earth Alliance by years, even decades.

However, don't pat yourself on the back too hard, pilot. Events have conspired against us. The UNU still have their beam weaponry on the Tempest, and agents report that despite their armed attack on the colony, the Jovian Coalition and the United Saturnian States each received beam cannon prototypes from the UNU. We can only assume the rebels wish to form a unified front against the Alliance. Our dreams of complete technological superiority are not to be."

7379, "(fr)And yet, while this may seem somewhat meaningless in the light of the UNU's sharing of its technology, I would like to thank you for destroying Gemini transports carrying the Neptunian scientists. Without the prototypes and experts carried on those transports, the rebels will have a harder time making their beam weapons - which is obviously a gain for the Earth Alliance. Well done."

7380, "(fr)Worse still, the escape of Saturnian transports - while rendered somewhat meaningless in the light of the UNU's sharing of their technology - will allow the rebels to expedite production of the new beam cannons. If the transports had been destroyed, then several prototypes and scientists well versed in the production of these new weapons would not be around to help the rebel powers create their own beam cannons. As it is, the rebels now have a head start which we must work hard to catch up with."

7381, "(fr)Go straight for Gemini as soon as you enter the field of battle. Bring your wingmen with you, and target Gemini 1 first."

To those of you who were 'borrowed' by EAI, welcome back to the Tereus! You've arrived just in time to begin on a wonderful series of patrol and freighter escort missions! For the rest of you, it'll be business as usual. However, I do have a few announcements from EA Command."

7422, "(fr)Firstly, several new Tereus destroyers, starting with the EAD Arethusa, have been commissioned. The destroyers will take some of the heat off our backs, and will provide extra flexibility for the Earth Alliance, as well as add additional firepower to the fleet."

7423, "(fr)Secondly, our new beam cannon technology. Ever since the destruction of Tombaugh Station by the SSD Lucifer, Terran scientists have been trying to figure out just what makes the Lucifer's beam cannons tick. It appears that the Neptunian science colony cracked the puzzle, and thanks to a successful capture operation by some of our pilots, their findings are now available to the Earth Alliance! Our destroyers are currently being fitted with these new weapons as we speak."

7424, "(fr)Lastly, and while we're on the subject - a long, long time ago, the idea was had for a destroyer devoted purely to offence, a ship that could direct huge amounts of firepower in one direction that would ensure the destruction of whatever vessel it attacked. At the time, only laser turrets were available, and so the idea was scrapped. However, thanks to these new beam cannons, the idea has been resurrected, and a new class of destroyer will be completed in a matter of years - the EAD Lindos. Watch this space."

7425, "(fr)Expecting to go back to patrol duty, pilot? As I said, $g EAI has one more operation for you yet.

You may remember the attack on the $g Justice by pirate forces some time ago. The exact motivations for the pirate assault remain a mystery to us, although we have our suspicions. However, we wish to lift the fog before us, and you will be our lantern bearer."

7426, "(fr)EA"

7427, "(fr)A possible location where we might find out this information is one of the many pirate 'bases' scattered through the $b Asteroid $b Belt - however, they tend to be hidden well, and are typically guarded by a dense belt of mines.  Pirate ships are equipped with a device which deactivates those mines which are nearby to permit them to travel to and from their bases. Attempting to clear these mines would be costly and inefficient, and we cannot jump through the asteroids to the vicinity of a pirate base without a precise set of coordinates. Thus, we must use the pirates themselves to lead us through the minefields to their homes."

7428, "(fr)Macavity"

7429, "(fr)We have selected the $r Macavity, a pirate cruiser not particularly renowned for their competence, as the focus for this operation. $g EAI forces will attack the $r Macavity and cause her to flee. One of our operatives will then follow the $r Macavity through the $b Asteroid $b Belt and its minefields to one of the pirate bases.

You will be that operative."

7430, "(fr)You will follow the cruiser through the $b Asteroid $b Belt until the $r Macavity reaches a pirate base - at all times maintaining a distance of 500 metres to avoid detection. The $b Asteroid $b Belt will mask your engine signature, but a direct visual by the pirates will blow the operation. The Macavity disables any mine within 1000 meters of her.  You therefore must also not stray more than that distance away from her, either.  Once the $r Macavity has led you to the base, and you have made the correct subspace vector calculations, we will then deploy a task force to capture the base and discover more about these pirates. "

7431, "(fr)You have been assigned the Claymore Mk III for the operation.  This variant of the Claymore platform falls in between the original Claymore and Claymore Mark II in combat effectiveness.  It is equipped with an advanced sensor pod that will allow us to establish the best subspace vector for our task force should we need to display it. Remember, a visual sighting of the pirate base is not enough.  We need that subspace vector! We will keep you updated throughout the mission, pilot. Dismissed."

7432, "(fr)Your cowardice cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

7433, "(fr)I'm not sure whether you picked this one up or not, pilot, but this was a STEALTH MISSION! Whether it was due to gross incompetence or outright treachery, I don't know, but you FOULED up the operation BIG TIME! I'll decide what to do with you later, now get out of my sight!"

7434, "(fr)Don't fire anything until the Macavity has led you to the pirate base. Don't get too close to anyone."

7435, "(fr)You were unable to keep up with the Macavity as it fled through the Asteroid Belt. This is most disappointing, pilot. I had expected you to be able to cope with a mission of this simplicity, but evidently you are not as competent as I originally thought.

A second attempt will be made in a few days - however, we will not be calling on you for the honour again. Our next meeting will be the one in which I decide your fate. Dismissed."

7436, "(fr)Don't let anyone scare you too far away from the Macavity. You have three axes to play in - use them well."

7437, "(fr)The destruction of the task force sent to destroy the pirate base is more than disappointing, pilot. If we cannot even destroy a rag-tag band of petty criminals, what hope do we have against the might of the Jovian navy?

The details of the mission have proved troubling to EA Command. Unfortunately, due to your handling of said mission, you are no longer cleared to hear exactly what that means. We'll discuss your failure and the consequences it shall have on your career later, pilot. For now, dismissed."

7438, "(fr)Virgo and Leo are top priority. Remember to assign Delta and Gamma to attack the Monarch and the Lambert before they can do too much damage to the Alexander."

7439, "(fr)This is most troubling, pilot. If the Jovians are in league with the pirates, as the presence of the Monarch seems to indicate, then we have a major political problem - not even considering the question of a powerful military force lurking in the depths of the Asteroid Belt, so very close to our homes on Mars and Earth.

I do not expect you to be concerned with such matters, however. You performed satisfactorily out in the field, successfully tailing the Macavity in a solo operation and then joining in on the attack on the pirate base. I am pleased, pilot. You have shown yourself to be a pilot worthy of EAI status.

EAI wishes to put this matter of the Jovian-pirate alliance on the back burner for a moment, and I wish to do the same with your career. Do not take it amiss, pilot - it is just that now is the time for spies and saboteurs, not for commando raids by the likes of yourself. And although the findings of today's little operation shall remain secret for the time being, your time here at EAI is not at an end.

We have numerous top-secret facilities that our pilots, while they are not serving our cause deep behind enemy lines, guard and keep top secret. You and your squad will be guarding such facilities, as until we require your services once again. Again, as with this Jovian matter, this may not rise up for some time - months, even years or decades. But it will do so eventually.

We'll be in touch."

7538, "(fr)Welcome aboard, pilots. I am Admiral Adie, and I would like to welcome you to the EAD Lindos with warmth and happiness, but recent news from EA Command is less than cheerful.

The EAD Tereus has been destroyed. While she was on a routine sweep of the Asteroid Belt, a heavy pirate attack force attacked and destroyed her. This is a great loss to us all - the Tereus was the flagship of the Earth Alliance and carried many fine pilots. Now that it has been destroyed, and with the EAD Heliades still under construction, our firepower has been greatly reduced. We will miss Admiral Werner greatly."

7539, "(fr)We are now the flagship of the Earth Alliance. The Arethusa will now take the place of the Tereus, and the EAD Resolute will take the Arethusa's place backing us. In the meantime, we are to sweep the Asteroid Belt for pirates and destroy them once and for all. The treacherous monsters will live to regret their attack on the Tereus!"

7540, "(fr)Our first task must be to locate the escape pods that launched from the $g Tereus. Reports from our forces guarding the $g Tereus shortly before her death said that nine escape pods managed to launch from the destroyer and get out into the $b Asteroid $b Belt. We must find those escape pods and bring them home."

7541, "(fr)The escape pods will be found in a radius of 4-5 kilometers around the wreckage of the $g Tereus. Confine your search to within this area.

When you do find the escape pods, you will escort them to the jump out point at the centre of the battlefield. If pirate raiders show up to pick over the remains of the $g Tereus, you may have to defend the pods against them.

Suit up, pilot. The $g EA needs you right now."

7542, "(fr)Your inability to defend ANY of the escape pods from the Tereus is a damning blow to the EA and your career, pilot. We are on the verge of fighting a massive war on multiple fronts, pilot, and we need all the men we can get. However, due to your incompetency, the surviving crew of the Tereus were massacred by pirate forces.

Think about how many people you let die today, pilot. You'll be doing a lot of thinking where you're going."

7543, "(fr)Engage the enemy as far away from the escape pods as possible."

7544, "(fr)You managed to save a number of the Tereus' escape pods. You did fairly well, for a rookie.

The death of the Tereus has rattled EA Command considerably. High Command has been in conference all night, and several commissars are getting quite excited. It is likely that we will be pursuing the pirate question with EAI assistance. As we are - now - the oldest and most experienced crew in the EA fleet, we will be the ones taking the murderous pirates head on. Be prepared for further action, pilots."

7545, "(fr)You could have saved more pods, pilot. Try distracting the enemy with yourself."

7620, "(fr)$g EA $g High $g Command itself has ordered the $g Lindos to sort out the pirate problem once and for all. With the aid of Commissar Reed from $g EAI, we have plotted out a two-part operation that should solve the problem handily.

We suspect the pirates maintain a central base of operations, an installation where they manufacture the weapons and ships that they use. While their outposts are easy to find, this pirate installation has evaded all attempts to find it - through sensor detection or by following pirates back to it."

7621, "(fr)The second phase of the operation will be concerned with destroying this installation. The first phase will involve discovering the location of the installation.

$g EAI has very generously donated us some prototype sensor systems that are capable of scanning individual subsystems in a small capital ship to a high degree of accuracy. We shall be using these new systems to discover the location of the pirate installation."

7622, "(fr)The cruiser $g EAC $g Lantern will attack one of the pirates' smuggling outposts, the $r Drexler. This attack should draw out various pirate cruisers on patrol in the area to defend the $r Drexler. Hopefully, one of these ships will have the co-ordinates for the pirate installation stored in their navigation systems.

$g Alpha $g 1 will be flying solo for this operation. You will escort the $g Lantern on the approach to the $r Drexler, so that the attacking force seems neither overwhelming nor pathetic.

I am disappointed in you, pilots. You were unable to restrain your fire and keep the target cruisers alive. Meanwhile, Alpha 1, you were unable to scan the cruisers quickly enough to gather the information we needed. Unimpressive, pilot.

A second task force has been selected for the second attempt at this operation... if it is still feasible, that is. You, in the meantime, will be assigned patrol duty and grunt work. Dismissed."

Yes, that's right, pilot. The 'Belt is now the front lines in a war that's been simmering away for over thirty years. EAI has confirmed the presence of Jovian ships at the pirate installation, showing that the Jovians were supplying and encouraging the pirate attacks on the Earth Alliance. The commissars have given the go-ahead for the EA to declare war against the Jovian Coalition in retaliation for the underhanded acts of aggression via their pirate proxies.

Our engineers have delivered a new weapon just in time for this new conflict - the EAW-62b Aratrum.  This is a close range shotgun type weapon that can chew up bombers and larger vessels with ease. 

Even as we speak, the declaration of war should be being received in Throne Installation right now. What the Jovian response will be is unknown, but EA High Command has made it clear - this is war in Sol again, and this time, it shall be the last."

7746, "(fr)With the recent Jovian attack repelled, we are free to begin our counterstrike. EA Command has decided that this will be the last and final campaign - this war will not be over until all the traitors have been destroyed and Sol is unified under the Earth Alliance banner!

The EAD Lindos has been deployed to Pluto. Now uninhabited after the Neptunians destroyed the IPP fifteen years ago, Pluto is the perfect place for the Lindos to station itself and begin attacks on the Uranian-Neptunian Union."

7747, "(fr)Our overall strategy is for the Lindos to swiftly crush the UNU, and then to advance on Saturn. Meanwhile, the Arethusa, Resolute, Freedom and Yorktown will harass the Jovians and thus prevent them from deploying their fleet to interfere with our operation. Then, our forces will converge on Jupiter and crush the rebels between the two forces."

7748, "(fr)The latest fighter from our scientists has made its way to the Lindos in time for our redeployment to Pluto. The EAF Stentor is the ancient Valkyrie design made new using the latest EA technological advances. Faster than any GTA ship ever made, the Stentor will outclass anything the UNU can throw at us."

7749, "(fr)The $g Lindos will arrive in orbit around $b Pluto in a few minutes. $g Alpha and $g Beta, you are being sent there ahead of time to pave the way for the $g Lindos.

While $b Pluto has been devoid of life ever since the One Day War, it is possible that a $r UNU detachment will come to investigate the sudden appearance of an $g EA destroyer in the outer colonies. In such an event, you will protect the $g Lindos until we can sortie more wings. Suit up, pilot."

7750, "(fr)Your failure to defend the Lindos is absolutely disgraceful, pilot. You allowed a capital ship - a CAPITAL SHIP - to be destroyed by the Neptunian strike force.

A foul-up of this calibre cannot go unpunished. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for the crime of gross negligence resulting in the death of thousands of members of the Earth Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

7751, "(fr)You may need to divide your resources - use your wingmen to either guard Delta and Epsilon or to disarm the cruisers, depending on which one you excel at and which one you find difficult. Just make sure not to forget about the bombers or the beams!"

7752, "(fr)With a forward command post established around Pluto, a small fleet can begin trickling in deep behind enemy lines. We won't catch the UNU napping, but with our superior technology and ships, we won't need to.

Tomorrow, you will lead the attack on Atlantis station. Command hopes that with the loss of one half of the UNU, the Uranians will surrender and negotiate for their survival. The UNU will be the first rebel power to fall, but it will not be the last.

Do not worry about the time it took to repair the engine malfunction, pilot - the Lindos will be fully functional and ready to support you on the attack on the Neptunian fleet. The technicians responsible for the failure have been executed - their incompetence will worry the EA no more."

7792, "(fr)An Old Foe"

7793, "(fr)The $g Lindos is ready and in position to attack $r Neptune. Only one thing stands in our way: the $r Tempest.

The $r Tempest is currently stationed at $r Atlantis station, waiting for our strike so it can respond with devastating force. In order to minimise the risk to our lone destroyer, $g Command has ordered that an initial wave of fighters and bombers be sent in to clear the way for the $g Lindos."

7794, "(fr)$g Alpha will fly bombers, $g Beta will cover them. You will both jump in at $r Atlantis station a few minutes before the $g Lindos does. $g Alpha, your objective is to destroy the $r Tempest's primary and port side beam cannons in order to make it defenceless against the $g Lindos' beams. $b Shriekers are available to you, but we recommend using $b Hellstorm bombs in their place due to their greater effectiveness."

7795, "(fr)The $g Lindos cannot wait forever, pilot - its current position is obvious to all and leaves it open to assault from $r UNU cruiser wings, so sooner or later it will have to jump in and attack the $r Tempest. Try and disarm the $r Tempest before that happens, pilot."

7796, "(fr)The ultimate goal of this operation, pilot, is the destruction of all $r UNU forces near $r Neptune. Whatever happens with the $g Lindos and the $r Tempest's main guns, your primary objectives are the destruction of the $r UNU's command ship, the $r Tempest, and the $r destruction of all $r UNU ships in the area.

Suit up, pilot. We're on a timer here."

7797, "(fr)The destruction of the Lindos is the defeat of our offensive. The UNU has survived our assault and is now ready to join the Jovians in a new attack on the Asteroid Belt.

Your failure is most disappointing, pilot. You will be brought up before a military tribunal in a few weeks, where you will be given your punishment. Expect, at the very least, expulsion from the ranks of the EA and imprisonment for several years for crimes of gross negligence. Dismissed."

7798, "(fr)You have to move quickly to disarm the Tempest's beams. Go for the ones facing the Lindos first, then tackle the rest. Also, when the cruisers attack the Lindos, the Harpoon cruiser is a priority target - take it out first, then go for the other ships."

7799, "(fr)A stunning victory for the Earth Alliance! This first strike bodes well for our offensive!

The destruction of the Atlantis has had two benefits - firstly, Neptune is no longer under UNU control. Secondly, with one full half of their union gone, the UNU has been seriously weakened and we are hoping for terms of surrender from the Uranians coming through over the next few days."

7800, "(fr)This development will hopefully negate the problem of the Tempest entirely, which escaped our attack and fled to Uranus. Thanks to your efforts, however, it is seriously weakened - replacing its destroyed beam cannons should take some time, hopefully more time than the UNU have available. Anyway, good job with that, pilot."

7801, "(fr)This development will hopefully negate the problem of the Tempest entirely, which escaped our attack and fled to Uranus. With its beam cannons still operational, the Tempest could prove to be a serious problem to our offensive if this surrender treaty does not come through."

7802, "(fr)If you had been able to destroy the Tempest's beams before it jumped out, then we would not have to worry about the Tempest at all."

7803, "(fr)You are also to be commended for your attempt to disable the Tempest so it could not flee the battlefield. Your foresight is impressive, pilot - if only the Tempest's commander had not caught on to what you were doing, then the Tempest would not be holed up in Uranus right now. A good show of initiative there, pilot."

7804, "(fr)Your attempt to immobilise the Tempest is to be commended, however. If the Tempest had not been able to flee the battlefield, then we would have been able to destroy her and strike a huge blow for the EA in the process. Good show of initiative there, pilot - keep it up."

7805, "(fr)You failed to destroy the Tempest's primary beam, pilot.  As a result we could not send in the Lindos and had to abandon the entire operation. With its beam cannons still operational, the Tempest will prove to be a serious problem to our offensive. Almost certainly this surrender treaty will not come through."

The Lindos will move up to the Uranian capital of Titania, the largest moon of Uranus to oversee the disarming of the Uranian fleet. Their ships will be dismantled for parts and their crews imprisoned for treason against the Earth Alliance. Then, we shall start the second phase of the campaign - conquering Saturn."

7839, "(fr)$g Alpha, you will take the last watch overseeing the disarmament of the $r Uranian fleet. Most of the crews of the various $r UNU ships have been arrested already, but as the $r Uranians insist on doing this in stages, their leader Admiral Owen and a small contingent of crew remain on the $r Tempest. They shall be removed during your watch, and the $r Tempest will then be scrapped. The Uranian fleet has accordingly been assigned a friendly IFF code."

Your main priorities are ensuring the survival of the $g Lindos and the destruction of the $r Tempest - secondary objectives include the destruction of the rest of the $r UNU fleet, plus whatever other hostiles forces are present. In the case of such a situation arising, orders will be issued to you by $g Command. You are being issued Penetrator anti-subsystem missiles in case any overzealous Uranian tries to start something.. Dismissed."

7843, "(fr)The escape of the Tempest has undone everything that we have been working towards on Neptune and Uranus, pilot. A carefully negotiated surrender, seeing the end of the UNU without putting any more EA personnel at risk - a boon beyond our wildest dreams - has been wasted, completely and utterly. The rebel warmongers have escaped to safety.

Twice now you have failed the Earth Alliance. Twice it was your task to destroy the Tempest, and twice the Tempest has escaped. Once, we could accept - but to fail a second time is too much. We shall ensure you do not fail the Earth Alliance again. You are being sent back to Earth, to be kept in one of EAI's high security detention centres. Your fate shall be decided later. Dismissed."

7844, "(fr)The Tempest must not escape. Attack its engines - you don't have to completely destroy them, just get to them fast enough that the Tempest can't escape before the Lindos arms its beam cannons."

7845, "(fr)At last, the UNU has finally been destroyed. The death of Admiral Owen and the Tempest is the death of the Uranians and the Neptunians. Another rebel power falls to the might of the Earth Alliance, and we are another step closer to complete control of the Sol system.

The war isn't quite over yet, though. Even though the EA greatly surpasses the Jovians and the Saturnians, the commissars suspect that the rebels will fight to the bitter end. They are convinced of their own superiority - and their pride shall be their downfall.

It must not be ours, however. The Jovians and Saturnians are still fully fledged powers, and the addition of refugee UNU ships, no matter how few, has only bolstered their ranks. If they manage to disrupt the momentum of our attack, we could be forced into the defensive, and it is a short step indeed between the defensive and the end. Stay sharp out there, pilot."

7891, "(fr)Reinforcements from Earth have arrived - namely the EAD Resolute. The Resolute will join us on the assault on Saturn, while the rest of the fleet continues to engage the rebels in the Asteroid Belt. With seven destroyers on our side to counter the JCD Majesty, the JCD Empress, the JCD Imperial, the USD Eternity and the USD Constant, we now outmatch the rebels in numbers, and far surpass them in firepower."

7892, "(fr)Other, less noticeable but still just as important reinforcements in the form of the EAC Aesacus have also arrived. The Aesacus is an anti-fighter cruiser primarily intended for escort missions. While the majority of these have been sent to the Asteroid Belt, EA Command has sent a number to our position to help clean out the Saturnian threat."

7893, "(fr)Also, new Gagana heavy bombers have arrived. These massive ships have been developed in tandem with the new Hell Fire torpedo, an anti-destroyer weapon based on the old Harbinger bomb. These new developments complete the Earth Alliance fleet and will prove most useful in bringing the rebels to their knees swiftly and decisively.  Gagana bombers inflicted severe damage on the USD Constant in their very first engagement."

7894, "(fr)$r Saturn is currently under the thumb of the $r United $r Saturnian $r States, a superpower that emulates the $r Jovian $r Coalition in every way possible. It rules from the $r USI $r Hourglass, and as our ships advance through the $r Saturnian system, it appears that they have withdrawn there in their hour of need. Of course, their installation is guarded by their two destroyers - the $r USD $r Constant and their flagship, the $r USD $r Eternity."

7896, "(fr)Our plan of attack is a two pronged assault - the $g Lindos moving in on one side, the $g Resolute on the other. Your task shall be to protect both of these ships while they make their assault. Focus on fighters and bombers - the destroyers will handle the capital ship combat. The Constant has already suffered damage in a previous engagement.  Be sure neither she nor the Eternity escape. Dismissed."

7897, "(fr)The destruction of not only one of our major capital ships, but also the flagship of the Earth Alliance, is a greivous blow, both in terms of the loss of men and firepower, and also in terms of morale. Your failure today cost us the mission, the Lindos and Saturn - Hourglass station remains in the hands of the USS, and so does the rest of the planet.

For your failure here today you are hereby dismissed from active service in the Earth Alliance pending a re-evaluation of your skills and abilities. Until then, you'll be spending your time back on Earth. Dismissed, pilot."

7898, "(fr)You need to take out both cruiser groups as quickly as possible - consider splitting your team up to take them both out. Also, you need only destroy the main beam cannon on each of the cruisers in order to save the destroyers - you can blow them up later."

7899, "(fr)The destruction of one of our major capital ships is a greivous blow, both in terms of the loss of men and firepower, and also in terms of morale. Your failure today cost us the mission, the Resolute and Saturn - Hourglass station remains in the hands of the USS, and so does the rest of the planet.

For your failure here today you are hereby dismissed from active service in the Earth Alliance pending a re-evaluation of your skills and abilities. Until then, you'll be spending your time back on Earth. Dismissed, pilot."

7900, "(fr)Well done, pilot. Saturn is in our hands, and another rebel power bites the dust. The meagre Saturnian defence was not enough to destroy the Lindos or the Resolute, thanks to your intervention.

Unfortunately, once again, the rebels have made their escape. The leaders of the USS fled to Jupiter on board the USD Eternity. There, they will reinforce the Jovian position.

This is This is regrettable, pilot, but at least we can claim a moral victory - the rebels are packing up and fleeing from their homes. The EA juggernaut of war is unstoppable, and the only hope for the rebs is to run away like the cowardly dogs they are. Soon, they will have nowhere to run to.

Our fleet has started to converge on Jupiter. The day after tomorrow, the attack will commence. The Jovian Coalition's time has almost run out."

Before the attack on $r Jupiter and the $r Coalition can begin, we must scour the rebel threat from $b Saturn - else our fleet would be dangerously open to attack from behind."

7964, "(fr)$g Alpha and $g Beta, you have been assigned to escort the $g Formidable, a new $b Aesacus cruiser as she patrols along the rings of $b Saturn.

Thanks to your incompetence, EA forces have been redirected from the Jovian front to help with the cleaning up of the Saturnians. Now, not only has our push for Jupiter been delayed, but our defences weakened as well.

I would not be surprised if the Jovians attempted a sally against our blockade tomorrow, and I would not be surprised if you were the one blamed for the ensuing casualties. Pilot, I'm keeping you grounded for a while. Perhaps you could use the time to brush up on your piloting skills in the training simulator."

7968, "(fr)Good watch out there, pilot. The rebs are taking casualties across the Saturnian system - whether they're running, hiding or fighting, our little fleet out here is tackling them head on.

The final push on Jupiter will take place very soon, very soon indeed. High Command is sending up some 'heavy firepower' to lead the attack, so we'll have to wait until it arrives. In the meantime, we keep the Jovians contained. They know it's the end for their pretend government. They know they're going down."

Everything is in place for the final attack.

8052, "(fr)THE FOLLOWING IS CLASSIFIED AND STRICTLY FOR EARTH ALLIANCE PERSONNEL ONLY. REVEALING THE CONTENTS OF THIS BRIEF TO UNAUTHORISED CIVILIANS IS PUNISHABLE BY INCARCERATION AND EXECUTION FOR TREASON."

8053, "(fr)During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of an entire fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and was promptly dismissed."

8054, "(fr)The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Almost forty years ago, the SSD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN ship that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work."

8055, "(fr)With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began."

8056, "(fr)The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over twenty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed."

8057, "(fr)We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come."

8058, "(fr)The campaign is nearly over. An attempted strike by the Jovian fleet was swiftly put down with the destruction of the JCD Empress. Only three destroyers remain - the JCD Majesty, the JCD Imperial and the USD Eternity. They and whatever are left of the rebels are no match for the Earth Alliance, not with the EASD Nemesis on station. With their destruction, the Sol system will finally be united once more, but this time under the rule of the Earth Alliance, and this time we shall never let go."

8059, "(fr)With the arrival of $g Nemesis from the shipyards on $g Mars, all is in place for the final battle of this war. The $g Lindos and the $g Resolute are preparing to assault the $r Io installations, the $g Freedom and $g Arethusa the $r Europa settlements and the $g Nadine and $g Yorktown the $r Ganymede cruiser detachments."

8060, "(fr)Nemesis"

8061, "(fr)The $g Nemesis, meanwhile, will strike at the very heart of the $r Jovian $r Coalition. The $r Imperial, the $r Eternity and the $r Majesty have all arrayed themselves around the $r JCI $r Throne installation, the rebel headquarters and their last hiding place. The $g Nemesis will be deployed against them."

8062, "(fr)Throne"

8063, "(fr)The rebel defences will be tough to breach, but we are confident that the $g Nemesis will weather the storm. As you will be escorting the $g Nemesis into firing position and defending it from the last-ditch rebel efforts to destroy it, then the glory, duty and responsibility for striking the last blow to finally end this long, long civil war... also rests on your shoulders. Succeed, and you will be a hero. Fail, and our wrath will know no boundaries. Is that understood?

Get to your ships, pilots. Victory awaits."

8064, "(fr)Your incompetence forced the Nemesis to be withdrawn, pilot. Thankfully, although a grievous blow to the EA, it has not completely negated our attack - unlike YOU, other forces have managed to capture several key Jovian positions, including Io, Callisto and Europa.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.
Dismissed."

8065, "(fr)Get the bombers quickly.  Peltastes will help."

8066, "(fr)Your incompetence allowed the Nemesis to be destroyed, pilot. Thankfully, although a grievous blow to the EA, it has not completely negated our attack - unlike YOU, other forces have managed to capture several key Jovian positions, including Io, Callisto and Europa.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.

I simply cannot emphasise just how many people lost their lives when you allowed that superdestroyer to be destroyed, pilot. Your performance was not only unacceptable according to the standards of the Earth Alliance fleet - EA High Command itself has personally issued a warrant for your execution for gross negligence to the point of high treason. Popular opinion is vastly in favour of having you put to death immediately, but we here like to take things a little more slowly than that. Dismissed."

8067, "(fr)Bombs and bombers are always priority targets. Ditto beam cannons on the destroyers."

8068, "(fr)A truly inspiring performance there, pilot. You defended the Nemesis, flagship of the Earth Alliance fleet, from bomber attack, rebel destroyers AND a cunning trap, with no concern for your own survival, and thus ensured the victory of the EA over the last of the rebels. Tremendous job!

This is, of course, the end of the war. The only power in the Sol system now is the Earth Alliance - but we do not stand unchallenged. Rebellious undercurrents of society may seek to overturn and destroy all that we hold dear at any moment... plus, there is still the matter of whatever lurks in the shadows of Delta Serpentis...

The Shivans are still out there, pilot, and one day we shall have to face them.

But with the Nemesis on station, both fears of Shivan invasion and civilian rebellion can be allayed. Our new flagship - yes, the Lindos has finally been retired - will serve us well as the most powerful tool in the Earth Alliance arsenal.

In the meantime - congratulations! Your performance shall go down in the annals of history as something for future pilots to aspire to, and as part of the deciding factors in the EA's winning of this so very long civil war."

8170, "(fr)'Eventually, the Jovians were cornered - all other planets were under EA control, and a fleet of warships surrounded their home. A desperate attempt by the once again unsupported Empress to destroy the headquarters of EA High Command failed."

8171, "(fr)Their only choice was to stand and fight. While the more romantic of us might express feelings of admiration for the 'gutsy' rebels, one believes that the decision was born less out of idealism and more out of an inability to do anything else."

8172, "(fr)'The final attack came in the form of a multi-pronged attack. Pairs of EA destroyers each led attacks on various rebel positions within the system of Jupiter's moons."

8173, "(fr)The only exception was the assault on the Jovian headquarters and the three surviving rebel capital ships - Eternity, Imperial and Majesty - which was led by Nemesis."

8174, "(fr)'Curiously, while the Tereus was popular with the people for its longevity and familiarity and despised by High Command for extremely high repair costs and constant retrofits,"

8175, "(fr)a new and untested Nemesis was the prize of the EA but distrusted by the populace. Regardless, it was the Nemesis, with its heavy armour and powerful weaponry, that struck the deathblow against the rebels."

8176, "(fr)'With the end to any further possible hostilities - save the re-opening of the Delta Serpentis jump node - one might expect an end to the various security measures limiting the freedoms of the population. "

8177, "(fr)However, this was not to be. In hindsight, truth, the end of conflict in the Sol system did not bring about an era of eternal peace and enlightenment... but the general unwillingness of High Command to relinquish power is somewhat worrying."

8178, "(fr)'Furthermore, the end of the war saw further mobilisation, not demobilisation. More warships were built, more fightercraft constructed... the creation of the EAI Timoros, despite the absence of any foreign hostile power,"

8179, "(fr)should be indication enough of the Earth Alliance's desire to strengthen military, and thus its own, power against giving power back to the people.'  Excerpt from TP Andersen's 'The Sol System 2335-2372'"

8181, "(fr)Things are not looking good for the Alliance... The Shivan Lucifer evaded the Bastion in Sirius, and is even now preparing to make the jump from Delta-Serpentis to Sol. As a pilot of the Galactic Terran Alliance's finest, a wing leader for Sol's 1st Fleet, you must engage the Lucifer when it arrives in Sol and buy time for the evacuations, with your life if necessary. This is the Sol system, 2335."

8183, "(fr)Five years ago, the planets of the Sol system rose up against the Galactic Terran Alliance and declared independence in the most violent and bloody way possible. At the end of the war, both sides were exhausted, and so the GTA was allowed to continue to exist - but only on Earth and the immediate area of space. Now, in 2340, you have been selected by Command to participate in a special high-risk operation that risks - or intends - open war..."

8185, "(fr)Cold war... an uneasy peace hangs between the Earth Alliance and the rebel powers of the outer colonies. All eyes are turned to the Asteroid Belt, where the EA constructs ring after ring of defensive outposts, and ragtag pirate raiders, criminals and political refugees fleeing the wrath of the EA, attack freighter convoys in order to survive. You are a pilot for the Earth Alliance in the 'Belt, but perhaps you are destined for greater things..."

8186, "(fr)Sol 2372"

8187, "(fr)The end is nigh. Both the Earth Alliance and the rebel powers have been engaged in an alternating secret war of technology and subterfuge for over thirty years. But now, the silence is no longer a respite from the horrors of war. Both sides itch to rid themselves of the other, and both sides marshal their forces for when the bubble of peace finally pops. And it is into this charged environment that you, pilot for the EA, have been thrown and in which you must survive."
