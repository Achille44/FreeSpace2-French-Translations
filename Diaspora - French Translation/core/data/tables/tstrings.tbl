1504, "DRADIS contact, Cylon basestar. We are reading incoming raiders."

1507, "Contact! One ship. Appears to be Colonial. We're receiving a distress signal. Four more contacts right behind it. Cylon raiders!"

1508, "Red wing, intercept those raiders. All other squadrons hold formation near the Indart."

1509, "Help us! They killed everyone!"

1510, "This is the Battlestar Galactica to all Colonial vessels. All ships are to rendezvous at Ragnar Anchorage. Repeat, rendezvous at Ragnar Anchorage."

1511, "Cylon forces have jumped in beneath us. All wings, fall back and engage them. We can not risk firing weapons in close range of the civilians."

1520, "Pilots, we are arming all remaining nuclear warheads. VLS tubes 1-12 are now armed."

1521, "Theseus, at that range it's suicide..."

1522, "We know that. Get those FTL drives spooled and get the hell out of here."

1523, "Cylon nuclear missiles inbound!"

1524, "Sabazius to Theseus. We don't have enough firepower to keep these warheads from coming through. However, we're going to do our part to even the odds. Setting course for the lead baseship at flank speed. Make sure these people make it to safety."

1525, "We did it... more of the civilians managed to escape..."

1526, "Thank you pilots. Making the jump to Ragnar... now!"

1527, "Pilots, give us cover for another minute... If you could just buy us that much more time we can also make it to Ragnar..."

1528, "Thank you pilots... thank you..."

1529, "Theseus to all wings. We are detecting multiple atmospheric nuclear detonations. Aerilon... is burning."

1530, "Theseus... the Golden Eagle... her reactor is running too hot for anyone aboard to still be alive..."

1531, "Pilots, get away from that transport NOW!"

1532, "What the hell was that?"

1533, "Golden Eagle, you are on a fast approach with the Theseus."

1534, "Golden Eagle please respond. Reduce speed and alter your approach vector or we will be forced to consider you hostile and engage."

1535, "Pilots, the Golden Eagle is on a collision course with the Theseus. You must... neutralize the transport..."

1536, "Sir, you can't be asking us to do that... There could be thousands aboard..."

1537, "You have your orders."

1538, "No contacts since the Theseus arrived. We might actually pull this off..."

1539, "We might be lucky, but look at the planet below us. It's only a matter of time before the Cylons attack Aerilon and we can't do a damn thing about it."

1540, "Limit wireless to essential comms only pilots."

1541, "The Cylons are breaking off of the Golden Eagle."

1549, "All enemies destroyed. Indart, how is that fuel coming?"

1550, "We're almost dry. I think it's time we got the hell out of here."

1551, "We read you Indart. Commencing undocking procedure on your mark."

1552, "The Indart's crew is aboard. Good work pilots."

1553, "We are reading two wings of Heavy Raiders, designated Ion and Jack. They are targeting the civilians."
