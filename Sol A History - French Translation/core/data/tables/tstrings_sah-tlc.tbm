5544, "The Great War"

5545, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

Evidently, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

5546, "Subspace"

5547, "In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

5548, "Shivans"

5549, "Despite what information we've been able to obtain, Shivans still remain, on many levels, an enigma to both the Terrans and the Vasudans.  Their origin and their destination remain unknown.  While many have offered up possible explanations as to why the Shivans seem focused on the destruction of all other sentient species, we still do not know why they seem bent on total xenocide.

Shivans have multiple eyes, some of which seem to have the function of compound eyes, not unlike some varieties of insects.  Shivans also have five legs, and can run equally well over a floor or over a ceiling.  It has been hypothesized that Shivans may have spent their evolutionary process in a zero-gravity environment.  Each Shivan leg ends in a very strong claw, capable of crushing even the sturdiest of known alloys.  Parts of their thorax seem to act as compartments, such as ones that might be found on a space suit.  It has been suggested that what we have actually seen have been either robots or organic creatures in some sort of exo-skeleton.  However, we have, at present, no reason to support either hypothesis.

Most likely, we will not learn anything more about the Shivan species until we have actually captured and studied a Shivan."

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

Its three main armament types - swarm missiles, cluster and heavy flak guns, and the notorious 'Gattler', are very lethal against fighters that get too close. Her secondary armament includes two small rail-cannons for use against capital ships. All this firepower in such a small frame does not come without a price, of course, as the Eclipse pays for this with a low engine output."

Armed with the EA's rapid fire projectile turret, the Aesacus is designed to take down enemy strikecraft, while a single railgun can also provide limited firepower against capital ship opponents. Our analysts believe that Aesacus is very radical redesign of Leviathan cruiser, developed by some different contractor than solar branch of Han-Ronald Corporation. The Aesacus is mainly deployed as an escort for larger warships and convoys, but the Earth Alliance has also occasionally deployed Aesacus-class cruisers to intercept fighter squadrons to devastating effect. GTVA fighters and bombers should approach Aesacus with extreme caution."

The Dikastes is the most unique of the Transjovian warships fielded by the Earth Alliance to date.  The Dikastes is a sophisticated unit that specializes in long-range surgical strikes using its destroyer-grade spinal beam cannon.  Our analysts believe that Dikastes is in fact, a Soter or Proxenos mainframe reworked to house a massive reactor directly linked with with beam cannon and unique stabilizer device. Displaying obvious similarities to Apothess-class destroyers, Dikastes seems to be a result of reverse-engineered vasudan technology scanned during Alliance's siege on the Ishtar installation utilizing GVD Sebek. It remains unknown for us how TransJovians managed to reproduce it so fast, and significantly decrase size of the whole device. Dikastes is an extremely dangerous threat to Alliance vessels. Capable of bristling all of her firepower from 11,5 clicks, a wing of Dikastes cruisers is capable of neutralizing a destroyer-grade targer as efficiently as infamous, opening salvo of Lindos class destroyers and remain beyond range of any potential backlash fire. Despite being armed in decent point defence screen, main drawback of Dikastes is her vulnerability to fighter and bomber strikes. Focusing device is extremely large and produce enormous amount of radiation, so all of the components had to be installed outside the ship. Additionally such large beam weapon needs to radiate all the heat directly into space making it's core systems exposed. Those features should be compensated by GTVA's strike units. Without her main beam Dikastes is a minimal threat, but TjD seems to be very protective about warships of this class, and often deploying multiple wings of fighters to protect Dikastes class warships. Very few examples were ever encountered. This fact lead our analysts to conclusion, that Dikastes is a prototype warship deployed in limited numbers to evaluate both the ship and subspace focusing technology for beam weaponry. "

6445, "THE FOLLOWING IS CLASSIFIED AND STRICTLY FOR EARTH ALLIANCE PERSONNEL ONLY. REVEALING THE CONTENTS OF THIS BRIEF TO UNAUTHORISED CIVILIANS IS PUNISHABLE BY INCARCERATION AND EXECUTION FOR TREASON.

During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper-hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of a fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and promptly dismissed.

The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Just over fifty years ago, the SD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN fleet that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work.

With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began.

The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over thirty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed.

We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come."

It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity.

However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to wings of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.

It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.

The Lilith should be considered a class A threat to any ships that encounter it."

It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.

The Cain is a class B threat."

6519, "SD Demon"

It wields three massive flux cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation.  The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.

Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.  If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a class A threat."

Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all Leviathan cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds."

6665, "Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.  Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity."

6666, "As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used in convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.

The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a class C threat."

6669, "Sahr Corporation"

6670, "Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit, with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good payload makes it the most versatile fighter in the PVN."

6671, "The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.

What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  In the hands of a skilled pilot, it is extremely difficult to hit.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses-class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non-registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission."

Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding, make this one of the most well-designed interceptors in the galaxy.

However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.

With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.  Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.

When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non-utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the obliteration of the 4th Fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.

The Typhon is considered a class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup."

6739, "The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan navy.  However, these fighters are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load these ships with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias IV, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.

Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat."

6740, "GVF Anubis"

6741, "PVB Amun"

6742, "Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.  Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.  Used against capital ships."

6743, "The Amun is the Vasudans' heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least three Orion-class destroyers in the past two years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.

The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations."

6748, "GVFr Bast"

6749, "VC 3"

6750, "The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are capable of atmospheric as well as deep-space deployment.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our standard cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability."

6751, "PVS Scarab"

6752, "The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur, and we believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in-flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned."

6753, "GVS Scarab"

6754, "SF Mara (terrans)"

6755, "The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quickly as possible.  It is fast and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur."

With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.

Like our GTSC Faustus, the Imhotep can fill a variety of scientific roles, including performing on-board research and conducting sensor surveys.

These pods are frequently launched to augment the Imhotep's on-board systems."

6804, "Vasudan Probe"

Designed to work in collaboration with an Imhotep science cruiser or as part of team of probes, it is capable of numerous roles including observation, experimentation, and scientific analysis.  It is often possible for a wing of probes to conduct minor missions independent of outside supervision, allowing Vasudan Command to reserve their Imhoteps for deployment where the personal presence of scientists is most needed."

Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.

It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more than secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small missile capacity."

6829, "SF Gorgon"

6830, "The first encounter with the SF Gorgon was made by the GTD Saratoga in the Ikeya system.  We are uncertain if this is a new Shivan design or if the Shivans have simply held this particular class of ship back for the majority of the war.  The ship's unusual design not only provides it with exceptional maneuverability, but also allows it to generate an extremely powerful shield.  So far these ships have only been sighted leading wings of lesser fighters, but there have been reports of entire wings of Gorgons in larger forces.

Little else is known about the Gorgon.  It should be considered a class B threat when acting as a wing leader, but a full wing of Gorgons is to be treated as a class A threat to all allied vessels."

 Overall, the GTB Apollo is a very versatile craft and can perform multiple roles, ranging from precision strikes on large capital ships' subsystems to assignments as assault fighter or bomber in attack runs on smaller craft, all the while doing well in dogfights.
 Despite this, the higher production cost when compared to the standard issue Apollo, make the bomber variant a much more rare sight in the fleet, with only a few ships issued to specialized squadrons."

6840, "GTF Latona"

6841, "An evolution of the old Apollo class, the Latona is more heavily armed and better shielded than its older counterpart and solves the weapon compatibility issues which had reduced overall usage of the Apollo in recent years.

Far larger than its original counterpart, the Ethon has over twice the number of turrets of the Fenris and Leviathan and is capable of mounting multiple missile turrets.  The Ethon was developed on Mars as a means to leverage the large investments already made in Fenris tooling and manufacturing facilities but also to provide a modern and capable cruiser design. Ethons have been sold to many governments in the Solar System, as have licenses to manufacture the cruiser. "

6849, "GTGs Skjoldr (Assault)"

6850, "The Assault Skjoldr (or Heavy Skjoldr) is a refit of the standard model Skjoldr Gunship, originally optimised to eliminate Vasudan capital ships. Although the Assault Skjoldr retains the paired, rotating light Fusion Mortar turrets of the normal gunship, its offensive anti-ship are augmented by a magazine of forty antiship missiles feeding eight independent torpedo launchers. Although limited in endurance thanks to its relatively small magazine, and completely reliant on friendly fighters or escorting capital ships to provide anti-fighter cover, the Assault Skjoldr is capable of delivering a great deal of damage."

6851, "GTGs Skjoldr"

6852, "The Skjoldr Gunship was originally deployed only twelve months before the commencement of hostilities with the Vasudans. Equipped with a pair of rotating light Fusion mortar turrets, its anti-ship damage output is comparable to that the main weapon of a Fenris cruiser, although its considerably smaller magazine means that, in ship to ship combat, its endurance may be an issue. However, though equipped to tackle Vasudan capital ships, the primary mission of the Skjoldr is anti-fighter. Its port and starboard batteries of heat seeking missiles are optimised to engage small strikecraft, both in defence of larger vessels and in offensive roles.  Production of a modified version of the original Skjoldr Gunship has been resumed on Mars.  It can be assumed that it will have found its way into the hands of other governments hostile to the GTA."

Although the Majesty was the first, and thus gave its name to the new subclass of destroyer, it would not be the last - even before the formal announcement of the Jovian Coalition of its new toy, it was suspected by many that not only had the Jovians begun work on other destroyers, but also the various other powers had started building their own new destroyers as well.

Worryingly for the GTA, the Majesty marked the change in the rebel powers from 'civilian uprising' to actual independent governments on par with, if not superior to, the Alliance."

Rather than scrap these ships as newer models were built, the Earth Alliance modified the destroyers, fitting them with a second hangar bay to increase their fighter capacity, and replacing the traditional hull armor with the EA's heavier plating. We can also conclude that the EA built a number new ships of this class from scratch, as nine units of this type have been identified in battle so far.

More complex models can be configured for more advanced procedures, such as LTLD (Low Temperature Liquid Differentiation), allowing them to isolate dozens more rare gases from extremely dilute feed stock."

6935, "In the earliest days of interstellar travel, trade between systems was relatively limited by the simple expense of access, both to orbital and super-orbital space and to intersystem jump technology. As technology matured, however, and access to space became cheaper, commercial activity and interstellar trade grew rapidly, particularly as colonisation efforts – and later the 14 Year War – saw demand boom. Soon, the requirements of the ballooning trade network threatened to overwhelm the early Endymion class space stations of the time.

The Alliance’s response was two-fold. The first was the acceleration of the design and deployment of the earliest Arcadia class Installations in order to reduce the burden on existing Endymions in the largest populated system. The second was the development of the Veles, a smaller station and supply depot that could serve in a number of roles as a resupply depot, cargo or passenger transfer station or deep space storage facility in populated systems. Some were further adapted to provide refuelling capabilities or for maintenance and repair of the vessels they serviced.

Unlike the larger, more generalist Arcadia, the Veles demonstrates an almost spartan dedication to its role. Where an Arcadia can accommodate thousands, a Veles has an active crew of only a few hundred, and a maximum capacity of under a thousand people. Where an Arcadia has a cavernous fighterbay and was armed to defend itself during wartime, the Veles was very lightly armed (or in many cases entirely unarmed) and used its various landing bays primarily for shuttles, transports and small freighters rather than fighters. Despite these apparent shortcomings, the Veles was considered highly successful in its role, and the simple, robust design rapidly spread across Sol and the newly colonised systems of the GTA."

6993, "The various colonies are being evacuated as we speak. Wings of transports are being loaded with passengers and awaiting the order to scatter. When the Lucifer arrives, those transports will make a run for the Delta Serpentis node and for safety. This way, some lives will be saved.

But the evacuation isn't over yet, and there are still a lot of people down there on that blue planet of ours. And as pilots for the Galactic Terran Alliance's 1st Fleet, the finest and greatest of them all, you will do everything in your power to buy enough time to evacuate each and every one of those civilians."

6994, "Attacking the Lucifer is a suicide mission. Which is why every single one of you will die to a man to delay that superdestroyer for as long as possible. Do I make myself clear?

Let's just hope the Bastion comes through this time."

However, the destruction of the Lucifer in subspace had some... adverse effects on the node. Attempts to send news of the Bastion's task force's success mysteriously failed. Investigation into this revealed the Sol-Delta Serpentis jump node to have completely collapsed.

Sol has been cut off from the rest of the Galactic Terran Alliance.

However, we have other, bigger problems. The interference of the Crown, the Typhoon and the Cirrus - all civilian craft - in a military operation, and actually firing on military craft...

If this is true, and the planets are shrugging off the Alliance and acting independently... then the Great War will be nothing compared to the carnage we shall soon see."

Excellent flying there, pilot."

Shortly afterwards, the Jovian colony declared itself independent of the GTA and renounced the treaties and agreements that bound it to the Galactic Terran Alliance.

The 'Jovian Coalition' are to be considered traitors by all GTA personnel, but also a military force to be reckoned with. These aren't just a bunch of pirates - the Jovian colony, like all the others, maintained a separate fleet once. It's only a matter of time before they build it up again."

7296, "It is believed that several of the other planets are on the verge of open rebellion as well. One other power has been sighted - the Uranian-Neptunian Union - but nobody apart from the Jovians have declared their independence.

This rebellion must be crushed swiftly, pilots. The GTA cannot be allowed to collapse. Order throughout Sol must be maintained. As the only remnants of the GTA known to still exist, we must preserve the Alliance at all costs."

This version uses photon acceleration technology to achieve the same effect - a good light cannon that is equally effective against shields and hull plating.  As this weapon was planned for production throughout the Solar system it is likely that our enemies may make use of these new weapons as well."

Despite our many strikes against them, the Jovians still outnumber us greatly, and we haven't even started on the other planets yet.

Only a handful of cruisers remain, and they are tied up with important defence assignments. Our offensive power - hell, our defensive as well - has effectively been neutered.

One destroyer cannot stand against a fleet. Thanks to your gross incompetence today, the very security of the Galactic Terran Alliance has been compromised. So, you are hereby discharged from service, to prevent you from doing any further damage. Dismissed."

7361, "Ignore everything else - just get those bombers. Leo and Virgo target the Szczerbiec and the Praxiteles first, so get to them first and shoot those bombs down."

The attack on Jupiter has been postponed indefinitely.

Mars, along with Venus and Mercury, must be fully under GTA control before we can even think of taking on the Jovian Coalition again."

The Jovian attack is rather disconcerting. It indicates a level of strategic thinking in the Jovian Coalition that surpasses our initial estimates. They are certainly better thinkers than the Martians, who simply wanted to destroy the Terra. All this is a moot point, however, thanks to your timely intervention in their little scheme.

Conversely, the actual opening of fire between Martian and Jovian forces shows that the rebels are not unified in their efforts. This could be extremely useful to us - not only will the rebel fleets' efforts be hindered by their rivals, but also these divides can be exploited by us to ensure our survival."

7421, "The Terra is well on the way back home and the pursuing Martian cruisers pulled off a while ago, so she should be safe. We'll get repairs done on her as soon as possible, but don't expect the Terra to be fully operational any time soon.

Other attacks on the Venusian fleet have gone off without a hitch, leaving their navy in a sorry state of affairs. However, while we would normally push ahead with our advantage here and attack their HQ, reports from the Martian front have been somewhat discouraging. Facing both Martians and Jovians, our already paltry fleet is crumbling away under the pressure.

It seems that their attack was more than a mere scouting operation, such as those done by Jovian ships previously sighted around Mars or just an attempt to destroy the facility. This was part of a full-scale invasion of Mars by Jupiter. Normally we would celebrate, seeing as it appears one rebel power has just destroyed another, but Command suspects that the Jovian objective was not simple conquest. You and the rest of 1st Fleet will be briefed on the situation more fully when more information becomes available.

In the meantime, Command has called off all offensive operations on both the Martian and Venusian fronts. For the moment, Command wants us to take a breather while we wait and see what's going on on Mars."

Under orders from Jupiter, the Martian fleet is moving into position for a full-scale attack on Earth. We face several cruiser wings, numerous gunboats and multiple fighter and bomber squadrons.

Suffice to say, 1st Fleet must defend Earth. Against such overwhelming forces, our only comfort is that they have no destroyer to counter the Terra with. However, the Martians do probably have Harbinger bombs amongst their arsenal, which pose a credible threat to the destroyer."

7643, "The Alliance is nearly gone. We destroyed the Shivan Lucifer, discovered its weakness, followed it into subspace and destroyed the Destroyers. But in its death throes, it threw us a double vengeance - not only the destruction of the way out of Sol, trapping us here for all eternity, but also the fragmentation of our Alliance from within, the treachery of the greedy and power hungry.

Darkness blankets us. Only Earth and the lunar colonies remain loyal to us. We are all that stands between the Galactic Terran Alliance and domination by the Jovian Coalition. The Terra is our last beacon of hope. Ensure that it is not extinguished."

7644, "This is it. Our enemies converge on $g Earth just as the $r Shivans converged on $b Sol. This time, however, no ancient ruins are here to save us. Our lives, our freedom, must be fought for and won by ourselves, paid for with our own blood, toil and tears. We're going to have to fight our way out of this one."

All of our ships have taken damage in some way or form, and some are in critical shape. Our only real weapon is the $g Terra, and she won't stand against a prolonged assault by cruisers and bombers. Even so, she is our only hope."

7647, "Your orders, $g Alpha and $g Beta, are to ensure the $g Terra survives and that the attacking rebel fleet is destroyed. It's possible that if we can repel this assault, the rebels simply won't have the manpower to launch another attack, and some kind of peace treaty can be worked out.

Either way, if the $g Terra falls, $g Earth and the $g Alliance are done for."

7648, "Rebel Fleet"

7649, "You abandoned the Terra during the final fight for Earth. You betrayed not only the thousands on board that destroyer, but also your wingmen, Earth, and everything the Galactic Terran Alliance stands for.

Or stood for. The Terra was destroyed by the rebel assault. Nothing remains of either 1st Fleet or the GTA, and now Earth is firmly under the thumb of the Jovians.

Normally for deserting the field of battle you would be punished. But with the end of the Galactic Terran Alliance and the imminent execution of all its former staff, I don't really think there's much point."

7650, "Excellent news, pilots, excellent news to match an excellent performance!

Your flying out there ensured our victory and the Terra's survival. If the Terra had gone down, we would have been wide open to attack and the rebels would have been able to just walk in and conquer Earth. But you and the rest of 1st Fleet prevailed and destroyed the attacking rebel fleet.

Speaking of which... the rebel fleet was a rag-tag flotilla of the remaining Martian and Venusian cruisers. Our fleet may have been all but wiped out, but so has theirs. GTA representatives will be meeting up to discuss an armistice with the various rebel governments. Crippled as we all are, none of us are able to continue the fight, and so peace is our only option left.

But you don't have to worry about politics. Just relax and head on down back to Earth. You saved the world and the Alliance. You're a hero now. We all are."

7651, "The Terra was destroyed by the rebel attack force. Without the flagship of 1st Fleet - our only serious weapon against the rebels - the Galactic Terran Alliance is at an end. Rebel forces have already made landings on Earth and are beginning their subjugation of our planet.

For the past five years, we have been patrolling the area around Earth, ensuring its safety and protection from the rebel threat that flourishes in the rest of the Sol system. I myself have been fighting for the Alliance ever since Operation Thresher, back in the T-V War. Oh, my name's Admiral Johnson, for those of you who don't know already."

7740, "You all know our new leaders have been changing quite a few things around here, namely the scrapping of the GTD Terra and a few dramatic legislative reforms. However, Command has informed me that starting from today, 1st Fleet will be undergoing a massive overhaul, starting with the following..."

7741, "...namely, the GTD Tereus has finally been completed! Engineers have finished their tests and technicians are even now readying the new destroyer for combat.

For those of you who haven't been keeping up, the GTD Tereus is a brand new destroyer straight from the think-tanks of the GTA. Based on the old Orion design, the Tereus class boasts stronger weaponry and armour, and Command hopes that it will lead us to victory over the rebels!"

7742, "That said, our enemies have also not been idle in the time since or last conflict.  Our intelligence reveals that the Martian Republic have been constructing new  Skjoldr class gunships.  The Skjoldr was a small cruiser constructed by the GTA during the T-V war as a complement to the larger Fenris class.  The Martians have likely pressed the class back into service to rapidly grow their fleet strength.  We do not know in what way these ships have been armed or differ from their T-V war ancestors.  We are uncertain what types of fighters you may encounter, but be prepared for anything. "

7743, "Command has authorised us to go ahead with Operation Medusa's Gaze, a series of missions that should clear the air for us and will become the first combat deployment of the GTD Tereus. For those of you who have received messages about this upcoming operation, briefing will begin in fifteen minutes. The rest of you, it's business as usual. Dismissed."

7744, "Hello and welcome to $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze. You have been randomly selected to take part in the $g GTA's first offensive military operation in five years, ever since the near-annihilation of $g 1st $g Fleet and the signing of the $b GTA-Independents peace treaty in 2335."

7745, "A little background knowledge for you - the terms of the peace treaty confine all $g GTA craft to $g Earth and the area immediately around $g Earth. While the rebels have all of $b Sol to run around in, we are not allowed anywhere outside of the region between $r Mars and $r Venus, on pain of war once more."

7746, "To ensure that we kept our side of the bargain, $r Mars and $r Venus set up several border outposts to keep an eye on us. One such outpost, consisting of three Martian gunboats and a small cargo depot, will be the target of the first phase of $b Operation $b Medusa's $b Gaze.  At least one of these vessels appears to be mounted with a powerful radar system."

Get to your ships, pilots, and destroy this outpost utterly. "

7750, "Welcome back, pilot. Your first engagement was a success. This is good to hear - from what I hear from Command, we'll be needing lots of successes if Operation Medusa's Gaze is going to work.

Speaking of which, Command hasn't bothered to inform me what significance the destruction of that outpost has, but that's nothing new. Get used to it, pilot.

Those strange Apollos you encountered seem to be a new class of Martian manufactured fighter.  We have provisionally designated these ships as $quoteGTF Latona$quote.  They appear to be superior to the old type, but their exact characteristics are unknown.

The Republic of Mars has understandably reacted with outrage at the mysterious disappearance of one of their monitoring outposts, but since there's nothing official to directly link the GTA to the raid, there's nothing they can do.

And before you ask, Command does know it is endangering the previous administration's peace treaty with the rebels. I don't know what they're up to, but it'll probably be for the best anyway."

You had other, more important things to worry about at the time.  At least it seems that they could not provide the Republic of Mars with hard evidence of our involvement, or that the Martian government is not willing to escalate our attack into full scale war just yet."

The station we will be targeting is the $r RMR $r Scabbard. The cruisers are the $r Warrior, the $r Paladin and the $r Cavalier.  The $r Warrior is one of the new Martian Ethon class cruisers. The Ethon class is derived from the old Fenris class cruiser which has been lengthened by the installation of hull plugs, with a new auxiliary reactor and reworked engines."

7810, "RMr Scabbard"

7811, "Previous cruiser strikes have often resulted in heavy casualties, so we're trying a different approach with this mission. An old refueling ship of our own, the $g GTR $g Manna, will accompany you on this operation. This vessel will be operating solely on autopilot without any crew.

You will jump in near the $r Scabbard and destroy it and its escort. The $g Manna will take its place. You will then wait for the $r Warrior and the other cruisers to jump in and begin refueling."

7812, "GTSC Manna"

7813, "While their guard is down, you will surprise the cruisers by opening fire on them. As you will be flying $b Medusa bombers, $g Alpha, this should not take long. Once you have destroyed the station and the cruisers, you may return to base."

I've decided that maybe you aren't suited to a role on the front lines of any upcoming conflict, and reassigned you to escorting freighters on the Earth-Moon run. That shouldn't prove too difficult for you."

7819, "Move faster. Lock bombs on in advance. Go for the cruiser the furthest away from the rest of your wing. Attack their engines, using Stilettos if you must."

7820, "Excellent work, pilots. Our second strike against the Republic of Mars was successful and Command are well pleased.

Unlike the Republic of Mars, who have not responded well to the destruction of another of their stations and one of their cruiser wings as well. Strangely enough, Command does not appear to be worried about the threats of war coming from Mars.

They have called off any further attacks against Martian forces, however. But if they think that'll be enough to prevent a war with Mars, then they're mistaken.

Both myself and Command want you to remain on standby, just in case. In the meantime, I don't want you discussing any aspect of Operation Medusa's Gaze, or what little you've seen of it, with anyone - civilian OR soldier. Got it?"

7821, "Oh, and by the way, good job protecting the Manna. While the Manna is technically worthless, your defence of it indicates a willingness to defend GTA property that I think ought to be rewarded and encouraged, in case of an operation where such an approach might just save the day.

As far as I know, we still haven't fully recovered from the first war five years ago. $g Command had better have something up their sleeve..."

7874, "The first phase of Operation Medusa's Gaze has gone off without a hitch, thanks to you, pilot. Operation Medusa's Gaze was an elaborate bait-and-switch trap centred around our new Tereus destroyer and our lack of a real fleet. Command is hoping to use the weapons of fear and panic against the Martians, to counter their vast numerical superiority, and we think that the annihilation of one of their cruiser wings by an unknown, nigh-on invincible ship using strange new ack-ack cannons should do the job admirably.

We're about to begin the push for Mars, and the second war the Sol system has seen in five years. You've seen the Tereus in action on her first combat deployment - now you will serve aboard her during her first campaign. Dismissed."

7875, "The Martians managed to catch up and destroy our cruisers, resulting in the loss of two ships that the Alliance could not have afforded to lose. Thanks to your incompetence, Earth's position has been weakened and Operation Medusa's Gaze may be for naught. Get out of my sight."

A number of you will personally partake in the initial strikes against the Martians, thanks to your skill and determination shown in previous operations."

The Prometheus A retains the compatibility of the original while delivering a higher rate of damage at a greater projectile velocity. This weapon was until recently restricted to GTI pilots on specially authorized missions, but has now been cleared for mass production. Use it well."

7911, "Before we launch an assault on $r Mars, we must take out some key secondary installations in order to weaken the $r Martian forces.

7912, "The $r Romulus and $r Remus are asteroids towed from the 'Belt to Mars orbit to serve as installations in the early days of space colonisation, initially for mining and for a platform in between $r Mars itself and the rest of $b Sol. Now, they serve in a military function as a second command centre for the $r Republic.

Other attacks against various Martian positions have gone off without a hitch, thanks mainly to the Tereus. Without a decent number of cruisers, our sole destroyer has had to do most of the work herself - but her cutting edge technology and weaponry give her an advantage over the Martians that they cannot hope to match.

Take a break while you can, pilot. You'll be escorting the Tereus when she attacks the Martian Fortress installation and destroys the Republic of Mars once and for all."

Excellent job retaking Mars from the rebels, pilot. However, of some concern is the successful evacuation of the more important Republic government officials from Fortress station, along with a small contingent of cruisers and freighters.

Its very heavy hull damage can devastate most enemy strike craft once their shields are gone. The Warrior can consistently strike bombers, and is accurate against fighters when launched from a favourable angle.  A few salvos of Warriors are always bound to do damage.

You may not have known it, pilot, but you were taking part in the final battle to secure the inner colonies!

An overview: GTA forces attack Mercury. Two cruisers carrying their leaders escape our attack and flee for Venus. Command, expecting this, puts Operation Hermes into action, sending the first of our new corvettes, the GTCv Skotas, after them. Meanwhile, the Tereus, over in the Asteroid Belt, begins priming its engines.

The Skotas pursues the Mercurian cruisers up to Venus, whereupon the Venusian fleet, eager to save the behinds of their allies, jump in and engage the Skotas. We send in the Tereus, and crush the rebel fleet between our two warships.

This operation was planned out long before the attack on Mercury. Thankfully, the rebels played right into our hands. If they had died to a man, then the assault on Venus would have entailed attacking their cruisers in defended positions, meaning a more costly and more difficult war.

But now's the time to relax and celebrate! The inner colonies have been secured, all thanks to the Skotas, the Tereus, and you. Take some time off. The Alliance won't be needing you until we find the remnants of the Martian fleet."

That said, we did pay a terrible price. The Skotas played her role of bait to the hilt, and was destroyed as a result of that.

However, the brave sacrifice of her crew in order to make Venus ours will be celebrated for years to come.

Finally, Command has stated that we will not be lowering the level of alert, instead remaining in wartime mode for the indefinite future. This has come from the very highest echelons of the GTA, and is down to two very simple things. One, a resurgence in rebel activity could occur at any moment, and 1st Fleet must be ready and waiting - and second, with a rebel Orion destroyer running around, we can't afford to let our guard drop and the enemy in.

Piracy is at an all time high, so we'll be taking a look at this little problem and seeing what we can do about it. The Asteroid Belt has become a very dangerous place to be, these last few months - which causes us some major problems constructing our forward defence outposts."

They saw off the last of their attackers, but more pirates are likely to arrive in their place, and soon. You're the only wing we've got available right now - we'll try and divert reinforcements to you as soon as possible.

The reasons for the attack on the Justice are unknown, but our motivations are crystal clear - defend that corvette at all costs! Now move!"

8366, "It is unfortunate that the Justice did not survive this engagement. The loss of a capital ship is a great blow to our morale and our fleet strength, especially when the ship is one of our oldest, and thus most iconic and experienced, corvettes.

Don't beat yourself up about it, pilot. You did the best you could. Now, I'm assigning you to guard duty on the inner side of the 'Belt. There are a number of cargo depots there that need watching, and I think you could benefit from the experience. Dismissed."

8367, "Attack Rogue, Plunderer and Sneak bomber wings before they can launch their bombs. Remember to assign Gamma to defend the Justice after the Lossow goes down, and to attack the Rohm after the Rohm arrives."

Again, due to the unusual nature of this attack, I've contacted EAI and informed them of what happened. So far, the current hypothesis is that the original exodus of petty criminals and enemies of the state - which happened just after the Earth Alliance's securing of the inner colonies in 2340 - also contained a number of radical anti-EA remnants of rebel governments, and it is these elements that are leading the attacks on our forces.

However, you don't need to concern yourself with that. A number of very important people were impressed by your performance today, pilot. Expect great things to be coming your way."

8414, "My name is Commissar Schlecht, and I am an officer for Earth Alliance Intelligence. We were impressed by your skillful defence of the EACv Justice from a heavy pirate attack, and have selected you and other top pilots for a top secret operation in the outer colonies. This briefing and anything you see, hear or do while working for EAI is and will be classified top secret, violation of which will result in your incarceration and execution."

8415, "The current major superpowers, apart from ourselves, are the Jovian Coalition and the United Saturnian States. These two planets have enough resources to easily counter our own fleet. The Jovians are known to have at least one modified Orion-class destroyer, the JCD Majesty, and the Saturnians are suspected to have one as well. If these two powers ever came together, they could easily dominate this system."

8416, "Thankfully, the two maintain a bitter rivalry. Two other powers remain, however - the Uranian-Neptunian Union and the Independent Plutonian Peoples. The main strength of the UNU is their technological superiority, this being due to their controlling the Neptunian science colony. Again thankfully, they have not turned their innovative prowess to military applications."

8417, "Finally, the Independent Plutonian Peoples - a pitiful excuse for a colony, their entire fleet consists of a few fighter wings and a single Ethon cruiser, the Styx. They continue to exist only on the sufferance of the other powers and by virtue of their weakness.
 
 Our plan is to use the IPP as a cover for a series of strikes against the UNU using old GTA fighter craft. Direct intervention in the area would bring the wrath of the Jovians and Saturnians down on our heads, so you must maintain your disguise during this operation. Disguised as Plutonians, you should be able to do a lot of damage to the UNU before they or the other powers crush the IPP, in which case our ruse will become unworkable. Even so, another power will be crushed and we will be one step closer to a unified Sol."

8418, "Welcome, pilots. Your first assignment as a crack-squad for the $g EAI will be the destruction of a $r UNU convoy returning from a trading mission to $r Saturn. Although the freighter caravan has a military escort - the $r UNC $r Ahab and two fighter wings - it is mostly made up of civilians.  One of the fighter wing is made up of the UNU's new interceptor, the UNF Alcaeus.  This craft appears to be a better armed and armoured Valkyrie.  The Ahab is a Vidar class cruiser -- a fast new ship intended primarily for convoy escort."

8422, "Your cowardice could have cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

8423, "Congratulations, pilot. You just completed your first Earth Alliance Intelligence mission - the execution of several hundred traitors, and if all goes to plan, many more will join them.

The Uranian-Neptunian Union is quite upset with the IPP over the horrific attack on 'innocent civilians' by Plutonian fighters. The IPP have denied everything - as they would if they really were the perpetrators of the incident. They are playing right into our hands."

After tolerating the brutal attacks of the 'Plutonians' on its ships for long enough, the UNU deployed their destroyer, the UND Tempest, to Tartarus station, and finally showed to the world the most impressive and well hidden weapon ever known to man. Flux beam weaponry.

The IPP has been annihilated. Pluto is, once again, a lifeless, uninhabited planet. The Tempest's new weapons gave the weakling Plutonians no chance at all.

This sudden development has halted the war we were about to have with the Jovians, thankfully. I was hoping to have my black operations pilots ready and waiting for this situation, but the way things have turned out... a war with the Jovians is not in our best interests right now, the balance of power not shifted enough in our favour.

Both the Alliance and the Jovians are marshalling their forces for a potential attack on Neptune, but I have other plans which will render such preparations useless. You have an hour, two at most, whereupon I want you to return for briefing immediately. Dismissed."

During a recent attack by the Jovians on EA space, the Neptunians took the opportunity to test a new weapon, the likes of which have only ever been seen on the SSD Lucifer - photon beam cannons.

If the Lucifer's flux weapons are anything to go by, these new weapons could prove to be that which gives the upper hand to the eventual victor of this conflict. We at EA Command are determined that the Earth Alliance will be those victors, and to do that, we must seize those beam cannons immediately.  The Jovian government is also expected to attempt to seize this technology for itself."

8631, "JOVIAN FLEET UPDATE
Observation of Jovian fleet assets in the previous engagement has allowed intel to provide the summary of their new combat vessels. The Antaeus is a Jovian fighter faster and more maneuverable than the Hercules but has only one secondary bank and so carries far fewer missiles. The Apollyon is an attempt to merge the capabilities of the Athena class with the ability bomber warheads. The Callisto is a new Jovian strike bomber falling in between in between the Apollyon and Medusa in its capabilities. The Hera is a large bomber with six gun mounts. It has a massive afterburner more than capable of doubling its speed. However it carries fewer bombs than the Ursa and it does not have a defensive turret.  Finally, the Jovians have introduced the Soter line of support cruisers. This class is armed with high velocity missile anti-ship missiles, nicknamed 'HVels', which appear to be derived from Jovian observation of our Skotas class. It has replaced the old Fenris and Leviathan cruiser lines in Jovian service."

8632, "The entire EA fleet has been mobilised for this operation. Your C.O.s will give you orders straight from High Command. Brand new Claymore Mark II heavy assault fighters are being shipped out to your vessels as they come off the production lines. Available for use with these heavy fighters is the latest in advanced weaponry - the EAW-162 Trantor cannon, the EAM-96 Penetrator anti-subsystem missile and the EAM-42A Stinger missile. Like the original Prometheus upon which it was based, the Trantor does tremendous damage to armor, although it does less well against heavy shielding. The Penetrator replaces the old Stiletto with a smaller weapon which can be carried in larger numbers for great effect against enemy turrets.  Lastly, the Stinger swarm missile improves greatly on the old Hornet and is absolutely lethal to fighters and bombers.
 
 Let nothing stand in your and the Earth Alliance's way. We must have those beam cannons!"

8633, "You've all read the Command Brief, you know what this is about. But while the $g EA fleet ties up the $r Jovians around $r Jupiter, $g EAI has another job for you.

You will be flying our new $b Claymore $b Mark II heavy assault fighters which have been brought out from $g Mars specially for this operation. Learn how to use them quickly - we haven't got the time for you to get used to how they handle."

8643, "The destruction of the Murphy has had consequences far beyond those that are readily apparent, pilot. It means not only the failure of this mission, but in fact the failure of years' worth of preparation and infiltration! YOUR inability to secure the beam cannon technology for EAI has done more than simply give our enemies an advantage we cannot afford to let them have - it has wasted the work of hundreds of operatives and strategists, work that has taken years to perform!

From the jaws of the lion itself we snatched the prize of beam weapon technology, and already the scientists on Earth are installing our own beam weapons on the Tereus. The information gathered from the Bohr will advance the cause of the Earth Alliance by years, even decades.

However, don't pat yourself on the back too hard, pilot. Events have conspired against us. The UNU still have their beam weaponry on the Tempest, and agents report that despite their armed attack on the colony, the Jovian Coalition and the United Saturnian States each received beam cannon prototypes from the UNU. We can only assume the rebels wish to form a unified front against the Alliance. Our dreams of complete technological superiority are not to be."

8647, "And yet, while this may seem somewhat meaningless in the light of the UNU's sharing of its technology, I would like to thank you for destroying Gemini transports carrying the Neptunian scientists. Without the prototypes and experts carried on those transports, the rebels will have a harder time making their beam weapons - which is obviously a gain for the Earth Alliance. Well done."

8648, "Worse still, the escape of Saturnian transports - while rendered somewhat meaningless in the light of the UNU's sharing of their technology - will allow the rebels to expedite production of the new beam cannons. If the transports had been destroyed, then several prototypes and scientists well versed in the production of these new weapons would not be around to help the rebel powers create their own beam cannons. As it is, the rebels now have a head start which we must work hard to catch up with."

8649, "Go straight for Gemini as soon as you enter the field of battle. Bring your wingmen with you, and target Gemini 1 first."

To those of you who were 'borrowed' by EAI, welcome back to the Tereus! You've arrived just in time to begin on a wonderful series of patrol and freighter escort missions! For the rest of you, it'll be business as usual. However, I do have a few announcements from EA Command."

8690, "Firstly, several new Tereus destroyers, starting with the EAD Arethusa, have been commissioned. The destroyers will take some of the heat off our backs, and will provide extra flexibility for the Earth Alliance, as well as add additional firepower to the fleet."

8691, "Secondly, our new beam cannon technology. Ever since the destruction of Tombaugh Station by the SSD Lucifer, Terran scientists have been trying to figure out just what makes the Lucifer's beam cannons tick. It appears that the Neptunian science colony cracked the puzzle, and thanks to a successful capture operation by some of our pilots, their findings are now available to the Earth Alliance! Our destroyers are currently being fitted with these new weapons as we speak."

8692, "Lastly, and while we're on the subject - a long, long time ago, the idea was had for a destroyer devoted purely to offence, a ship that could direct huge amounts of firepower in one direction that would ensure the destruction of whatever vessel it attacked. At the time, only laser turrets were available, and so the idea was scrapped. However, thanks to these new beam cannons, the idea has been resurrected, and a new class of destroyer will be completed in a matter of years - the EAD Lindos. Watch this space."

8693, "Expecting to go back to patrol duty, pilot? As I said, $g EAI has one more operation for you yet.

You may remember the attack on the $g Justice by pirate forces some time ago. The exact motivations for the pirate assault remain a mystery to us, although we have our suspicions. However, we wish to lift the fog before us, and you will be our lantern bearer."

8694, "EA"

8695, "A possible location where we might find out this information is one of the many pirate 'bases' scattered through the $b Asteroid $b Belt - however, they tend to be hidden well, and are typically guarded by a dense belt of mines.  Pirate ships are equipped with a device which deactivates those mines which are nearby to permit them to travel to and from their bases. Attempting to clear these mines would be costly and inefficient, and we cannot jump through the asteroids to the vicinity of a pirate base without a precise set of coordinates. Thus, we must use the pirates themselves to lead us through the minefields to their homes."

8696, "Macavity"

8697, "We have selected the $r Macavity, a pirate cruiser not particularly renowned for their competence, as the focus for this operation. $g EAI forces will attack the $r Macavity and cause her to flee. One of our operatives will then follow the $r Macavity through the $b Asteroid $b Belt and its minefields to one of the pirate bases.

You will be that operative."

8698, "You will follow the cruiser through the $b Asteroid $b Belt until the $r Macavity reaches a pirate base - at all times maintaining a distance of 500 metres to avoid detection. The $b Asteroid $b Belt will mask your engine signature, but a direct visual by the pirates will blow the operation. The Macavity disables any mine within 1000 meters of her.  You therefore must also not stray more than that distance away from her, either.  Once the $r Macavity has led you to the base, and you have made the correct subspace vector calculations, we will then deploy a task force to capture the base and discover more about these pirates. "

8699, "You have been assigned the Claymore Mk III for the operation.  This variant of the Claymore platform falls in between the original Claymore and Claymore Mark II in combat effectiveness.  It is equipped with an advanced sensor pod that will allow us to establish the best subspace vector for our task force should we need to display it. Remember, a visual sighting of the pirate base is not enough.  We need that subspace vector! We will keep you updated throughout the mission, pilot. Dismissed."

8700, "Your cowardice cost us the mission, pilot. A pilot for Earth Alliance Intelligence needs to be strong, brave, unflinching. With your desertion today, you showed yourself to possess none of those characteristics.

I'm almost sorry to inform you that regulations in EAI are a lot stricter than in the rest of the Alliance. You will be executed at 0600 hours tomorrow morning for treachery and endangering the security of the Alliance. Dismissed, pilot."

8701, "I'm not sure whether you picked this one up or not, pilot, but this was a STEALTH MISSION! Whether it was due to gross incompetence or outright treachery, I don't know, but you FOULED up the operation BIG TIME! I'll decide what to do with you later, now get out of my sight!"

8702, "Don't fire anything until the Macavity has led you to the pirate base. Don't get too close to anyone."

8703, "You were unable to keep up with the Macavity as it fled through the Asteroid Belt. This is most disappointing, pilot. I had expected you to be able to cope with a mission of this simplicity, but evidently you are not as competent as I originally thought.

A second attempt will be made in a few days - however, we will not be calling on you for the honour again. Our next meeting will be the one in which I decide your fate. Dismissed."

8704, "Don't let anyone scare you too far away from the Macavity. You have three axes to play in - use them well."

8705, "The destruction of the task force sent to destroy the pirate base is more than disappointing, pilot. If we cannot even destroy a rag-tag band of petty criminals, what hope do we have against the might of the Jovian navy?

The details of the mission have proved troubling to EA Command. Unfortunately, due to your handling of said mission, you are no longer cleared to hear exactly what that means. We'll discuss your failure and the consequences it shall have on your career later, pilot. For now, dismissed."

8706, "Virgo and Leo are top priority. Remember to assign Delta and Gamma to attack the Monarch and the Lambert before they can do too much damage to the Alexander."

8707, "This is most troubling, pilot. If the Jovians are in league with the pirates, as the presence of the Monarch seems to indicate, then we have a major political problem - not even considering the question of a powerful military force lurking in the depths of the Asteroid Belt, so very close to our homes on Mars and Earth.

I do not expect you to be concerned with such matters, however. You performed satisfactorily out in the field, successfully tailing the Macavity in a solo operation and then joining in on the attack on the pirate base. I am pleased, pilot. You have shown yourself to be a pilot worthy of EAI status.

EAI wishes to put this matter of the Jovian-pirate alliance on the back burner for a moment, and I wish to do the same with your career. Do not take it amiss, pilot - it is just that now is the time for spies and saboteurs, not for commando raids by the likes of yourself. And although the findings of today's little operation shall remain secret for the time being, your time here at EAI is not at an end.

We have numerous top-secret facilities that our pilots, while they are not serving our cause deep behind enemy lines, guard and keep top secret. You and your squad will be guarding such facilities, as until we require your services once again. Again, as with this Jovian matter, this may not rise up for some time - months, even years or decades. But it will do so eventually.

This is a great loss to us all - the Tereus was the flagship of the Earth Alliance and carried many fine pilots. Now that it has been destroyed, and with the EAD Heliades still under construction, our firepower has been greatly reduced. We will miss Admiral Werner greatly."

8807, "We are now the flagship of the Earth Alliance. The Arethusa will now take the place of the Tereus, and the EAD Resolute will take the Arethusa's place backing us. In the meantime, we are to sweep the Asteroid Belt for pirates and destroy them once and for all. The treacherous monsters will live to regret their attack on the Tereus!"

8808, "Our first task must be to locate the escape pods that launched from the $g Tereus. Reports from our forces guarding the $g Tereus shortly before her death said that nine escape pods managed to launch from the destroyer and get out into the $b Asteroid $b Belt. We must find those escape pods and bring them home."

8809, "The escape pods will be found in a radius of 4-5 kilometers around the wreckage of the $g Tereus. Confine your search to within this area.

When you do find the escape pods, you will escort them to the jump out point at the centre of the battlefield. If pirate raiders show up to pick over the remains of the $g Tereus, you may have to defend the pods against them.

Suit up, pilot. The $g EA needs you right now."

8810, "Your inability to defend ANY of the escape pods from the Tereus is a damning blow to the EA and your career, pilot. We are on the verge of fighting a massive war on multiple fronts, pilot, and we need all the men we can get. However, due to your incompetency, the surviving crew of the Tereus were massacred by pirate forces.

Think about how many people you let die today, pilot. You'll be doing a lot of thinking where you're going."

8811, "Engage the enemy as far away from the escape pods as possible."

8812, "You managed to save a number of the Tereus' escape pods. You did fairly well, for a rookie.

The death of the Tereus has rattled EA Command considerably. High Command has been in conference all night, and several commissars are getting quite excited. It is likely that we will be pursuing the pirate question with EAI assistance. As we are - now - the oldest and most experienced crew in the EA fleet, we will be the ones taking the murderous pirates head on. Be prepared for further action, pilots."

8813, "You could have saved more pods, pilot. Try distracting the enemy with yourself."

8888, "$g EA $g High $g Command itself has ordered the $g Lindos to sort out the pirate problem once and for all. With the aid of Commissar Reed from $g EAI, we have plotted out a two-part operation that should solve the problem handily.

We suspect the pirates maintain a central base of operations, an installation where they manufacture the weapons and ships that they use. While their outposts are easy to find, this pirate installation has evaded all attempts to find it - through sensor detection or by following pirates back to it."

8889, "The second phase of the operation will be concerned with destroying this installation. The first phase will involve discovering the location of the installation.

$g EAI has very generously donated us some prototype sensor systems that are capable of scanning individual subsystems in a small capital ship to a high degree of accuracy. We shall be using these new systems to discover the location of the pirate installation."

8890, "The cruiser $g EAC $g Lantern will attack one of the pirates' smuggling outposts, the $r Drexler. This attack should draw out various pirate cruisers on patrol in the area to defend the $r Drexler. Hopefully, one of these ships will have the co-ordinates for the pirate installation stored in their navigation systems.

$g Alpha $g 1 will be flying solo for this operation. You will escort the $g Lantern on the approach to the $r Drexler, so that the attacking force seems neither overwhelming nor pathetic.

A second task force has been selected for the second attempt at this operation... if it is still feasible, that is. You, in the meantime, will be assigned patrol duty and grunt work. Dismissed."

Yes, that's right, pilot. The 'Belt is now the front lines in a war that's been simmering away for over thirty years. EAI has confirmed the presence of Jovian ships at the pirate installation, showing that the Jovians were supplying and encouraging the pirate attacks on the Earth Alliance. The commissars have given the go-ahead for the EA to declare war against the Jovian Coalition in retaliation for the underhanded acts of aggression via their pirate proxies.

Our engineers have delivered a new weapon just in time for this new conflict - the EAW-62b Aratrum.  This is a close range shotgun type weapon that can chew up bombers and larger vessels with ease.

The $r Tempest is currently stationed at $r Atlantis station, waiting for our strike so it can respond with devastating force. In order to minimise the risk to our lone destroyer, $g Command has ordered that an initial wave of fighters and bombers be sent in to clear the way for the $g Lindos."

9062, "$g Alpha will fly bombers, $g Beta will cover them. You will both jump in at $r Atlantis station a few minutes before the $g Lindos does. $g Alpha, your objective is to destroy the $r Tempest's primary and port side beam cannons in order to make it defenceless against the $g Lindos' beams. $b Shriekers are available to you, but we recommend using $b Hellstorm bombs in their place due to their greater effectiveness."

9063, "The $g Lindos cannot wait forever, pilot - its current position is obvious to all and leaves it open to assault from $r UNU cruiser wings, so sooner or later it will have to jump in and attack the $r Tempest. Try and disarm the $r Tempest before that happens, pilot."

9064, "The ultimate goal of this operation, pilot, is the destruction of all $r UNU forces near $r Neptune. Whatever happens with the $g Lindos and the $r Tempest's main guns, your primary objectives are the destruction of the $r UNU's command ship, the $r Tempest, and the $r destruction of all $r UNU ships in the area.

Suit up, pilot. We're on a timer here."

9065, "The destruction of the Lindos is the defeat of our offensive. The UNU has survived our assault and is now ready to join the Jovians in a new attack on the Asteroid Belt.

Your failure is most disappointing, pilot. You will be brought up before a military tribunal in a few weeks, where you will be given your punishment. Expect, at the very least, expulsion from the ranks of the EA and imprisonment for several years for crimes of gross negligence. Dismissed."

9066, "You have to move quickly to disarm the Tempest's beams. Go for the ones facing the Lindos first, then tackle the rest. Also, when the cruisers attack the Lindos, the Harpoon cruiser is a priority target - take it out first, then go for the other ships."

9067, "A stunning victory for the Earth Alliance! This first strike bodes well for our offensive!

The destruction of the Atlantis has had two benefits - firstly, Neptune is no longer under UNU control. Secondly, with one full half of their union gone, the UNU has been seriously weakened and we are hoping for terms of surrender from the Uranians coming through over the next few days."

9068, "This development will hopefully negate the problem of the Tempest entirely, which escaped our attack and fled to Uranus. Thanks to your efforts, however, it is seriously weakened - replacing its destroyed beam cannons should take some time, hopefully more time than the UNU have available. Anyway, good job with that, pilot."

9069, "This development will hopefully negate the problem of the Tempest entirely, which escaped our attack and fled to Uranus. With its beam cannons still operational, the Tempest could prove to be a serious problem to our offensive if this surrender treaty does not come through."

9070, "If you had been able to destroy the Tempest's beams before it jumped out, then we would not have to worry about the Tempest at all."

9071, "You are also to be commended for your attempt to disable the Tempest so it could not flee the battlefield. Your foresight is impressive, pilot - if only the Tempest's commander had not caught on to what you were doing, then the Tempest would not be holed up in Uranus right now. A good show of initiative there, pilot."

9072, "Your attempt to immobilise the Tempest is to be commended, however. If the Tempest had not been able to flee the battlefield, then we would have been able to destroy her and strike a huge blow for the EA in the process. Good show of initiative there, pilot - keep it up."

9073, "You failed to destroy the Tempest's primary beam, pilot.  As a result we could not send in the Lindos and had to abandon the entire operation. With its beam cannons still operational, the Tempest will prove to be a serious problem to our offensive. Almost certainly this surrender treaty will not come through."

In the case of such a situation arising, orders will be issued to you by $g Command. You are being issued Penetrator anti-subsystem missiles in case any overzealous Uranian tries to start something.. Dismissed."

9111, "The escape of the Tempest has undone everything that we have been working towards on Neptune and Uranus, pilot. A carefully negotiated surrender, seeing the end of the UNU without putting any more EA personnel at risk - a boon beyond our wildest dreams - has been wasted, completely and utterly. The rebel warmongers have escaped to safety.

Twice now you have failed the Earth Alliance. Twice it was your task to destroy the Tempest, and twice the Tempest has escaped. Once, we could accept - but to fail a second time is too much. We shall ensure you do not fail the Earth Alliance again. You are being sent back to Earth, to be kept in one of EAI's high security detention centres. Your fate shall be decided later. Dismissed."

The war isn't quite over yet, though. Even though the EA greatly surpasses the Jovians and the Saturnians, the commissars suspect that the rebels will fight to the bitter end. They are convinced of their own superiority - and their pride shall be their downfall.

It must not be ours, however. The Jovians and Saturnians are still fully fledged powers, and the addition of refugee UNU ships, no matter how few, has only bolstered their ranks. If they manage to disrupt the momentum of our attack, we could be forced into the defensive, and it is a short step indeed between the defensive and the end. Stay sharp out there, pilot."

The Constant has already suffered damage in a previous engagement.  Be sure neither she nor the Eternity escape. Dismissed."

For your failure here today you are hereby dismissed from active service in the Earth Alliance pending a re-evaluation of your skills and abilities. Until then, you'll be spending your time back on Earth. Dismissed, pilot."

9166, "You need to take out both cruiser groups as quickly as possible - consider splitting your team up to take them both out. Also, you need only destroy the main beam cannon on each of the cruisers in order to save the destroyers - you can blow them up later."

Unfortunately, once again, the rebels have made their escape. The leaders of the USS fled to Jupiter on board the USD Eternity. There, they will reinforce the Jovian position.

This is This is regrettable, pilot, but at least we can claim a moral victory - the rebels are packing up and fleeing from their homes. The EA juggernaut of war is unstoppable, and the only hope for the rebs is to run away like the cowardly dogs they are. Soon, they will have nowhere to run to.

9281, "Your failure to destroy the Empress in time lead to the Lindos being pulled from the front line at a critical moment.  We lost the Resolute and her task force was scattered.  With the Imperial on the loose and the Resolute lost, the push on Jupiter has been postponed indefinitely. The Jovian Coalition has breathing space... for now.

However poor the circumstances of the EA are, they are nothing compared to your position. For your failure to perform your duty, and your possession of classified information to which you are not entitled, you are hereby condemned to death and shall be executed at 0700 hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed, traitor."

9282, "Stay close to the Empress and be sure to fire your targeting torpedoes as soon as they are ready."

9283, "Excellent job there, pilot. You narrowly averted what could have been a catastrophe for the Earth Alliance and turned it into a triumph, bagging one of the rebel destroyers in the bargain as well. Good work.  I'm sure that I do not need to mention that everything about this mission is classified.  It will be given out that Alpha took down the Empress with Hellstorms and with Terran fighter escort.

Everything is in place for the final attack. Considering this morning's performance, I've assigned you to perhaps the most prestigious and certainly most important role in the attack... you'll be informed of it later. Suffice to say, if all goes to plan, you'll be back home in time for tea and biscuits. Dismissed."

9320, "THE FOLLOWING IS CLASSIFIED AND STRICTLY FOR EARTH ALLIANCE PERSONNEL ONLY. REVEALING THE CONTENTS OF THIS BRIEF TO UNAUTHORISED CIVILIANS IS PUNISHABLE BY INCARCERATION AND EXECUTION FOR TREASON."

9321, "During the Terran-Vasudan War, multiple attempts to outclass the Vasudans were made. Various ideas were tried and discarded in a bid to gain the upper hand and destroy the enemy once and for all. One such idea was the 'Superdestroyer', a vessel much larger than the destroyer with the firepower of an entire fleet that could engage enemy destroyers on its own and survive. This idea was considered too expensive for a too unwieldy and ineffective weapon, and was promptly dismissed."

9322, "The Shivan superdestroyer Lucifer changed all that. Almost forty years ago, the SSD Lucifer massacred every single GTA and PVN ship that went up against it. The Lucifer proved that a superdestroyer could work."

9323, "With the reacquisition of Mars and the Asteroid Belt's resources and the end of the construction of a full and complete Earth Alliance fleet, work began on a Terran superdestroyer - a vessel that could counter the Lucifer, a vessel that could crush any destroyer in its path, a vessel that could take on an entire fleet and survive. And so, twenty years ago, work on the EASD Nemesis began."

9324, "The EASD Nemesis is capable of carrying over twenty full fighter and bomber wings. Its specially engineered hull is capable of withstanding not only heavy turret fire but also multiple massed beam attacks. It boasts fifty heavily armed, well protected turrets, thirteen of which are the best, most powerful beam cannons in existence. The Nemesis is the most powerful warship ever constructed."

9325, "We face enemies on all sides. Not only from Jupiter and the remnants of the Saturnian fleet, but also whatever lies beyond the Delta Serpentis jump node. The EASD Nemesis will guard us from our foes and ensure that our legacy survives for generations to come."

9326, "The campaign is nearly over. An attempted strike by the Jovian fleet was swiftly put down with the destruction of the JCD Empress. Only three destroyers remain - the JCD Majesty, the JCD Imperial and the USD Eternity. They and whatever are left of the rebels are no match for the Earth Alliance, not with the EASD Nemesis on station. With their destruction, the Sol system will finally be united once more, but this time under the rule of the Earth Alliance, and this time we shall never let go."

9327, "With the arrival of $g Nemesis from the shipyards on $g Mars, all is in place for the final battle of this war. The $g Lindos and the $g Resolute are preparing to assault the $r Io installations, the $g Freedom and $g Arethusa the $r Europa settlements and the $g Nadine and $g Yorktown the $r Ganymede cruiser detachments."

9328, "Nemesis"

9329, "The $g Nemesis, meanwhile, will strike at the very heart of the $r Jovian $r Coalition. The $r Imperial, the $r Eternity and the $r Majesty have all arrayed themselves around the $r JCI $r Throne installation, the rebel headquarters and their last hiding place. The $g Nemesis will be deployed against them."

9330, "Throne"

9331, "The rebel defences will be tough to breach, but we are confident that the $g Nemesis will weather the storm. As you will be escorting the $g Nemesis into firing position and defending it from the last-ditch rebel efforts to destroy it, then the glory, duty and responsibility for striking the last blow to finally end this long, long civil war... also rests on your shoulders. Succeed, and you will be a hero. Fail, and our wrath will know no boundaries. Is that understood?

Get to your ships, pilots. Victory awaits."

9332, "Your incompetence forced the Nemesis to be withdrawn, pilot. Thankfully, although a grievous blow to the EA, it has not completely negated our attack - unlike YOU, other forces have managed to capture several key Jovian positions, including Io, Callisto and Europa.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.
Dismissed."

9333, "Get the bombers quickly.  Peltasts will help."

9334, "Your incompetence allowed the Nemesis to be destroyed, pilot. Thankfully, although a grievous blow to the EA, it has not completely negated our attack - unlike YOU, other forces have managed to capture several key Jovian positions, including Io, Callisto and Europa.

A second assault on Throne installation will be made by a combined force of destroyers and other warships... you, however, will not be a part of it.

I simply cannot emphasise just how many people lost their lives when you allowed that superdestroyer to be destroyed, pilot. Your performance was not only unacceptable according to the standards of the Earth Alliance fleet - EA High Command itself has personally issued a warrant for your execution for gross negligence to the point of high treason. Popular opinion is vastly in favour of having you put to death immediately, but we here like to take things a little more slowly than that. Dismissed."

9335, "Bombs and bombers are always priority targets. Ditto beam cannons on the destroyers."

9336, "A truly inspiring performance there, pilot. You defended the Nemesis, flagship of the Earth Alliance fleet, from bomber attack, rebel destroyers AND a cunning trap, with no concern for your own survival, and thus ensured the victory of the EA over the last of the rebels. Tremendous job!

This is, of course, the end of the war. The only power in the Sol system now is the Earth Alliance - but we do not stand unchallenged. Rebellious undercurrents of society may seek to overturn and destroy all that we hold dear at any moment... plus, there is still the matter of whatever lurks in the shadows of Delta Serpentis...

The Shivans are still out there, pilot, and one day we shall have to face them.

But with the Nemesis on station, both fears of Shivan invasion and civilian rebellion can be allayed. Our new flagship - yes, the Lindos has finally been retired - will serve us well as the most powerful tool in the Earth Alliance arsenal.

In the meantime - congratulations! Your performance shall go down in the annals of history as something for future pilots to aspire to, and as part of the deciding factors in the EA's winning of this so very long civil war."

9394, "Nemesis, the Imperial has arrived to port!  The Jovians have you in a pincer!  All bombers, assist the Nemesis in destroying first the Eternity and then the Imperial."

9395, "Our fore starboard beam cannon has been destroyed!  Alpha, stop those bombers!"

9396, "A second starboard beam turret is offline.  Alpha we will not be able to continue the engagement if we keep losing turrets! We'll have to overcharge our remaining cannons!"

9397, "We've lost a third beam cannon.  Alpha, get on those bombers! "

9398, "We've lost all our starboard beam turrets. Command we need to withdraw the Nemesis!  This mission is a failure, All craft depart!"

9399, "Damage the Eternity with one salvo of bombs before moving on to the Imperial.  Our main beam turret can take care of a damaged destroyer easily enough."

9400, "Those new bombers that were orbiting the Majesty have jumped in to starboard!  They are attacking our beam cannons.  Alpha, take them out now!"

9401, "The Imperial is finished!  Now take down the Eternity!"

9403, "You thought we'd miss out on the end of the Jovians, did you?  All batteries open fire!"
