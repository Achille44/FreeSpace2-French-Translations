MSGXSTR "Akrami" 5488 "A massive energy burst was detected, powerful enough to cause shockwaves through hyperspace." 5511 "06a-04"

MSGXSTR "Akrami" 5488 "It is imperative we re-establish contact with the system and our fleet. The outcome of this war hinges on this." 5515 "06a-08"

MSGXSTR "FLEET COMMUNIQUE" 5326 "CAPTAIN RAMLY - FNS ARTEMIS, DURIUS SYSTEM" 5516
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "Admiral Akrami is deploying the Artemis to the Morik system for a recon mission." 5517 "06a-09"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "Though the Artemis is fully repaired and combat capable, we're going into this mission understrength." 5518 "06a-10"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "We still await personnel replenishment to bring our crew and pilot numbers back up to a full complement." 5519 "06a-11"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "Despite these setbacks, I know we're still more than capable of performing this mission." 5520 "06a-12"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "Deck crews will notice the new complement of Thunderbolt interceptors." 5521 "06a-13"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "Our mission parameters have changed. With the escalating conflict, we are progressing into an ASM-heavy combat environment." 5522 "06a-14"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "This is in contrast to the fighter-heavy combat of the Elam-Qahtadnan conflict." 5523 "06a-15"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "The journey to Morik will take several days. Updates will be forthcoming as soon as they're available." 5524 "06a-16"

MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5052 "GILES CAVILL - CAG" 5525
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5338 "Hey Ross. Looks like I'll be stuck in Durius Installation medbay for a while. The medics tell me I'm still on enforced sick leave." 5526 "06a-17"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5338 "I got a report from forensics after they dug through my bird - looks like a Combine shell tore through the air filter and gave me a dose of waste emissions before the safeties kicked in." 5527 "06a-18"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5338 "Anyway, I may grumble but I'm counting my lucky stars I'm still here. Doing better than a lot of other people." 5528 "06a-19"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5338 "Not making me any less impatient to be back in the cockpit. Don't get into too much trouble out there while I'm down, okay?" 5529 "06a-20"


MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5052 "MIMI 'PUNCHY' BERTONE" 5530
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5531 "Hi Razor. I'm leaving the Artemis and joining up with the Colossus fighter squadron. Everyone gets a goodbye note. This is yours." 5532 "06a-21"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5531 "We haven't really talked much but you seem like a good guy. You're an Alban like Raptor so you get bonus points." 5533 "06a-22"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5531 "Take care of Raptor while I'm gone, okay? You let anything happen to her, I'll come find you and kick your ass." 5534 "06a-23"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5531 "Ok Razor. I'll see you round." 5535 "06a-24"

MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "We have arrived in the midst of a debris field." 5537 "06a-26"

MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "This appears to be the result of a massive, temporary gravity well in close proximity to the planet." 5543 "06a-32"

MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5328 "We can confirm that this is a disaster of unprecedented scale, but the mission must go on." 5545 "06a-34"
