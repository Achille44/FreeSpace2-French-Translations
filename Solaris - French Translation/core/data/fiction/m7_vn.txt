MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Lieutenant, I've had the exec bring you into the Longview roster. Welcome to your new home." 7557 "07a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "There's much to do and little time to do it. Here's the situation." 7558 "07a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Ten days ago a major engagement took place at Bulwark which resulted in the destruction of Fifth Fleet, and the devastation of Bulwark's surface. We call this the 'cataclysm'." 7559 "07a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "I don't know how, but the Combine kicked us in the ass so hard that we're still feeling it days later. All reports suggest it was some sort of superweapon of immense power." 7560 "07a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "It was a god damn massacre, and Combine forces moved in straight after. Intel is sparse, but we know Admiral Lucja Romanowska and her command ship Imperatrix leads the Combine occupation." 7561 "07a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Anyway, there's hyperspace interference all through the system, making intersystem communications impossible. I've deployed couriers out to Shen Kuo, Akkad and Lincoln to establish contact with other Federation task groups. No reply as yet." 7562 "07a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Once help arrives, we can assault Romanowska and her superweapon and take back Morik from the Combine." 7563 "07a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "That all comes later. Right now I have a mission for you. Briefing is at 1330hrs." 7564 "07a-08"

MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Lieutenant Ross. Lieutenant McKearney. It's your time to shine." 7565 "07a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "I'm sending you to Juliet Base, the command centre for Federation Defense Intelligence on Bulwark. It's got something we need. Recon sweeps suggest that Juliet Base survived the cataclysm abandoned but intact." 7566 "07a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "A few weeks ago, your Artemis assaulted a Combine station in Mira, and a data cache was retrieved. That data is now in Juliet Base. We believe the Mira data contains crucial information related to the cataclysm weapon." 7567 "07a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Juliet just so happens to be a major storage depot for Fifth Fleet. A depot with supplies we desperately need." 7568 "07a-12"

MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "You'll be accompanying the transport Rocinante. She's been modified to carry interceptors and will serve as your launch point once she is on location." 7569 "07a-13"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "I'm sending the Uriel and Phoenix along. They'll be shuttling personnel to reactivate Juliet Base's automated systems." 7570 "07a-14"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Once on location, launch and sweep Juliet Base for hostiles. When the base is clear, the shuttles will dock." 7571 "07a-15"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Shuttle Uriel's mission is to restore power to the base energy grid. Once the Command centre is powered and online the Rocinante can spike the data network." 7572 "07a-16"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Shuttle Phoenix loaded with the rest of Longview's pilots will dock with the base hangars and identify any flight-ready craft to reinforce your air patrol." 7573 "07a-17"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Securing the Combine research data is the primary objective. Once that's done and the area is secure of hostiles, the rest of the flotilla can begin procurement of the supplies." 7574 "07a-18"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 7556 "Not to put too much pressure on you two, but this is our one and only chance to make this work. Good luck out there." 7575 "07a-19"

MSGXSTR "Murphy" 6552 "Ross, McKearney. Lieutenant Wade Murphy. CAG of what passes for the Longview's fighter wing." 7576 "07a-20"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 6552 "Lancaster will probably have my head over this, but you should know what you're getting into. Things are bad." 7577 "07a-21"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 6552 "Most of our pilot reserve was lost at Fifth Fleet HQ. We've been using conscripts and national servicemen in our combat wings. These are people used to flying logistics freighters." 7578 "07a-22"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 6552 "We're days away from running out of supplies and ammunition. Morale is rock bottom. We won't even last until reinforcements arrive. This is our last ditch effort to buy some time." 7579 "07a-23"
MSGXSTR "Murphy" 6552 "I've done what I can and scrounged together every pilot I could find. The rest is up to you. If you can pull this off, we'll probably be ok for a while. If not...well it was fun while it lasted." 7580 "07a-24"
