One of the most popular EFN fighters during the early stages of the Martian War, the Claymore was always well-rated for being easily customizable. BOD operatives from the Syndicate acquired the Claymore's technical readout, allowing the ORS to modify and manufacture Claymore fighters as an interceptor. While the Claymore was retired from service in the Federation fleet in favor of newer types of fighters, the Claymore remained widely used by both Syndicate frontline units and local Outer Rim security forces. The Syndicate was faced with new fightercraft design challenges in the wake of the Exodus from Sol and the Claymore was mostly replaced by much the cheaper Encantona as a result. The majority of the remaining Claymore-class fighters were refitted to create a new light bomber class – the ORB Krios – to replace Syndicate bomber losses during the Exodus from Sol.", 6105)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Amalthea Cruiser

The Amalthea-class cruiser is a heavily modified refit of the Leviathan-class cruiser and the only Syndicate cruiser still currently deployed in the Exodus Fleet. However, the Amalthea was originally a GTA design. The first Amalthea-class cruisers appeared in the GTA 1st Gaian Fleet shortly after the Great War by refitting older Leviathan-class cruisers with reinforced armor, a more powerful engine, and state-of-the-art weaponry. Several dozen more Leviathan-class cruisers were refitted into Amalthea-class cruisers during and shortly following the Secession War by the GTA and the EFN, respectively. However, the Amalthea quickly became obsolete when the ORS-EFN arms race after the Secession War resulted in a completely new generation of Federate cruisers replacing the EFN's Amalthea cruisers. Bamiyan Development Corporation then covertly acquired the Amalthea's blueprints through corporate espionage and used them as a template to retrofit the Amalthea for use by the ORS Navy. With a more powerful reactor, a small launch bay able to house a small contingent of repair drones, and modern weapon systems including three railgun batteries and two defensive missile launchers, the modified Amalthea fully met the requirements of an ORS fleet asset. These new Amalthea cruisers were first introduced in 2343 to complement the 2nd Jovian Fleet's remote outposts in the Asteroid Belt and around Jupiter's moons. Since then, they continuously served in ORS units. Though their production was discontinued in favor of the Vitalius-class frigates, Amalthea cruisers continued to serve in every ORS fleet until the Shivan Invasion. Several Amalthea-class cruisers played an important part in the Exodus from Sol and those that escaped the Sol system were subsequently assigned to the Escort Fleet.", 6165)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Vitalius Assault Frigate

A signature warship of the Outer Rim Syndicate, the Vitalius-class frigate was developed shortly after the end of the Secession War. Having endured a costly victory in the Secession War, the ORS had suffered heavy losses confronting the Federate Navy and was in desperate need of a new generation of warships to ensure its control of the Outer Rim. Seeking to help fulfil this need, Bamiyan Development Corporation designed the Vitalius-class frigate with versatility in mind. Without any shipyard able to construct ships longer than 1 km, High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, the supreme commander of the Syndicate Navy, requested a new warship class able to be constructed in the small shipyards spread throughout the Outer Rim. As the first ship since the end of Unification War classified as a frigate, the Vitalius wields firepower exceeding the old Orion class despite being only half its size. It has become a mainstay of the Syndicate fleet and was involved in every major military operation in all three stages of the Rim Conflict. A total of 258 Vitalius-class frigates were constructed in Syndicate shipyards and almost 150 survived to see the beginning of the Shivan Invasion of Sol. 

After the Exodus from Sol, the Vitalius became an integral part of the Exodus Fleet with its heavy rail cannons, Revenant torpedo launchers, and fast-recharging jump drive. Despite being equipped with intersystem jump drives, the Vitalius was designed to perform only short-range missions inside the Sol system. The small cargo space onboard places a limit on its operational range, making the Vitalius fully dependent on regular resupplies. The majority of the remaining Vitalius-class frigates were assigned to constantly escort Colony Fleet ships and even the Vitalius frigates forming the battle groups of the Roaming Fleet require logistical support to carry out military operations far away from the rest of the fleet. Although the Vitalius is equipped with a hangar bay able to house a single wing of four fighters, only 35% of the Vitalius-class frigates in the Exodus Fleet have a full fighter compliment onboard. Replenishing the fighter corps on destroyers and carriers is a higher priority, so many Vitalius frigates are forced to go without internal fighter support.", 6171)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Tychicus Heavy Escort Frigate

The crowning achievement of United Heavy Industries, the Tychicus-class heavy frigate was designed in 2349 as a more specialized complement to the versatile Vitalius. At that time, Syndicate Intelligence was intensively spying on EFN shipyards and factories. The Federation responded to the mass production of the Vitalius with new warship classes and new tactics. Therefore, a new heavy assault frigate was needed to confront the greatest EFN destroyers and carriers and assist ORS command centers which were located on Orion destroyers at that time. The Tychicus was designed to fulfill both roles and to fulfill them with deadly effectiveness. It shares a simple cheap spaceframe with the Vitalius, but this is where similarities end. The Tychicus is meant to be superior to all other frigates in every aspect. Its signature weapon is the Trinity System consisting of an Oculus Heavy Plasma Driver, an Archangel Ion Cannon and a next-gen Newton-BFR-21a Reactor to power both components. The Newton's efficiency vastly exceeded initial expectations with its huge power reserves, so the original project was complemented with deadly Revenant torpedo launchers and an advanced anti-bomber weapon known as the Ion Lance. An experimental target-sync software coordinates the fire of Ion Lances making them a nightmare for Federate fighter and bomber pilots. A simulation carried out in 2352 showed that with the Oculus piercing even the heaviest armor and the Archangel neutralizing subsystems and annihilating shields, a task force of three Tychicus frigates is capable of taking down a Lucifer-class superdestroyer and able to withstand multiple bomber runs at the same time. 

The few Tychicus frigates that survived the Shivan Invasion of Sol belong to the Heavy Fleet and are under the command of Fleetmaster Aasira Raji, ORD Anjaneya. Their primary objective is to assist the colony ships and protect them at any cost.", 6181)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Agneya Artillery Frigate

The newest Syndicate long range assault frigate has a history that dates back to the pre-Great War era. The Agneya was originally manufactured as an Explorer-class mining vessel at the beginning of Terran space exploration in 20XX and was redeployed in 2338 to collect minerals in the Outer Rim to satisfy the needs of the new GTA warship construction program. Following the events of the Secession War and the internal collapse of the GTA, many Agneya vessels were captured by Syndicate forces in the Outer Rim and re-used to supply its rapidly expanding fleets and flourishing industry during the years of economic boom. Their heyday lasted for more than two decades. The events of the Martian War resulted in the rapid development of the Hephaestus factory ships that combine mobility with high automation and the ability to extract minerals on the spot using mining drones. Although mostly relieved of their old duties, Agneyas were still used by mining and logistic companies without sufficient funds for a factory ship. They continuously played their small part as secondary mining vessels...until desperate times arrived and showed that old heavy miners might yet be of use. 

When the desperate ORS push to capture the Beta Volantis jump node failed and Shivan forces began to advance further into ORS and EFN space the Sol system, a bold plan was introduced to give the Syndicate a new unconventional weapon of destruction against the forthcoming Shivan armada. The thick heavy armor meant to sustain the rain of space rocks in dense asteroid fields had now to resist the rain of red lasers and beam cannons and a forward mining laser was hastely replaced with a colossial long-range variant of the standard Maul-class Heavy Rail Cannon. The Agneya became a symbol of its time - raw, unfinished, suffering from construction drawbacks and reactor overheating, but armed with monstrous death-dealing weaponry and was send to reinforce the crumbling lines of the ORS fleets against the overwhelming enemy. The Agneya is intended to perform long-range artillery strikes against Shivan warships while remaining out of their beam range. A couple of Agneyas with a proper fighter escort is capable of taking down a destroyer and its entire defensive complement on its own. However, the lack of proper anti-bomber armaments makes the frigate extremely vulnerable to bomber strikes and its subspace jumping capabilities are significantly reduced in comparison with the Vitalius and Tychicus frigates. 

Two dozen of the Agneyas were rearmed to take part in the defense of Sol and half of them survived the Exodus from Sol. Now they are used in crucial engagements to break Shivan formation or soften their defenses before the deployment of other warships.", 6185)

From all these new solutions, the Syr Darya carrier was born. 34 Syr Darya carriers were constructed and played a major part in numerous engagements reinforcing ORS warships and supply convoys with fighters while they remained far away from the war zone. During the Shivan invasion the Syndicate equipped the carriers with a pair of centerline mounted light rail cannons to enhance its escort capabilities and allow it to assist the refugee convoys. The few remaining carriers like the Graf Zeppelin or the Jarema became valuable assets in the Exodus Fleet due to their ability to dispatch fighter squadrons where necessary without the involvement of destroyers.", 6188)

The core warship of the old Galactic Terran Alliance, the mighty Orion-class destroyer was the most powerful Terran unit of its era. Orion-class destroyers played a significant role serving as the centerpieces of GTA fleets as well as heavy strike elements against Shivan warships. Seven Orion-class destroyers, including two under construction at the time, were trapped in the Sol system when the Sol-Delta Serpentis node collapsed. Later, three of remaining Orion-class destroyers – the GTD Ironclad, the GTD Lazarus and the GTD Apam Napatis – became the flagships of three fleets of the newly formed Outer Rim Syndicate. 

With only three heavy railguns, the Orion-class destroyers became mobile command centers rather than line destroyers and offensive operations were reassigned to the Vitalius-class frigates. The introduction of the Galahad-class destroyer demoted relegated the remaining Orions to the role of secondary heavy carrier. Obsolete construction forced the placement of railguns in positions which prevents the ship being able to focus all its firepower in one direction. Despite that, the Orion is still one of the most powerful ships in the ORS armada. A single destroyer of this class survived the Exodus from Sol – the ORD Ironclad, flagship of the Roaming Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Horatio Tyrone. Excluding the two Galahad-class destroyers, the Ironclad is the most powerful warship of the Syndicate Exodus Navy", 6195)

A huge joint project of Bamiyan Development Corporation, United Heavy Industries and Massive Dynamic and the ultimate response to anything that threatens the Syndicate's domination in space. The Galahad destroyer is the most powerful warship ever constructed in the Sol system. Classified as a destroyer, although significantly exceeding its standard parameters, this 3.1-kilometer-long behemoth is comparable with the SD Lucifer in terms of size, primary weapon configuration and fighting capabilities. High Fleetmaster Glenzmann, ORD Lazarus requested a new destroyer for the Syndicate after Valhalla Station was retrofitted with a next generation shipyard finally able to construct capital ships. The Galahad is designed to be the response for EFN's Praetor battlecarrier, to outmatch it in almost every aspect and match its legendary fighterbay capacity. The Galahad has everything it needs to be a mobile command center for an entire fleet. At the same time, it is a superheavy siege platform, intended to unleash hell on any Federate installation or stop any offensive on Syndicate worlds and crucial sectors. No single Galahad was ever destroyed by Federation forces, despite their numerous, ruthless and futile attempts. The first constructed warship of this class, the ORD Thor, under command of High Fleetmaster Christopher Glenzmann, became flagship of the 1st Jovian Fleet and the entire Outer Rim Syndicate Navy. It was destroyed in a desperate stand against an overwhelming Shivan armada laying siege to the ORS capital world of Europa. 

Despite being heavily influenced by the Orion destroyers, the Galahad has little in common with any Great War-era design. This superheavy warship is a monstrosity in terms of firepower, covered by almost impenetrable titanium reactive armor plating. The main tools of destruction wielded by the Galahad are rapid-firing Maul rail cannons including seven triple-barreled railgun batteries in a crown configuration supported by four Revenant torpedo tubes and four forward firing heavy Maul-B batteries for strike missions. The Anti-fighter screen of the Galahad is more than twice that of the Orion's. As a dedicated flagship class, it is equipped with a cavernous hangar bay housing up to 50 wings of fighters and bombers. The destroyer shares the reputation of almost the perfect warship along with the Tychicus-class heavy frigate, and despite extremely high production costs, the Syndicate constructed seven Galahad-class warships. 

The majority of these fearsome warships including the Thor itself were destroyed during the Shivan invasion. Two surviving Galahad-class destroyers – the ORD Demetrius, former flagship of the 2nd Jovian Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Hector Caliphtys, and the ORD Anjaneya, the flagship of the 4th Uranian Fleet commanded by Fleetmaster Aasira Raji, later formed the backbone of the Escort Fleet. The Demetrius and Anjaneya remain the most powerful warships in the Exodus Fleet and, along with the sole remaining retrofitted Orion class destroyer – the ORD Ironclad – they are the absolute centerpieces of every major operation against the Shivan threat after the Exodus from Sol.", 6200)

Outer Rim Syndicate - Nautilus Armored Heavy Hauler 


The Nautilus-class heavy haulers were designed as fast supply ships for frontline military vessels. After EFN bomber strikes destroyed several Syndicate light supply vessels, Alcopa Designs was contracted to create a large and heavily armored cargo ship to provide logistic support for ORS warships more effectively than the small and lightly armored Poseidon and Chronos freighters. The 700-meter-long Nautilus was the result. Equipped with 14 defensive turrets and heavy cruiser-grade armor to confront enemy fighter and bomber strikes, ships of this class had a surprisingly high survival rate during the Martian War as their heavy armor and armament allowed them to withstand strikes from EFN bombers. Very few Nautilus-class haulers survived the Shivan Invasion of Sol, but those that did later became mobile supply depots of the Exodus Fleet.", 6212)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Outer Rim Syndicate - Abraham Colony Ship

The history of the Abraham colony ship, originally designed as a heavy fleet carrier, dates back to the decisive moments of the final stage of the Rim Conflict. The Battle of Ceres resulted in tremendous damage being taken by the EFN fleet resulting in an opening for the ORS offensive of the Inner Rim. With Syndicate ground forces advancing on Mars and strike wings performing long range raids on Federate installations orbiting Earth itself, the Magistratorium and ORS High Command began to plan for further expansion after the Federation was defeated and Syndicate domination in Sol was complete. They requested a ship that would be center of operations for the entire Sol system and beyond if subspace connection with Delta Serpentis or any other system was established. This task was dedicated to joint consortium of Massive Dynamic, Bamiyan Development Corp and United Heavy Industries. The result was the Abraham supercarrier. 

Six supercarriers were under construction at the time when the Shivans invaded. After the Syndicate's attempt to stop the Shivan advance at the Beta Volantis jump node failed, Fleetmaster Caliphtys issued an order to secretly retrofit the Abrahams as colony ships - real floating cities and safe harbours for survivors from destroyed planets and space stations to evacuate as many surviving refugees as possible. The Syndicate's primary shipyards and unlimited resources from their orbital depots were assigned to this deadly race against the clock and managed to deliver three out of six colony ships before they were overrun. Ark-01 Abraham, Ark-02 Adrastus and Ark-06 Inquisitor -- later renamed the Spirit of Hope -- were then directed to the most densely populated ORS worlds with a simple goal - collect as many survivors as its cavernous hangar bays and numerous decks could accommodate. These vast numbers of people were later segregated according to their skills. Engineers, medics and other kinds of specialists were assigned to work on board the colony ship or other vessels while the rest of the refugees were put in hypersleep. 

With cavernous fighterbays, factory facilities and advanced combat information centers replaced with extensive hydroponics bays and numerous hibernation capsules, the Abraham-class carriers are now officially classified as colony ships and became the absolute centerpieces of the Syndicate Colony Fleet. Each contains 150,000-200,000 hibernation capsules and more than 30,000 active personnel. The Colony Ships colony ships provide 80% of the food and water supplies for the fleet, advanced medical help and a home for the majority of civilians living in the Colony Fleet. Despite the intensive efforts of shipyard personnel, none of the colony ships' retrofits was ever fully completed and many of their decks remain unused and without an atmosphere. Preparations to use these decks are carried out slowly as the colony ships are almost constantly on the move and under threat of Shivan attack. According to optimistic estimates it will take at least nine months to complete all planned retrofits and supply the entire fleet with sufficient amounts of food. As they are home to more than half of the Exodus Fleet's population, the colony ships constantly remain under the vigilant guard of Escort Fleet's autonomous unit - Heavy Fleet under the command of Fleetmaster Aasira Raji. 

The colony ship Spirit of Hope was selected as the political capital of the Exodus Fleet and the seat of the re-nominated Syndicate Magistratorium led by High Magistrate Muhammad Al-Zardari. The apocalypse did not make the Syndicate's political factions disappear and their interests and influences are concentrated here. The Upper upper decks are mostly occupied by the Magistratorium's administration and a team of scientists called Navigators who use a powerful cluster of quantum computers to select the path for the fleet chart the Exodus Fleet's course under the guidance of High Magistrate Al-Zardari. The Spirit of Hope has also become a cultural and scientific center, home to science labs, research centers, cinemas, theaters, seat of the corporations, churches and non-government organizations.", 6239)

The gargantuan Valhalla is one of the biggest installations in the Sol system, comparable only to the unique Earth G1 installation, the headquarters of the entire EFN military. Constructed in low orbit of Jupiter in 2246-2248 to oversee gas extraction carried out by the Jovian Collective Consortium, at the end of the 23rd century it became the seat of the Jovian government. The Unification War and the resulting formation of the Galactic Terran Alliance did not diminish its significance as it was selected to house the Jovian GTA governors office. 

Before the Delta Serpentis node collapse the station combined the roles of informal political center for Jupiter colonies and a huge freighter production facility. When tensions grew in the Outer Rim after the GTA enforced the execution of the Great Perseverance Plan, the Valhalla secretly began construction of a new insurgent fleet that would later confront the GTA armada in the Secession War. 

After the ORS' pyrrhic victory the Conglomerates of Jupiter offered Valhalla as the political capital of the Syndicate and primary seat of the newly-formed Magistratorium with High Magistrate Helena Smithsson contacting Conglomerate Lin Apis to begin negotiations. Two months later, the Valhalla was outfitted with the most advanced command facility in order to govern extensive Syndicate space and monitor the transit of both civilian and military spaceships. The Valhalla became the core of the Outer Rim Syndicate, home of its government and military headquarters. Before long ORS High Command started to refer to themselves as “Valhalla Command.” Before the Shivan invasion, the Valhalla was an almost self-sufficient city in space equipped with the largest shipyard in ORS-controlled space. 

The station itself has always been protected by heavy armor and designed to withstand the bombardment of enemy warships, but the Syndicate never decided to arm the Valhalla with strong defensive capabilities due to constant presence of the two most powerful ORS destroyers - ORD Thor and ORD Demetrius. When the Syndicate's ultimate victory seemed to be only a matter of time after the Battle of Ceres, High Fleetmaster Christopher Glenzmann ordered Gerace Corporation engineers to arm the station with numerous railgun batteries to provide the station with self-sufficient defenses and release its escort battlegroup escort battle group to participate in the forthcoming final assault on Earth. Retrofitting was cancelled during the Shivan Invasion and instead the Valhalla's railgun batteries were removed and placed on several surviving Orion-class destroyers to convert them into heavy assault warships. The station was successfully evacuated in 2367. The Syndicate government was later re-established on the colony ship ORCo Spirit of Hope while the Syndicate's High Command relocated to the Demetrius, Fleetmaster Caliphtys' flagship.", 6277)

This huge modular installation was designed at the beginning of Terran colonization of the Outer Rim, long before the formation of the Syndicate. It was intended to provide a living habitat for up to 700,000 residents but also serve as a logistics and trade center as well as a base for long range expeditions and mining operations. Sky Gardens were often the first Terran bases constructed in a newly colonized sector – initially lonely islands among the cold vastness of space – then eventually surrounded by a network of colonies, mines, refineries and supply depots. Because of their enormous logistical capacity, they usually remained political, trade and financial centers for the surrounding areas even after the majority of the population and industry moved to other space stations and planetary colonies. 

During the Martian War, Sky Garden installations were targets of EFN suicide attacks on their strategic spaceports and supply depots. The most infamous attack was the destruction of the ORI Heaven's Gate, a Sky Garden-class installation in high orbit over Neptune, in June 2351. Later, during the Shivan Invasion of Sol, the Sky Gardens became death traps for everyone aboard when they were attacked by Shivan warships. The ORI City of the Sun was the only Sky Garden installation to manage even a partial evacuation of its population to the ORCo Abraham before being destroyed by the Shivan juggernaut SJ Azazel.", 6281)

The Evangelist was designed in the early 2340s to combine the role of a small patrol carrier and a versatile cruiser suited for both atmospheric flights and recon missions in open space. Lightly armed and armored, this vessel was initially not intended to be a first line unit. However, during the EFN's preparations for the Martian War, an atmospheric craft was needed to provide a superiority role in low atmosphere, launch fighter and bomber strikes and even perform bombardments on its own. To accomplish this, the Evangelist cruisers had their compact hangar bay retrofitted to be capable of housing a full squadron of fighters instead of a single wing. These new cruisers were the backbone of EFN operations against the independent Martian provinces and ORS ground forces during Operation Iron Rain. Evangelists remained widely used and mass-produced after the Martian War when Mars was divided between the EFN and the ORS as the Federation needed to ensure its dominance above the Red Planet for future conflicts with the Syndicate. Evangelists remain the only known cruiser class to be able to house fighter squadrons.

Although the last Evangelists left the shipyard in 2362, many of them were once again retrofitted, this time with enhanced armor and additional anti-bomber weaponry as well as Scimitar long-range torpedoes. A pair of plasma cannons is the only part of the cruiser unchanged since its introduction. During Operation Mjolnir, Evangelist cruisers played a major role in the holding actions above Earth and Mars. Only a few Evangelist cruisers escaped the Shivan Invasion of Sol to join the Exodus.

A light frigate and mainstay of the Earth Federation fleet, the Solomon was heavily influenced by the ORS' famous Vitalius-class frigate. However, the Solomon is a significantly different design because of the way it uses its offensive potential. The Solomon relies heavily on its ventral VLS torpedo tubes, armed with long-range Scimitar swarm torpedoes - a weapon widely considered to be a nightmare when it comes toe-to-toe with Syndicate warships. Extremely fast and accurate with the ability to swarm its target, the Scimitar is much more successful than even the long-range variant of the Syndicate Revenant swarm torpedo. The first incarnation of the Solomon was intended to be a rapid strike vessel, equipped with Archangel Ion Cannons for striking against a target's electronics, point defenses and engines while using Scimitar torpedoes as its main assault weapon. Later variants were equipped with standard EFN burst plasma cannons to boost the frigate's effectiveness against armoured targets. The Archangel was dropped by the EFN military and later Massive Dynamic engineers modified the Archangel design creating a weaponry for the Tychicus. 

Solomon-class frigates remained the basic standard Federate frontline unit until the Shivan incursion, although since Admiral Walker's reforms in the early 2360s they began to play a long-range support role for the newly-introduced EFFg Vidar heavy frigate. Plasma cannons are considered underpowered by ORS tactical arbiters, but despite that, they should never be underestimated. Pilots are advised to avoid the longe-range Pulse Lances mounted on the Solomon's triple turrets. Destroying the ventral torpedo tubes is critical when Syndicate forces battle Solomon-class frigates. Don't get distracted by the main plasma driver of the Vidar, as the Scimitar torpedoes of the Solomon will destroy the main cannons of our warships much faster than any weapon of the Vidars.", 6318)

EFN heavy assault element, the Vidar is a next-generation vessel of the Federation armada armada and the most sophisticated warship ever designed by mankind. Justifiably considered to be an equivalent of the Tychicus-class escort frigate, the Vidar is longer, heavier, has a larger fighterbay but it's also considerably slower. The Vidar was also the first EFN battleship equipped with a heavier version of the plasma driver used frequently on almost every larger vessel in Federation fleets. The first version with the cannon mounted underneath the bow of the ship quickly proven itself to be too vulnerable to ORS Revenant torpedoes and supressing railgun fire. Later versions of the Vidar frigate had this cannon mounted inside the hull. 

Although heavy armoured, the Vidar was designed with versatility in mind. Its hangar bay allows it to perform a strike carrier role, but the strong forward arsenal is its signature capability. A cluster of Scimitar torpedo tubes, heavy plasma driver and a pair of secondary plasma cannons gives this vessel tremendous punch when attacking forward. Despite not being as devastating as the Tychicus' famous pair of heavy cannons, the Vidar must be considered as an opponent every bit as deadly as its Syndicate counterpart. Tactics used by the Federation Navy in the recent war featured Vidar-class warships used in shock-jump strikes influenced by the SD Lucifer during the Great War. The ORS lost several Vitalius frigates and Syr Darya carriers from shock-jump attacks. This EFN strategy, however, helped us better prepare for Shivan attacks during their invasion.", 6322)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Earth Federated Nations - Praetor Battlecarrier

The biggest and most powerful warship in the Earth Federated Nations, the Praetor battlecarrier has been a mainstay of Federate fleets throughout two wars with the Syndicate. Designed and constructed by a combined effort of the Han-Roland Corporation, the Mesa Corporation and Triton Dynamics in 2345, the Praetor was intended to replace the GTD Orion by combining the roles of a mobile command center and a base for fighter and bomber squadrons. By the outbreak of the Martian War Praetors had already become a key part of the EFN fleet and played a crucial part in Federate attacks against the Outer Rim. Their position as a second-line command center remained unchallenged until the Federation's end. 

More than 3 klicks in length, this fearsome vessel houses hundreds of fighters and bombers in its cavernous hangar bays. A single Praetor battlecarrier could launch and coordinate dozens of fighter and bomber raids simultaneously thanks to next-generation scanners and communication systems. It is a dedicated advanced command facility and operates mostly behind the front lines commanding battlegroups battle groups of heavy cruisers and frigates against ORS forces. However, should the situation demand it, the Praetor can enter combat itself and strike a deadly blow with its 16 heavy plasma cannon batteries. 

12 Praetors in total were in service when the ORS launched an offensive on the Inner Rim. Three of them - the EFCa Septimus, the EFCa Hadrianus and the EFCa Praetorian were destroyed at the Battle of Ceres while a fourth, the EFCa Executor, was destroyed during the assault on Earth. A further five – the EFCa Potemkin, the EFCa Cromwell, the EFCa Dortmunde, the EFCa Gideon and Admiral Rossendarch's flagship the EFCa Sovereign – have never been heard from since Rossendarch's failed counter-offensive on the Outer Rim. Both the ORS and EFN have declared Rossendarch's forces MIA. The remaining Praetors, including Admiral Walker's flagship EFCa Tiberius, tried to delay the bombardment of Earth and were annihilated by the Sathanas armada.", 6325)

Recently encountered, the Moloch is a vessel ORS tactical arbiters have had a problem classifying. This frigate-sized vessel is equipped with a large fighterbay and uses it in every battle it participates in, but with four beam cannons, the Moloch was classified as a light frigate rather than carrier. Despite these advantages, the Moloch poses a much smaller threat to our frigates than an Armaros or a Lilith. We think about the Moloch as a small carrier, escort ship or just second line vessel in Shivan armada. The centerline beam cannon of the Moloch is a serious threat, but as Shivan warships may differ between each other, only 75% of Moloch frigates utilize beams, while the other 25% have anti-fighter plasma cannons instead. Additionally, initial scans of the Moloch have shown a large, skeletal internal structure linked to the beam cannon. This fact led our analysts to the theory that the Moloch was retrofitted numerous times through its history and this beam cannon of the Moloch was once some kind of long range plasma weapon probably developed for artillery strikes or maybe even planetary bombardment, and was used to wipe out some space-faring races many millennia ago. Shivan Juggernauts have demonstrated planet bombardment ability during their invasion of Sol, so the Moloch was no longer needed in this role. 

During the close skirmishes, pilots are advised to avoid flak cannons of the Moloch. The frigate is not armed with anti-fighter beams and its beam cannons are not as powerful as the Daeva's and Armaros' beam cannons, so a precise strike by even a single heavy fighter wing can easily disarm a Moloch.", 6354)

This strange device appears to be a Shivan communication node. Encountered in several Shivan-held star systems, these nodes emit strange subspace signals and quantum pulses for no purpose that we can determine. The device itself has no stationary parts and an eight axis symetry. 

Accorting to the intel gathered by the BOD and Navigators onboard the Spirit of Hope, the Shivan communication network is based on the quantum phenomena known by humans as Entanglement. The information transmitted between Shivan warships seems to be operating on a quantum level, and occurs in real time. Every unit in any armada knows about state of each other without any time lag. This theory explains the perfect coordination found in the Shivan battlegroups during their invasion of Sol in 2367. 

The usage of quantum entanglement by Shivan forces is a still subject of debate for our tactical analysts. One of other theories is of the old and actually ancient concepts inspired by the hinduist Akasha Sphere, that treat the Shivan mentallity as a single organism bounded at the quantum level with unusual behaviors. The proposed idea of a Shivan network mentions a common information quantum disc with no single point of failure, but rather decentralized throughout the galaxy, similar to TerraNet used by the GTA, EFN and ORS, but on much greater scale. In a difference to its Terran counterpart, the Shivans would use quantum pulses of pure energy instead of encoding information in a binary form. This way every piece of information ever gathered by the Shivans would be recoverable no matter when, where, and who wants to recover it. Navigators onboard the Spirit of Hope are working on devices that will let us intercept information from the Shivan network based on ETAK device developed by the GTI. If this theory is actually true, we believe it will, sooner or later, lead us to a great advantages over the Shivan pursuit and help avoiding Shivan-infested systems in the near future.

Given that we can only speculate about how Shivan communication actually works, the purpose of the Kali devices remains unknown. Nonetheless, pilots are instructed to destroy these comm nodes at every opportunity since any disruption of Shivan communication can only help our war effort. As with Rahu gas miners, anyone attacking a Kali should proceed with caution, however, as these volatile devices create a massive explosion when destroyed.", 6362)

Probably a smaller and more versatile version of our old Pluto gas miners, the Rahu was first encountered with the Shivan armada that invaded the Sol system. The only available intel available for this class of vessels came from quick scans by our reconnaissance units. Despite being smaller than the Pluto, the Rahu seems to be much more effective at extracting deuterium from gas giants or perhaps even raw nebular gas and refining it into fuel for their ships. Rahu gas miners should be treated as an absolute priority for Roaming Fleet forces since every opportunity to harm Shivan supply lines should be taken to disrupt the pursuit of the Tyrant's armada. Even so, pilots should exercise extreme care when attacking Rahu miners as these ships are likely to explode violently when destroyed.", 6423)

The Qadesh is a vessel unique in the entire history of human space exploration, a true product of desperate times requiring an unconventional approach. During the Martian War, the Earth Federated Nations' military invaded the Outer Rim with full force and introduced an aggresive bombardment strategy commenced by both bomber raids and capital ships. The Syndicate turned out to be unprepared for EFN forces targeting planets and orbital installations on such a scale and the first weeks of fightings brought disastrous damage done to ORS industry and its production potential drastically diminished. In order to turn the tide ORS High Command introduced a plan to make the most vulnerable elements of industry independent from planets and their closest neighbourhood. With long and devastating warfare on Mars, the Outer Rim mobile shipyards and factories turned out to be the factor that led to the Syndicate's victory. 

The Qadesh is fully capable of producing ships up to frigate size and performing repairs of ships up to destroyer configuration even in combat conditions. It has an optimal crew of 2,000, but routine repairs can be performed with only 500 crewmembers. Only one mobile shipyard – the ORSh Big Buddha – survived the Shivan Invasion of Sol. From the outset of the Exodus from Sol it has always had the arduous job of repairing Syndicate warships damaged in engagements with the Shivans. There is a popular saying among the Big Buddha's engineers that 'if three days go by where we haven't had to repair a Roaming Fleet frigate, the Exodus Fleet is either safe or completely fucked.'", 6653)

+Tech Description: XSTR("Earth Federated Nations - Talos Destroyer

An advanced destroyer concept and one of the most high-tech vessels ever produced by mankind, the formidable Talos-class destroyer was introduced as a part of Admiral Donathan Walker's military reforms in 2361. The Federation designed this warship with a single purpose – to confront and eliminate Galahad-class destroyers. Still reliant on Praetor battlecarriers, the EFN fleet suffered from a lack of offensive potential, and while the Vidar-class frigates were always formidable opponents for the numerous Syndicate frigates, the Gaian Fleet lacked heavier units designed with versatility in mind. While physically smaller than the Galahad, the Talos has similar firepower. Though it is armed with a few plasma cannons, the main advantage of the Talos is its numerous torpedo clusters. This destroyer was designed to swarm its target with countless Scimitar torpedoes, effectively rendering the majority of the Galahads railgun batteries inoperable. 

The Talos is not only excellently armed, but like every large Federation warship, it has a large fighter and bomber complement. The Talos is equipped with three hangar bays containing a total complement of up to 180 fighters and bombers. Large squadrons of Cronus and Lyre bombers often support the Talos during strike operations, extending its already tremendous anti-warship offensive push. Talos destroyers use a form of improvised shock-jump tactics inspired by the Lucifer superdestroyer and swarm their targets with countless torpedo launches and bomber strikes. However, the Talos pays the price for this effectiveness with relatively light armor, high maintenance costs, and a constant need to resupply the destroyer with additional torpedoes. 

Talos-class vessels were never numerous. A lack of advanced command facilities and utility prevents the Talos from taking on a flagship role, leading to the Talos-class destroyers serving in strike elements. As a result, warships of this class were mostly commanded by commodores or rear-admirals. Notable examples of this class include the Iapetus, the Ascendant, the Augustus and the only one that survived the Shivan invasion – the EFD Redemption under the command of Rear Admiral Victor Leibniz. Restoring torpedo arsenals was the biggest problem that severely limited the Redemption's effectiveness against Shivan vessels and relegated the flagship of the EFN remnant to the role of assault carrier. Fortunately, by the time the Exodus Fleet left Cor Caroli, the Redemption was outfitted with an antimatter converter and automated torpedo assemblers.", 6657)
