MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5007 "KATHERINE LAU - HOSHIKUZU" 5036
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "All right everyone. I've got some huge news." 5175 "17a-01"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "It's official. Navo, Master Badami and I have joined forces. The Hoshikuzu, Pollux Arrow, Nassau and Hopewell now fly together as a team." 5176 "17a-02"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Considering we've previously worked closely with Navo and his marines, as well as Kaur working with the Hopewell's deck crew, this is probably all just a natural evolution of our relationship." 5177 "17a-03"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "As part of the merge, Badami and Navo have agreed to give us access to their finances." 5178 "17a-04"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "I've used a portion of our funds to refurbish the Hoshikuzu. The work will be done at Vicare station. With the Hopewell also being converted to a carrier, our group will be using almost all of Vicare's total yard capacity." 5179 "17a-05"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The Hoshi's going to be a whole new ship at the end of the refurbishment. Her drone bay and fighter maintenance facilities are being replaced with an ASM launcher." 5180 "17a-06"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "This is a massive investment which I hope will pay off in the end. She's finally getting some teeth to match her lion's heart." 5181 "17a-07"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "This means Ross and Meiks are moving out. The gunships will be transferred to the Hopewell's fighterbay along with both pilots. I'm sure you'll all be sad to see them go." 5182 "17a-08"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "However, both Meiks and Ross will remain under my employment as part of the Hoshi's official roster. I'm not letting you two get away that easily." 5183 "17a-09"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Got a surprise for you Ross. I had some leftover funds after the Hoshi's refurbishment so I went shopping at Vicare." 5184 "17a-10"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "The Hopewell is the proud home of two Tor bombers that I got for a bargain, along with a supply of Jackhammer anti-ship missiles. They'll make up the Hopewell's heavy strike wing." 5185 "17a-11"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "I want us to take one out for a test drive. We'll also use the opportunity to try out the Jackhammers." 5186 "17a-12"

MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "You, Meiks and I are taking a shuttle out to the Hopewell. From there we'll launch from the hangar and start the weapons test. I've got a test site set up in the nearby scrap field." 5187 "17a-13"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "Obviously the Tor bomber is a lot heavier than your Comet gunship and even more sluggish. Today I want you to get a feel for how it flies in case you need to use it in the future." 5188 "17a-14"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5071 "This is like Christmas all over again! Ok Ross, let's grab Meiks and get to the Hopewell." 5189 "17a-15"
