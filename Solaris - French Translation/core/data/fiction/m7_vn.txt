MSGXSTR "FLEET COMMUNIQUE" 5263 "CAPTAIN LANCASTER- FNS LONGVIEW, MORIK SYSTEM" 5491
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Lieutenant, I've had the exec bring you into the Longview roster. You should now have system access." 5493 "07a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "There is much to do and little time to do it. The following is a summary of events." 5494 "07a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Five days ago a major engagement took place at Bulwark which resulted in the utter destruction of Fifth Fleet, and the devastation of Bulwark's surface. We call this the Cataclysm." 5495 "07a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "The Combine deployed a weapons platform never before encountered. All reports suggest it was some sort of superweapon of immense power." 5496 "07a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Two hours after the cataclysm, Combine forces moved into Morik from Actium and seized strategic assets throughout the system. Admiral Lucja Romanowska and her command ship Imperatrix leads the Combine occupation, but we have no intel on her location." 5497 "07a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Morik is saturated with hyperspace interference, making intersystem communications impossible. I've had to deploy couriers out to Shen Kuo, Akkad and Lincoln to establish contact with other Federation task groups." 5498 "07a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Once reinforcements arrive from these systems we can assault Romanowska and her superweapon, and take back Morik from the Combine." 5499 "07a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "That all comes later. For now I have a mission for you. Briefing is at 1330hrs." 5500 "07a-08"

MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Lieutenant Ross. Lieutenant McKearney. Thank you for coming." 5501 "07a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Our target is Juliet Base, the command centre for Federation Defense Intelligence on Bulwark. Recon sweeps suggest that Juliet Base survived the Cataclysm abandoned but intact." 5502 "07a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "Juliet holds the Mira data retrieved by the Sycorax and is also a major storage depot for Fifth Fleet. We believe the Mira data contains crucial information related to the Cataclysm weapon." 5503 "07a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lancaster" 5492 "The storage depot also has supplies we desperately need." 5504 "07a-12"
