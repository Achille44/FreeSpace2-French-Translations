MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "Lieutenant Ross. I hear your group was responsible for getting us out of Sulsia alive. Thank you. The Crown is grateful for your efforts." 5286 "19a-01"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "The loss of the Elgin was tragic but our embassy in Sulsia managed to evacuate with minimal casualties." 5287 "19a-02"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "This attack on Commonwealth citizens wasn't a random Malikan raid. I'm afraid I must take partial responsibility." 5288 "19a-03"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "Well-armed and well-resourced groups are after me, and unfortunately Commonwealth citizens were caught in the crossfire. When one can't find one's target, carpet bomb the ground around them and to hell with collateral damage." 5289 "19a-04"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "I've come into information that certain powerful high-ups don't want released. Something to do with the Malikans' newfound capacity for war. As bad as the Sulsians are at keeping their own territory secure, they're not entirely to blame." 5290 "19a-05"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "I was sent to find out who was supplying Andri Gadaria with weapons. The Malikans are a pawn in a greater game. We're now starting to find out who the players are." 5291 "19a-06"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "The Crown may have need of your services soon. You can play at being mercenaries for a little while longer but don't drag your feet when Fleet calls. You still have your oath." 5292 "19a-07"
MSGXSTR "OPAL CROSS" 5285 "One more thing. The next time you two want to announce your Commonwealth credentials in public why don't you tight beam Admiral Romanowska into the conversation. Just for completion." 5293 "19a-08"

MSGXSTR "Navo" 3872 "Covenant isn't a system or a planet. It's a hyperspace capable habitat that's a hub for transports, freighters and refinery ships all in service with the Children of Renewal." 5297 "19a-12"
