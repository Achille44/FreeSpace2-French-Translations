4807, "Standard Terran Issue
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Power Usage"

4808, "Argon laser weapon - uses transparent ceramic technology in order to create an optical system that is extremely durable and stable under battle conditions - provides adequate destructive damage to the hull of enemy ships by vaporizing molecular bonds at the target area and destabilizing molecular bonds across the grain of the hull material.

The GTA issues ML-16 Lasers to every fighter and bomber in service."

4809, "GTW-41 Disruptor Cannon"

4810, "Standard issue
Low Hull Damage
High Subsystem Damage
Tactical Weapon"

4811, "A gas-focused krypton laser - when the ship is in flight, the chamber of the GTW-41 rotates at a constant speed - a small amount of NO2 is injected into the container .05 ms prior to the emission of the laser light - the rotation of the NO2 in the chamber focuses the laser pulse to a state that is only very slightly (1%) diffused - after the laser pulse is emitted from the chamber into space, the chamber expels the NO2 into space (thus expelling ionized molecules and moisture) - the process repeats for each subsequent burst of laser energy - as this laser is very slightly diffused, it is not effective as a destructive weapon, but as a tactical weapon - the Disruptor Cannon is best suited and is used for the permanent disabling of enemy ship subsystems.

The Disruptor Cannon should be utilized in all capture operations in order to minimize risk of target's destruction."

4812, "GTW-15 Avenger Cannon"

4813, "Special Issue
Moderate Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage
Projectile Weapon"

4814, "A rapid-fire, computer-controlled radar and gun system - capable of firing at a rate of more than 4500 rounds per minute - used primarily for close-defense situations - uses closed-loop radar technology to locate, identify, and direct a stream of highly destructive 45mm projectiles to the target.

With the advent of shield technology, the Avenger is preferred over the ML-16 in any ship that can carry it.  Its extra damage against hulls make it one of the best anti cruiser weapons.  It has also proven very effective against Vasudan fighters.  However, its substandard anti-shield capabilities make it a poor choice for dogfighting Shivans, although far better than the ML-16."

4815, "GTW-32 Flail Rifle"

4816, "Special Issue
Low Hull Damage
High Shield Damage
Kinetic Weapon"

4817, "A rapid-fire, low energy, ceramic optic focused, krypton laser - used in tactical situations to distract or lead an enemy to their destruction at the hands of other allied fighters - this weapon, if used over an extended period of in-flight battle, can destroy an enemy fighter, but, as a destructive weapon, should only be used as a last resort.

The fast firing rate and high mass of the Flail make it great for changing the velocity vector of an enemy fighter or bomber.  It is slightly more effective than the Avenger against shields, rated at damage/second.  Its low energy consumption rate makes it useful for prolonged engagements.  Note, however, that once you have taken out an enemy's shields, switching to another weapon is advised."

4818, "GTW-5 Prometheus Cannon"

4819, "Prototype
High Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage
High Energy Usage"

4820, "Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.

The Prometheus works best against target hulls.  Against shields, it only achieves mediocre performance.  Its slow speed and high energy consumption work against it as well.  However, the primary advantage of the Prometheus is that it can be equipped on almost any fighter in the GTA."

4821, "GTW-7 Banshee"

4822, "Special Issue
Moderate Hull Damage
High Shield Damage
High Energy Usage"

4823, "An electromagnetic weapon - sends rapid pulses of exceptionally strong electromagnetic energy resulting in a 1.63 x 10^5 J blast that forces its way through any known shield technology and produces a dramatic shearing effect which quickly destroys the target ship's materials - named for the fact that in an atmosphere, the pulse creates an atmospheric disturbance similar to a quasi-human scream at 180 dB - uses up a tremendous amount of available ship energy - already, it is has been used by many GTA fighter aces and test pilots as a coup de grace, although such a use for this massively powerful offensive weapon is officially viewed as poor sportsmanship by the GTA.

The Banshee's impressive anti-shielding capabilities make it the weapon of choice against the Shivans.  The main limitation of this weapon is low weapons compatibility."

4824, "GTW-43 Leech Cannon"

4825, "Tactical Weapon
Low Hull Damage
Low Shield Damage
Drains Energy"

4826, "The Leech Cannon depletes the power supply of enemy fighters.  Use it to disable afterburners, energy weapons, and shields.  No subsystems targeting is required, just point and shoot.

The Leech Cannon is an anti-fighter weapon with minimal effect against larger vessels."

4827, "GTW-99 Shield Breaker"

4828, "Prototype
No Hull Damage
High Shield Damage
Moderate Energy Usage"

4829, "Developed as an anti-Shivan weapon, the Shield Breaker inflicts massive damage to enemy defensive systems.  This weapon causes no structural damage, but coupling it with an anti-hull cannon is very effective against larger Shivan bombers such as the Seraphim."

4830, "GTW-41x Advanced Disruptor"

4831, "Advanced Version
High Shield Damage
High Subsystem Damage
Tactical Weapon"

4832, "The Advanced Disruptor Cannon is much like the GTW-41 Disruptor.  However, its speed and higher subsystems damage make it much more useful in operations against faster moving targets."

4833, "GTW-65 Railgun"

4834, "Prototype
Moderate Hull Damage
Moderate Shield Damage
High Velocity Weapon"

4835, "A GTI prototype cannon, the Railgun was originally developed as an attempt to penetrate the shields of the Lucifer superdestroyer.  The weapon uses a series of electromagnets firing with millisecond precision to accelerate caseless uranium slugs at extreme velocity.  While its range, accuracy, and impact force are the highest in the Terran arsenal, shield damage is low and the weapon suffers from an extended recharge cycle.  Although the Railgun is technically a ballistic weapon, the slugs are extremely small, and for tactical purposes the quantity of ammunition is practically unlimited."

4836, "GTM MX-50"

4837, "Standard Issue
Heat Seeker
Moderate Damage
Fire and Forget"

4838, "Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel-based targets."

4839, "GTM-31 Disruptor Missile"

4840, "Advanced Prototype
Medium Target Lock
Tactical Missile
Disrupts Subsystems"

4841, "Advanced signal processing - high precision interception capability - small payload (9 Kt), combining both conventional explosives and a localized blast of energy caused by the effect of impact upon the laser-propulsion system of the missile - designed to temporarily disable subsystems on hostile targets.

The D-Missile is designed to temporarily stop a cruiser or destroyer from firing its laser turrets.  The effect will last about 10 seconds per missile fired, so using these to temporarily disable a cruiser should usually be for suppression until the cruiser is destroyed, or whatever was trying to evade the cruiser has gotten out of range.  Only a few ships can carry these - and they are very scarce - so proper utilization is important."

4842, "GTM-3 Fury Missile"

4843, "Standard Issue
Dumbfire
Low Damage
Maximum Compatibility"

4844, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - GTA fighters can carry more Fury missiles than conventional missiles, due to their small size - used for distraction and other tactical measures - very small payload (3 Kt).

Use is recommended in close combat situations and against larger targets where tracking is a non-issue."

4845, "GTM-9 Interceptor"

4846, "Standard Issue
Fast Target Lock
Moderate Damage
Dogfighting Missile"

4847, "All-aspect seeking - laser tracking senses energy reflected off a target from the primary weapon systems of the target, increasing single-pass kill probability - medium payload (18.5 Kt) - missile is designed to pierce reinforced hull, thus securing itself to the target, prior to detonating (15 ms delay).

This is the standard issue fighter killer in the GTA.  Designed to take out fighters with minimum hassle, a simple lock is all that is needed to grab the enemy's attention.  Short lock time, good speed, and decent payload makes this the best missile to use against all but the strongest ships.  Its effectiveness against large targets, however, is less than a typical laser run, making this primarily a ship-to-ship missile."

4848, "GTM Phoenix V"

4849, "Special Issue
Slow Target Lock
Heavy Damage
Anti-Bomber Missile"

4850, "All-aspect seeking - same tracking system as the Interceptor - large payload (50 Kt), but slower than the Interceptor - one of the best fire-and-forget missiles ever developed - many fighter pilots within the GTA regard the Phoenix V as the weapon of choice against high value, heavily defended targets.

The number one bomber killer in our arsenal, this is the single most damaging missile that can be equipped on a fighter craft.  The longer lock time and slower speed make it less of a dogfight weapon and more of an anti-bomber warhead.  Its extra damage against shields makes it especially useful against the Shivan bombers."

4851, "GTM-1 Synaptic Bomb"

4852, "Advanced Bomb
Area Effect
Moderate Damage
Fighter Suppression"

4853, "Missile propulsion unit carrying several small intelligent ''bomblets'' - when distance to target is less than 100 m or when time to impact is less than 2 sec., bomblets direct missile to the most vulnerable part of the ship of those parts of the ship facing the missile - bomblets then separate from missile propulsion unit and form a sphere - inertia continues to carry bomblets in the direction of the target - the missile propulsion unit continues to advance toward the target - when the missile hits the target or 1.5 sec.  after the missile should have hit the target, the bomblets explode - the spherical shape of the formation of the bomblets helps to ensure a fairly even level of damage across a sensitive area on the target - the spherical shape also ensures that the target will not be able to effectively maneuver away from the blast, thus ''pinning'' the target to a specific area in space - can also act as dumbfire - medium payload per bomblet (15 Kt) - very small payload for missile (2 Kt).

Nicknamed the ''Earthshaker'' by the bomber pilots who tested this, it is a bomber's best defense against fighters.  The Synaptic Bomb can do a lot of damage to a lot of ships at one time."

4854, "GTM-43 Stiletto"

4855, "Heat seeking - laser tracking similar to the Interceptor - missile is protected by a small shield system, allowing for greater success in payload delivery during busy melee situations and intense firefights - fast, but low in-flight maneuverability compared to other missiles of comparable size - low maneuverability due to the size of the missile's payload (60 Kt) and on-board shield system.

With the ability to take out most subsystems in one hit, and as simple to fire as an MX-50, the Stiletto is the best ship disabling bomb developed by the GTA.  Effective against turrets, engines and any other kind of subsystem, the Stiletto is a valuable asset to a bombers arsenal.  However, it's slow, unmanageable, and it can't do any real hull damage."

4856, "GTM-3 Tsunami Bomb"

4857, "Intelligent tracking similar to GTA targeting system - prior to launch, communicates with ship computer, gathering data about enemy target types and whereabouts - slow, low maneuverability - antimatter warhead (500 tonne mass-to-energy conversion) - due to instability of antimatter, no more than 10 may be carried on board a GTA bomber at any given time, unless pilot is granted a special permit by an appropriate governing body.

The Tsunami has now become the standard Terran bomb used to take out large targets.  Its short life requires that you get within 1500 meters of the target before sending it off, and since it needs a lock to be fired, it takes a brave pilot to fly straight enough for long enough to let one of these fly.  A few Tsunamis will take out almost any ship, barring a destroyer.  The antimatter warhead also washes over shields a little, so as long as it isn't too close to the center of the blast, a fighter or bomber has a good chance of surviving detonation."

4858, "GTM-N1 Harbinger Bomb"

4859, "Prototype
Requires Target Lock
Thermonuclear Warhead
Anti-Capital Ship Bomb"

4860, "Fusion bomb surrounded by 3 salted fission bombs - propulsion unit is a half-size version of a regulation GTA fighter thruster (Class II) - given the weight of the payloads, the missile is slow despite the power of the thruster - as the Harbinger is exceptionally large, GTA bombers are limited to carrying 6 of these weapons at any given time - the resultant shock wave from this weapon is potentially deadly, due to the size of the payloads (5000 Mt in total) - use near allied installations or allied ship groupings is strongly discouraged by the GTA - most effective when used in preemptive defensive strike against non-military installations.

The Harbinger is our best chance of destroying the Lucifer."

4861, "GTM-86 Cluster Bomb"

4862, "Standard Issue
Area Effect
High Damage
Cluster Warhead"

4863, "A second-generation Synaptic bomb, this GTI-developed cluster warhead has been designed for attacks against entire wings of enemy ships.

Upon reaching its target, the primary warhead fragments into multiple secondary warheads that explode within a split second.  The detonations produce a large field of blast field, making the cluster bomb most effective against fighter formations."

4864, "GTM-11 EM Pulse"

4865, "Advanced Missile
Area Effect
Fast Target Lock
Electromagnetic Pulse"

4866, "Upon impact, the EM Pulse temporarily disables the electronics systems of the target ship.  This renders the target ship unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock.  This has numerous tactical applications.  For example, a direct hit with an EM Pulse missile will prevent bombers from launching aspect-seeking warheads for several seconds.  Once the EMP field has worn off, they must also take the time to reacquire missile lock, granting you valuable time."

$b -GTD $b Ionia, $b 2nd $b Fleet
$b -July $b 16th, $b 2367

$b -Situation

For the attention of the officers and crew of the $f GTD $f Ionia$|, this is Admiral Ranov.

As you all have become aware, a catastrophic development has occurred within the nebular theatre of operations. At 1712 hours, while conducting a reconnaissance operation in a $h Shivan-controlled sector of the nebula, the $f GVD $f Psamtik was engaged and destroyed by a $h second $h Sathanas-class $h juggernaut$|. Since then, the Shivans have launched a massive, coordinated offensive against numerous allied positions throughout the nebula, utilizing a vast reserve of fresh and previously unaccounted warships. We have yet to determine the origin of these forces.

Two hours ago at 1835 hours, $y GTVA $y High $y Command issued an emergency order for all allied forces to withdraw to $b Capella where we will mount a defence against the Shivans. Admiral Petrarch and the $f GTD $f Aquitaine narrowly escaped to $b Gamma $b Draconis$|, and most of the $f 3rd $f Fleet have since pulled out from the nebula. 

In conjunction with Admiral Nekba of the $f 11th $f Vasudan $f Battlegroup$|, I have ordered the $f 2nd $f Fleet to cover the retreat of all allied units from the nebula. All warships short of critical damage are moving out to escort surviving elements of the $f 5th $f Fleet and $f 13th $f Battlegroup to the node while the $f GVD $f Memphis' battlegroup goes on the offensive to draw off as many Shivan forces as possible. The $f Ionia will be departing $b Gamma $b Draconis soon, and we expect to arrive in the nebula in just over an hour."

5146, "$b -Squadron $b Assignments

The $f Ionia will be going into general quarters as soon as we arrive in-system, with combat operations commencing immediately. Squadron assignments are as follow: the 9th, 180th and 301st will disperse to escort allied ships to the node and oversee the disassembling of our cargo depots. The 115th will be tasked with providing additional cover for the $f GVD $f Memphis as they attack a series of $h Shivan staging points. The 333rd and 509th are being deployed offensively to engage enemy targets along known Shivan logistical routes and stagger their push. The $g 78th will remain on standby to respond to any emergent situations. All other squadrons will launch in paired rotations and maintain security within the immediate space around the $f Ionia$|, which will reinforce the $f GVD $f Toeris and monitor the evacuation effort at the $b Gamma $b Draconis jump node."

5147, "$b -State $b of $b the $b Alliance

I will not lie to you. We stand on the precipice of a major $h Shivan invasion of our $y home $y systems$|. Each minute brings with it new reports of Shivan attacks against our frontlines, and the scale of the enemy offensive continues to grow. High Command is hastening the evacuation of $b Capella, but with such a large population in need of being relocated to neighbouring systems, it will take weeks before the evacuation can be completed. Shivan vanguard forces have already begun an incursion into $b Capella$|, attacking civilian convoys and rallying points in that system, all while harassing our forces as they withdraw through $b Gamma $b Draconis$|.

The consequences of our actions in these dark days ahead will be scrutinized by military historians for decades. It will be during these desperate times that all of us will learn to fight harder than we could have possibly imagined. Our finest hour is approaching.

It is my firm belief that the $f 2nd $f Fleet is home to the finest men and women in uniform of the $f GTVA$|. Remember this. Make your families proud."

5148, "$b{GTVA SECURE NET - 78 SQUADRON - VOICECOM
RECEIVED: 16$slash7$slash67 21:38:03 TST
FROM: Lt. Commander Erik Lawson
TO: 78th Silverbacks Personnel$}

Heads up. We're exiting subspace in twenty minutes. Chief, make sure our birds are ready by the time we get there. All pilots are to assemble in the briefing room before we exit the node."

5149, "All right $g Silverbacks$|, it hasn't even been fifteen minutes since our arrival from $b Gamma $b Draconis and we've already got several deployment orders. Let's get started.

Our first mission today is to investigate and reestablish contact with $f Supply $f Depot $f 11$|, a rear-line rearm-and-repair site under $f 3rd $f Fleet jurisdiction serving as a rallying point for allied convoys retreating from other parts of the nebula. Latest reports indicate that the depot's defence force had driven off several $h Shivan fighter wings before contact was lost. They missed their last scheduled check-in twenty minutes ago, and the reason for the depot going dark is unknown. Nebular activity is passive in that area, and the depot's squadron was still of sufficient strength to broadcast a warning if they had indeed fallen under attack again. Several freighters were also present in the area and more ships were either on approach or in subspace to this location. We need to know why none of these ships have reported back to Command.

Admiral Ranov has issued a temporary order for allied forces to avoid rallying at this location. In addition to serving as a vital route for our forces, the depot also contains critical supplies needed for our warships as well as a number of unoccupied craft. Needless to say, recovering these assets would help us out a lot.
"

5150, "Supply Depot 11"

5151, "$g Alpha wing, you're on point for this operation. Because we have no intel of what may have happened out there, you will be inserted several kilometers away from the depot and exercise a cautious approach towards it. If the $h Shivans are indeed responsible for this, they'll likely still be around. Command will assemble an SAR task force should this be the case.

Since this is our squadron's first foray into the nebula, I should remind you that visibility is going to be poor. You will need to rely on your radars just as you would rely on a wingmate, but don't expect to pick up much outside of four klicks. This lesson applies to the rest of you as well!"

5152, "Alpha"

5153, "If you engage hostile forces, Command will deploy reinforcements to your area. However, with dozens of other engagements occurring at this very moment elsewhere in the nebula, it may be some time before help arrives. Don't stray too far from each other, and you'll come home alive.

Watch your six out there, $g Alpha$|. Report to the flightdeck immediately -- you're launching in five. Beta wing, fall in for mission briefing..."

5154, "Panacea"

5155, "Reinforcements?"

5156, "Shivan forces?"

5157, "Welcome back to the Ionia, pilots. Thanks to your efforts, the GTM Panacea made it to the Gamma Draconis node and is currently en route to Capella. GTVA Command, the GTVA Medical Corps and Banov Medical representatives are pleased with the cover you provided. Well done.

Thanks to the Panacea's crew, we now have an idea of what happened to the depot. One of the defence force's pilots, likely under intense stress, claimed he saw a Shivan fighter near the depot's cargo platforms. This sent the crew aboard the GTFr Fencerton into a panic. The Fencerton had just docked with a munitions container which included a large stockpile of GTM-14 EMP missiles. The ship crashed into the depot's support beams, causing a detonation of the munitions and blanketing the area with enough EM interference to disable everything within a two kilometer radius. The explosion likely attracted Shivan attention, who would pick off the helpless pilots and most of the ships around the depot. The Panacea was far enough away to be unaffected by this, and went into hiding until they detected your wing's IFF signatures. Why the Shivans failed to completely destroy the depot remains unclear, but that doesn't matter.

Lambda wing, escorted by the 9th, arrived to secure the depot after your departure, driving off Shivan remnants after an intense dogfight. Although neutralizing all hostiles would have made their mission easier, it was outside our mission parameters.

Right now the depot is back under allied protection, and our convoys are once again passing through it. The GTC Kaluga is currently being towed out of the nebula, and 2nd Fleet's making the most of those supplies that were recovered. In the meantime, I suggest you get something to eat and return to the flight deck in 20 minutes. This war is far from over."

5158, "Destroying all hostiles would have left the Shivans at a disadvantage in the following mission."

5159, "Welcome back to the Ionia, pilots. Thanks to your efforts, the GTM Panacea made it to the Gamma Draconis node and is currently en route to Capella. GTVA Command, the GTVA Medical Corps and Banov Medical representatives are pleased with the cover you provided. Well done.

Excellent work in destroying all Shivan fighters and bombers in your AO. Recovering the cargo from that depot was made much easier thanks to your work.

5160, "Despite your efforts, the GTM Panacea was destroyed. Over 1400 souls were lost. A shadow of doubt will fall over our squadron going forward. 

The GTT Chariot, docked with the Panacea, was also destroyed. The Chariot's crew will be remembered for their bravery.

Dismissed."

5161, "The Nahema bombers are the primary threat to the Panacea. Destroying them should ensure the safety of Panacea."

5162, "Your wing failed to escort the GTT Chariot. Consequently, we were unable to sortie another recovery team fast enough before the Panacea fell to a heavy enemy attack. A shadow of doubt will be cast over our squadron for this.

Dismissed."

5164, "Despite your efforts, the GTM Panacea was destroyed. Over 1400 souls were lost. A shadow of doubt will fall over our squadron going forward. 

Dismissed."

5165, "You withdrew from the battlefield and left your wingmates behind. Because of this you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance. You will be interned to the Ionia's brig until we return to allied space. You are a disgrace to both the Alliance and to our squadron."

5361, "Understood, Alpha 2. Investigate the status of the depot. The evacuation is ramping up and time is of the essence. Command out."

5362, "Hey, shouldn't we be able to clearly see 'em on radar by now? I thought allied IFF's were configured to register their ID codes with nearby units. Nebular activity seems pretty calm too, so that can't be hindering us."

5363, "I wouldn't bet on that, three. The fog outside may just have the right composition of gases to screw with our stuff. This nebula's got a whole bag of tricks."

5364, "Most of which have only caused us trouble. Tell me again why we've got a repair yard out here in this soup? We sure as hell haven't tamed the wild west out here."

5365, "Alpha 1, it looks like we're entering a debris field. Watch your speed, team."

5366, "Lots of Terran debris. No way this is a few fighter wings worth..."

5367, "Woah..."

5368, "The whole place is trashed... Attention, this is Alpha 2 of the 78th Silverbacks, GTD Ionia. Is anyone reading me? I repeat, does anybody copy?"

5369, "I don't like this, Alpha lead. My instruments are picking up some residual EM interference. Maybe a flash storm caused this?"

5370, "Damn. Nothing but static. I'm calling this in. Keep your eyes open pilots."

5371, "Understood, Alpha 2. Can you get a scan of that freighter? There may be survivors on board."

5372, "Negative, Command. Alpha 3's picked up some residual EM around here. We're unable to acquire lock on any ship or cargo unit apart from our own craft."

5373, "What is the status of the GTC Kaluga? The cruiser had been deployed to this location to undergo field repairs."

5374, "I have eyes on the Kaluga, Command. She's still in dock and looks fine to me."

5375, "Alpha, try increasing the range of your transponders' frequencies. It is possible some vessels on approach to the depot may have fled and are out of contact range. Meanwhile our analysts will try to determine what happened out there."

5376, "Roger, Command. All right Alpha 1, lets increase transponder noise. If anyone's out there, let's just hope they can see our pings."

5377, "And now we wait. Keep your heads on a swivel."

5378, "Gods, this place is making my skin crawl. Desolate bases, ruined ships. The sooner we get back to Capella, the better."

5379, "I know what you mean, Skips. The Shivans could be watching us right now for all we know. Circling around us like sharks just beyond our radar range."

5380, "Not helping, man."

5381, "Sorry. In any case, we'll have a more level playing field without the nebula causing havoc on us. Once we bait them into Capella, the Colossus will clean the floor with this second juggernaut just like it did with the first one."

5382, "And then what? We thought we broke their backs after the last one, now they've got another one. The Colossus nearly burnt its guts to a crisp taking that thing down, now this?. You and I both know that this ain't the place to be building repair yards."

5383, "Our job isn't to $quoteknow$quote, Skips. Pilots like us have our hands full as is, we don't need that extra baggage. Neither me or Alpha 1 would've survived the Epsilon Pegasi front had we worried about Command's choices."

5384, "Damn, that just reminded me. Hasn't the Ionia been on the front lines for six months straight now? How the hell have you two manage to live this sort of life without a break?"

5385, "The secret is repetition, three. You only got here from Delta Serpentis a few weeks ago, but you'll get used to it. Good sleep cycles alone does wonders too. All that time you spend reading GalNet at night's not helping you though."

5386, "Well, I dunno about you guys, but I don't think there's anybody out there. I think Command has us chasing ghost ships."

5387, "Ah, ghost ships. Allow me to tell you the story of the Orcus-"

5388, "Good, data's compiled. Command, the signal has been identified as the GTM Panacea. She's dead in the water and her comms and radars are heavily damaged. Sending you both passive sensor and scan data now."

5389, "Excellent work finding that ship, Alpha wing. Hold your position and defend that vessel. We will sortie a recovery team as quickly as possible."

5390, "Command, we took down a Shivan fighter wing that was attacking the vessel. I don't know how long we'll be able to hold out if Shivan reinforcements arrive."

5391, "All allied reserves are currently engaged at the Gamma Draconis node. Epsilon wing from the 509th will be tasked to your location as soon as they complete their mission. You have your orders, pilots."

5392, "Roger that Command. Strap in guys, 'cause I don't think the Shivans will let us off so easily."

5393, "Hey wait a second. Look! Radar's picking up some friendly fuzz out at long-range!"

5394, "Yeah I see that too! Alpha 1, I recommend we investigate that signal. Someone out there's trying to get our attention. I have a hunch it won't be long before the Shivans pick up on it too."

5395, "Command, we're picking up a faint IFF that registers as friendly not too far from the depot. We're moving to investigate."

5398, "Okay team, you heard the man. Let's try and keep their paint intact."

5399, "These Dragons are hitting us hard, Alpha wing! I don't think we can take much more!"

5400, "Hull failure on the Chariot! It's down!"

5401, "Alpha we needed that transport to remain intact! No other transports are available at this time. We are aborting this mission. Return to base now!"

5402, "Damn it! We can't just leave them..."

5403, "Docking clamps secured. Handshake procedure complete. Boarding reports they are ready to proceed."

5404, "Pilots, the GTT Chariot has just entered subspace and is en route to your location. Be advised that Epsilon wing has been destroyed in their engagement zone. Beta wing from your squadron has been tasked to assist you, ETA three minutes."

5405, "Roger that Command. Sounds like everything's going to hell, right Alpha 1?"

5406, "I think we're already there, Charge..."

5407, "Jump flash! Four Dragons two klicks behind the Chariot! Don't let them get near that ship!"

5408, "Have your people be careful down there, Chariot. There's probably going to be a lot of scared people in there. No clue how they'll react to seeing your guys."

5409, "We'll tread carefully, Alpha 2. Airlock is opening. Boarding now. Stand by."

5410, "Beta wing is on station. Hope we didn't keep you guys waiting too long."

5411, "Waiting? Nah it's fine, Volley. We've only taken down...four, maybe five wings so far? The three of us could keep this up all day!"

5412, "Yeah yeah, I get it. Command sent us the deploy order while mid-op. If we keep pushing our fighters we'll toast our engines eventually."

5413, "We can see that. Hey, where's Sleet? Didn't the LC sortie him with your wing?"

5414, "He got jumped by Maras while we escorted a convoy at the node. His Myrm got pretty banged up but he managed to eject at the last second. He's been recovered by the Ionia. I swear he has nine lives."

5415, "Yeah, not the first time he's escaped death. Command brief you on the situation here?"

5416, "Yeah. Ghost depot. I see a transport docked with the Panacea. Have they fixed her up yet?"

5417, "No idea. Alpha 2 to Chariot, what's your SITREP?"

5418, "Sorry for the delay Alpha 2. Our team's made contact with the Panacea's captain. The ship's engines are currently undergoing field repair by our engineers, Should take us about five minutes to get them back online."

5419, "Oh my God! Those must have been bodies I saw earlier!"

5420, "..Understood. Do we know what happened out here?"

5421, "Details are sketchy so far. Some sort of explosion rocked the depot as the Panacea made its approach. It was strong enough to knock out several of her subsystems."

5422, "Guess we'll find out more during debrief. Thanks for the update, Chariot. We'll keep your people covered until we're back at the node."

5423, "Break time's over, guys. I've got angry red blips on sensors closing in fast!"

5424, "Looks like several wings. They're coming to clean house. Lock up that cover, pilots!"

5425, "Beta wing, watch for bombers trying to slip through! That medical frigate won't hold up long when under fire!"

5426, "Roger, one!"

5427, "Most of the crew and passengers are all right, though about a hundred people were lost to a hull breach in the lower level medical bays. "

5428, "Damn! Nahemas incoming! Knock 'em down before they can fire on the Pan!"

5429, "Bomber threat nullified. That was some fine shooting!"

5430, "Chariot, how long until that engine's back online? We're barely holding them back out here!"

5431, "Fusion drives are coming online and our warp drives are charging up! Our ETD is one minute!"

5432, "Warp drives are 100% charged! Pilots, stand clear as we enter subspace. Thank you for the cover, 78th."

5433, "Command, Alpha 3. The Panacea has cleared the area."

5434, "Excellent work Alpha and Beta. Relief forces will arrive to secure the area shortly. You may return to the Ionia. Command out."

5435, "All right Alpha, our birds have just about had it. We'll see you guys back at base."

5436, "Roger that. See you guys back home."

5437, "Shit! What was that?"

5438, "Skips?"

5439, "...It's nothing. Probably debris."

5440, "Hostile contacts approaching. Get set to engage!"

5441, "Well hot damn! Not even a scratch on that transport! Good shooting Alpha wing."

5442, "Pisces wing nullified. They gave that ship a beating. We're lucky we got here in time."

5443, "Alpha 1, close in and scan that medical frigate. It's best we package both passive and active sensor data for Command."

5444, "Lambda wing on station. We're moving to dock with disabled ships, Command. 9th Squadron, proceed with patrol pattern Omicron."

5445, "GTVA military doctrine calls for the application of continuous pressure against the Shivans. That includes forward bases capable of repairing warships. I think we've severely underestimated them though."

5446, "Hubris, Charge. And sooo much of it too."

5447, "Not going to argue you there, three. Anyway, let's get back on task. "

5448, "Wilco."

5449, "Command, Alpha 2. We've arrived at Supply Depot 11. We're negative on communication with friendly forces. Looks like a freighter struck the platforms' supporting structures. The depot's an absolute mess.
"

5450, "Uh oh. Looks like we've got hostile signatures near our friend. Step on it, Alpha!"

5451, "Dragons? Guess it was gonna happen sooner or later."

5460, "Shove it up your ass, Charge. Anyway, see you around."

5461, "Will do, Delta. Alpha 2 out."

The Allied evacuation from the nebula theatre is now in full swing. The $f GVD $f Toeris and the last of the $f 13th entered $b Gamma $b Draconis ten minutes ago, and $f 5th $f Fleet and the $f 6th $f Battlegroup will form the bulk of the next wave moving out. $h Shivan attacks are intensifying on our position, but our squadrons are pushing themselves to the limit to cover the beachhead around the node, and engineers aboard the $f Ionia are working around the clock to keep us in this fight. The $f GVD $f Memphis continues to harass Shivan staging grounds in an effort to buy time for our rallying points, but with more of our positions coming under attack, the $g 78th's being deployed to help relieve the pressure on our forces."

This group, led by the $y Moloch$| -class corvette $h SCv $h Leyak$|, has been an elusive pain to our fleets' proverbial ass since allied operations resumed in the nebula, and are responsible for the loss of multiple allied cruisers and fighter wings. The rest of this formation consists of the $y Rakshasa$| -class cruisers $h Gusion and $h Rofocal and the $y Cain cruiser $h Wendigo$|. Although these ships have yet to appear at any allied position since last contact, it is only a matter of time before they strike again. A plan has been crafted to draw them out into the open and eliminate them, thus allowing lagging allied units to make their runs for the node more safely.

Under Executive Order 21, the Admiral has released the following intel directly to our squadron. It is classified $y Level $y Psi$|, and any unauthorized disclosure of this information will be punishable under the $y Deneb $y Convention$|, $y section $y 21.3.5$|."

5477, "At 1704 hours, fighters wings from the $f GVD $f Psamtik made an astounding discovery: a second $y Knossos portal located deep within the nebula. Command had ordered the $f Psamtik to secure the portal and pave the way for an exploration of the region beyond. Due to the strong energy field exerted from the subspace portal, as well as a highly-charged nebular storm in the region, they were dropped out of subspace in a position vulnerable to the second $h Sathanas as it emerged from the device.

Although the $f Security $f Council's $y Office $y of $y Applied $y Research would love to get a closer look at this device, our strategic position hinders it. Instead we will conduct an assault on $h Shivan targets around the portal. The Shivan battlegroup was encountered relatively close to this location, and we hope an attack in this sector will draw a response from them."

5478, "$g Alpha and $f Beta wings, you will form the first attack group. Because of the aforementioned issues plaguing subspace vectoring to this location, Admiral Ranov sortied a $y Pegasus stealth fighter to drop a navigation buoy about five kilometers from the portal. This will help your wings exit subspace at a safe distance.

Before deploying the beacon, our scout reported that the $h Shivans had begun to set up a cargo depot not far from the portal, with transports, freighters and warships both entering and exiting at the portal. The depot is defended by around a dozen $h sentry $h guns and a wing of $y Manticore$| -class fighters. Engage these fighters first, as it's expected more Shivan fighters will jump into the area after you arrive. Once the area is clear, you may hit the depot before the next stage of the operation commences. It's not a primary objective, but denying the Shivans their supplies is always a sound idea."

The vessel you encountered was the SD Andromalius. This destroyer has been a menace to our forces in the nebula ever since we returned to it following the defeat of the first Sathanas. The Andromalius is now directly responsible for the destruction of eight of our warships during this conflict. Before arriving in your field of operation it had shock-jumped the GVD Amunet of the 6th Battlegroup, destroying a vessel that has seen combat since the Terran-Vasudan War and taking with it some of the most experienced officers in the Alliance. It is also responsible for the destruction of the GTCv Valiant and multiple convoys over the past six hours. Striking the Knossos was a risky move, but we can take solace in knowing that our distraction allowed for more of our forces to escape its wrath.

5642, "$quoteEmpire$quote. That sounds a bit presumptuous, right Skips? Even after thirty years we hardly know anything about them."

5643, "I guess, but just look at what they have. Juggernauts with the firepower of fleets. Destroyers that can hull one of our own in mere seconds. Planet killers! Swarms that can blot out our skies!"

5644, "The Shivans destroyed an empire that spanned galaxies thousands of years ago -- maybe other ones too. Surely they haven't been sitting around out here doing nothing for the past eight thousand years?"

5666, "Glad to have you and your big friends here, Gamma. This ought to get the Shivans attention."

5667, "Let's just hope the Sathanas doesn't show up. It's bad enough we lost the Psamtik -- let's make sure we keep these cruisers alive."

5668, "Command! Two Shivan cruisers designated Rofocal and Wendigo have just emerged from subspace. We could use those bombers right about now!"

5669, "Negative, Ascendant! We have just learned that the Leyak and Gusion have engaged one of our other units. The 333rd is being diverted to that engagement. You will have to take out those cruisers on your own. Command out."

5670, "Great. Command basically just told us to go screw ourselves."

5671, "Just like any other day I suppose. Come on, let's hit 'em hard and fast!"

5686, "Good."

5687, "A wing of Manticores have emerged from the portal. Don't let them get the better of you, pilots!"

5688, "Eyes up everyone! Two wings of bombers have warped in. Keep them away from the cruisers!"

5689, "I recommend we split up, Alpha 1. We can cover more ground that way."

5690, "Here come the escorts. We should try drawing them into our warships' killzones."

5691, "Bomber threat cleared. What's taking that hunter-killer pack so long? We're out here practically screaming at the top of lungs for their attention!"

5692, "All Taurvi bombers are destroyed."

5693, "Well, that sucks. One of the gas miners got away."

5697, "The SC Rofocal has been destroyed!"

5701, "Break! Break! We've got incoming from the Knossos! Demon-class destroyer!"

5702, "Pilots, keep away from that destroyer! We do not have the firepower to take down that warship!"

5703, "Command! Sortie the Memphis! We can't let another destroyer go open season on our fleets!"

5704, "Negative. The GVD Memphis is currently engaged and can not support your position. You have your orders!"

5705, "The Ashimmu's warping out of the area! Some blockade this has turned out to be!"

5706, "Your primary objective is luring out the Leyak's battlegroup, Alpha 3. The blockade is only a means to an end. We are advising all forces in theatre of this new threat. Command out."

5707, "All units, scouts report the SC Kumbhakarna may be inbound to your location and attempting to flee through the subspace portal. The cruiser has been heavily damaged. Intercept and destroy it before it makes the jump."

5708, "My sensors are picking up a Rakshasa-class cruiser exiting subspace. Looks like she took some good hits -- I'm picking up weak energy readings from its turrets."

5709, "Registering a clean kill on the Kumbhakarna. Excellent work guys!"

5710, "Ah hell. The Kumbhakarna has made the jump out of the nebula!"

5711, "Cut the chatter, pilots. The cruisers will be arriving momentarily. Stand by."

5712, "Ascendant, Khevtoth, can your sensors pick up any subspace activity heading our way?"

5713, "Negative, Beta. The ion storm's playing havoc on our sensors. You'll have to be ready to take down those beam cannons as soon as they exit subspace."

5714, "Copy that. We'll hit those beams, then let the bombers finish them off."

5717, "Alpha and Beta wings must escort a GTVI taskforce to the relative safety of the Gamma Draconis node."

5718, "$g Alpha$|, $f Beta$|, listen up. We don't have much time. 

As you know, our last operation didn't go exactly as planned. The $h Leyak and the $h Gusion attacked a convoy running a highly sensitive operation for $f GTVI$|. The squadron assigned to this unit has mostly been wiped out, and we're the only squadron that can get to them in time.

The convoy consists of two AWACS vessels; the $f GTA $f Almagest and the $f GVA $f Amun$|. The $f GVC $f Mesehti is attached to this unit providing warship support."

5721, "Almagest"

5722, "$f GTVI hasn't provided us with much to work with. All we know is that the convoy has since made an emergency jump towards the nearest allied surveyed region, $y Sector $y 103$|. Your mission is to escort them straight to the node, fighting back whatever the $h Shivans send your way.

Once you guys are off the deck, Ionia control will transmit the coordinates for the convoy. It's going to take at least two jumps to get there - three for the convoy to get back to the node."

5723, "Support during this operation is going to be limited, if non-existent. The $f Ionia's still covering the evacuation of allied forces through the node, and the $f Memphis continues to conduct an aggressive counter-attack against $h Shivan positions. All of our support ships are currently on the field rearming our squadrons elsewhere in the nebula, so you'll have to make do with whatever you bring. Allied Command wants our evacuation wrapped up within the hour.

Admiral Ranov specifically told me that $f GTVI needs those AWACS ships to return safely. Don't screw up. Good luck out there, pilots."

5724, "Welcome aboard the GVD Memphis, pilots. I am Lieutenant-Commander Nebet, GTVI's representative aboard this warship. Before losing contact with the GTVA, I was informed of your mission regarding two of our AWACS vessels, and I am most pleased that you were able to protect both ships from the relentless Shivan offensive. While I can not divulge the exact nature of the data they were carrying, I can say that it was immensely valuable for our analysts.

In addition to our convoy, you were also able to protect the GVC Mesehti, one of GTVI's prized cruisers. As you witnessed, the Mesehti is a test bed for photon beam weaponry on our Mentu-class cruisers, and houses modified version of the twin Akheton N21e reactors that power these vessels. We will need all the firepower we can get our hands on if we are to return to Capella.

For preserving all three vessels, you have been awarded with the Allied Defense Citation.

Before I depart, I have learned that the three of you will be temporarily assigned to the 36th squadron, stationed here on the Memphis. They are a battle-hardened unit, and your talents will allow you to fit right in. Please also allow me to express my regret at the losses of your wingmen during this mission, and of the GTD Ionia. They will be honoured and afforded the proper ceremonies upon our return to allied space.

Admiral Nekba will be making an address shortly."

5725, "Excellent work protecting the Mesehti. This cruiser will be of assistance in a later mission."

5726, "Welcome aboard the GVD Memphis, pilots. I am Lieutenant-Commander, GTVI's representative aboard this warship. Before losing contact with the GTVA, I was informed of your mission regarding two of our AWACS vessels, and I am most pleased that you were able to protect both ships from the relentless Shivan offensive. While I can not divulge the exact nature of the data they were carrying, I can say that it was immensely valuable for our analysts.

It is with regret that the GVC Mesehti was lost during this operation. They understood the risks, and your safe delivery of those vessels have ensured that their deaths were not in vain.

5850, "Alpha and Beta, get in there and protect our ships! Mesehti, what is your status?"

5851, "Suboptimal, Command. Most of our fighters have been destroyed. Our hulls are holding but not for much longer without additional cover."

5852, "Don't worry Mesehti. We'll clear out those fighters quickly. Come on everyone!"

5853, "Where's the Leyak and Gusion? We're gonna need some more firepower out here, damn it!"

5854, "Concern yourselves with the bombers and fighters, Beta 1. We will handle the enemy warships."

5855, "Jump flash! Rakshasa-class cruiser! Alpha 1, she's got one beam still operational. Lets-"

5856, "Pilots, stand clear of the SC Gusion. Gunnery Control, commence fire!"

5857, "Woah!"

5858, "Did I miss a memo or something? Since when does a Mentu come armed with beam cannons?"

5859, "We have destroyed the Gusion's final anti-warship beam. Pilots, finish off that cruiser while we divert power back to engines."

5860, "The Gusion is going critical. Stand clear!"

5861, "Good work, pilots. Be advised that we are currently experiencing difficulties in contacting GTVA Command. Stand by."

5862, "Hmm. Aren't all inbound comms to the nebula being routed through the Ionia? Hope they didn't leave us behind."

5863, "Doubtful. Command wanted the Ionia to hold its position at the node until ordered otherwise. Ranov's not like Kellermann."

5864, "I suppose. I just hope they... ah never mind."

5865, "<secure channel> Seeing some comms traffic between the Almagest and the Amun. You have any idea what these spooks are up to, three?"

5866, "<secure channel> What, think I'm telepathic? Frankly I'd rather not know. Last thing I wanna do is slip up some GTVI bullshit after having one too many drinks and getting hung for it."

5867, "<secure channel> With what we saw last mission too, it's probably best that we stay in the dark. GTVI's scary."

5868, "<secure channel> Whatever it is, it's gotta be important if they're scrambling regulars like us to cover their asses."

5869, "Mesehti, any news from Command? The longer that we stay here, the less likely we get those AWACS ships out of here safely."

5870, "Negative, Alpha 2. We have yet to regain a communications' link with either Command or the GTD Ionia."

5871, "We were informed earlier that the Shivans had struck the two nearest allied positions$semicolon a rallying point the GTCv York has set up for 3rd Fleet survivors and Supply Depot 7. We do not know the current status of these positions."

5872, "Alpha 1, as the commander of our fighter contingent, you will be responsible for ensuring this convoy is delivered safely from the Shivans. Coupled with your flight record, we feel it should be your choice to decide the safest route. "

5873, "Couldn't we just avoid those routes?"

5874, "Many regions of the nebula remain uncharted, Alpha 3. Intense ionized storms are just some of the dangers we face when making a blind jump."

5875, "The Mesehti's drives have recharged. Amun, Almagest, report."

5876, "Amun here, our drives are spooled. Awaiting coordinates."

5877, "Almagest speaking. We're ready to go."

5878, "Good. Alpha 1, your directives list should present you with your options. Select a route for us to take. We await your decision."

5879, "Almagest here! We've got hostile contacts approaching. Configuration unknown."

5880, "Alpha 1, both of those AWACS ships carry critical data that must reach GTVI. The survival of the Mesehti is of only secondary importance. We can not afford to fail this mission."

5881, "Shivan fighters and bombers incoming! Looks like they're damaged too. Likely the ones responsible for destroying our forces here."

5882, "I say we should give them a warm reception. Don't you agree, Alpha 1?"

5883, "Hang on a second. Is anyone seeing this? Friendly IFF several klicks ahead."

5884, "Affirmative, Alpha 2. We'll have locked on to their signal momentarily. Stand by."

5885, "Friendly has been confirmed as the GTCv York. Reading multiple compartment failures and subsystems inoperable due to battle damage."

5886, "Holy Hell. How are they still holding together?"

5887, "Taurvi bombers designated Gemini have just jumped in. Keep them away from the convoy!"

5888, "Almagest, is there anything we can do?"

5889, "Unfortunately not right now, Alpha 2. Command will have to send a recovery ship to get them out of here. Hopefully we're not too late..."

5890, "We're detecting multiple Shivan bomber wings emerging near the GTCv York."

5891, "Damn! We're too far away to help!"

5892, "Registering multi-compartment collapse aboard the York. There was nothing we could do, Alpha 2."

5893, "Looks like we've got their attention now. Almagest, how long until your drives are recharged?"

5894, "We just need thirty seconds!"

5895, "Roger. This is gonna be close!"

5896, "Several minutes later..."

5897, "Pilots, be advised. We've got a crashed Artemis magnetically clamped on the runway. Be careful when taking off. Beta wing, you are cleared for takeoff."

5898, "All right Alpha, you're up. Takeoff now."

5899, "Pilots, our computers have nearly finished parsing the convoy's location. Stand by for data transfer."

5900, "Uhh, guys? Is my radar glitching out? I'm getting a lot of hostile fuzz out there."

5901, "Not a glitch, Alpha 3. Those signals are very, very real."

5902, "...Shit. They could collapse right on us at any moment."

5903, "One of the boys from the 301st told me the Shivans have been building up out there. Every time we send scouts out there, they're driven straight back."

5904, "That doesn't make sense. Why are they only sending a a few waves of fighters or bombers at a time against us? "

5905, "Come on, Skips. Think I know how a Shivan thinks? "

5906, "If you ask me, I don't think it matters what they think. We should be hitting back at them right now! "

5907, "And that's exactly why you're not gonna make Admiral, Spades. We're not in a position to fight back effectively. All we can do is buy time for our fleets to get the hell out of dodge."

5908, "Cut the chatter, pilots. You should be receiving a series of jump coordinates now. Two jumps total to get there. Alpha 1, depart with your wings when ready. Good hunting out there."

5909, "Coordinates punched in. Lead us out, Alpha 1."

5910, "More bombers incoming!"

5911, "Pilots! Our drives are recharged. Let us depart at once!"

5912, "We've got a wing of Dragons coming in hot. Don't let them sneak up behind you."

5913, "GVD Memphis on station. Hang in there Alpha, our wings will assist you. Now engaging the Shivan corvette."

5914, "Good timing Memphis. We were almost done in."

5915, "All Shivan targets have been destroyed. Amun, what is the status of your ships?"

5916, "The Almagest has sustained heavy damage to its subspace drives and is unable to jump. We require immediate repairs before jumping to the node."

5917, "We will not be jumping to the node, captain. The Shivans have destroyed the Ionia and broken through the blockade. We must first consolidate our forces before we can dare challenge them."

5918, "Wait what? Memphis, did you just say the Ionia was destroyed?"

5919, "That is affirmative, pilot."

5920, "No... t-that's impossible, Memphis! There's no way they could've..."

5921, "Our pilots saw it with their own eyes, Alpha 3. The Shivans succeeded in overpowering the blockade force. Regrettably, there was nothing anyone could have done to save them."

5922, "Memphis Control, Alpha 2. Permission for our wing to dock with your ship? We... don't quite have a base to go back to now."

5923, "Permission granted, Alpha. You may enter our fighterbay."

5924, "Copy. Alpha out."

5925, "<secured transmission> Talk to me, Skips. You okay?"

5926, "<secured transmission> It's just... Volley, Nug, Spades... "

5927, "<secured transmission> It's a lot to take in. Come on, Alpha 1. Think we need to settle down and get our heads clear..."

5928, "I'm picking up an allied cruiser up ahead. It's the GVC Ammit. "

5929, "GVC Ammit, this is the GVC Mesehti. What is your situation?"

5930, "Greetings, Mesehti. We are just about to execute cargo destruction protocols before withdrawing to Gamma Draconis."

5931, "Where's your escort, Ammit? We heard you guys came under attack not too long ago."

5932, "Indeed we had, but our escort skillfully disposed of the Shivan menace. We elected to remain behind to ensure GTVA technology did not fall into enemy hands while our fighters responded to a heavy assault at the jump node."

5933, "Have you had any contact with Command, Ammit? We have been having difficulties in doing so."

5934, "Negative, Almagest. We have had no contact with Allied Command for the past five minutes."

5935, "Cargo destruction protocols have been successfully enacted. Mesehti, do you require additional assistance in getting your AWACS ships to the node?"

5936, "Your assistance would be appreciated, captain. Be advised that Alpha and Beta wings' priority is the protection of those ships over our own vessels. We are sending you coordinates for our next jump. Departing in five minutes."

5937, "Oh shit! Ammit, you've got a Lilith bearing down right on top of you!"

5938, "It is too late-"

5939, "Pilots, stay near the convoy!"

5940, "But-"

5941, "The Amun will interfere with the Hela's beam acquisition. It is advised you stay close to the convoy -- the Shivans will not let us escape so easily!"

5942, "Pilots, Scorpio wing is targeting our radar panels. Intercept them or the Hela will be able to attack us with impunity!"

5943, "Spades, break! You've got Shivans warping in right on top of you!"

5944, "Oh fuck fu-"

5945, "Shit! Beta 3's down! Did he eject?!"

5946, "Negative... took a missile straight to the cockpit."

5947, "Keep focused, pilots! Alpha 1, we gotta take out these fighters or we're not getting these ships back to the node alive!"

5948, "That was too close for comfort. Is everyone still in one piece?"

5949, "Yeah... yeah we're still here. Amun, Almagest, what's your status?"

5950, "Amun here. Our drives are showing signs of stress and will likely need replacing before we jump to Gamma Draconis. The GTD Ionia should be able to provide us with the repairs necessary."

5951, "Almagest speaking. Bad news. We're not going to be able to make another jump for at least twenty minutes. Shivans got some good hits on us in that last fight. We're powering down our drives to avoid a full-scale meltdown."

5952, "Twenty minutes? We've barely got any ammo left for another fight!"

5953, "We are only one jump away from the node, but we are not detecting any communications from the Ionia's beachhead. We have no choice but to activate our emergency distress beacon and hope any allied units nearby can render assistance to us."

5954, "You sure that's a good idea, Mesehti? We'll practically be begging the Shivans to come finish up off!"

5955, "It is our only option, Beta 2. Allied units within range of our call will not only heed it, but will make for it with great haste. Now, maintain vigilance and focus on our surroundings."

5956, "We have noted the direness of our situation. We still can not make contact with either GTVA Command or the GTD Ionia, and our chances of surviving another Shivan attack are minimal. We are broadcasting a distress call on all allied channels. "

5957, "You sure that's a good idea, Amun? We'll practically be begging the Shivans to come finish up off!"

5958, "There's no other option, pilot. Let's just hope allied ships respond to our calls first."

5959, "Heads up! I've got multiple contacts closing in at long range. Hostile configurations!"

5960, "Shit! Moloch corvette, designation Leyak. Three wings of fighters closing in fast. This is it!"

5961, "We are powering down our drives and diverting energy to our primary beam cannon. All units, prepare for battle."

5962, "We are powering up point-defence weapons and acquiring targeting solutions. Pilots, stay close to our ships and work with our gunners in taking down those craft."

5963, "They're all over me! Someone-"

5964, "Eject, Nugs! Ejec-"

5965, "Beta wing's down! Beta wing's down!"

5966, "Hang in there, Skips! We're not dying here!"

5967, "The Amun's going down! Break! Break!"

5968, "We've lost the Almagest!"

5969, "Damn! The Mesehti's gone! Don't let the Shivans take those AWACS ships too!"

5970, "Pilots, we can not take much more damage. You must protect us at all costs!"

5971, "Almagest here! We're under intense enemy fire! We need more fighter cover!"

5972, "All personnel, stand at your posts! We can not fail the Alliance!"

5973, "We've lost our beam jamming capabilities! All ships, brace for imminent fire!"

5974, "Checkpoint 3"

5975, "Heads up! We've got a wing of Astaroths closing in fast!"

From our battles with the rebellious $h Neo-Terran $h Front in $b Alpha $b Centauri$| , $b Sirius and $b Regulus$| , to our recent operations here in the $b nebula$| , our battlegroup has proven time and time again to be capable of tackling any challenge put before us. We now face our greatest challenge yet -- our very survival.
"

5984, "$b{-Allied Retreat$}

In the past twenty-four hours, we have gone from being on the cusp of securing this frontier of space to witnessing a full-scale rout of allied forces from the nebula. We have lost the $f GVD $f Psamtik$| , the $f GVD $f Amunet$| , the $f GTD $f Ionia$| , and numerous other vessels to this renewed $h Shivan onslaught. The death toll is estimated to be over fifty thousand, with thousands more missing-in-action. In addition to the discovery of a $h second $h Sathanas-class $h juggernaut$| , recent operations in the nebula have encountered at least six additional Shivan destroyers and dozens of previously-unreported corvette and cruiser-class warships. One of these destroyers, a $y Ravana$| -class destroyer designated the $h SD $h Andromalius$| , is a cause for growing concern, as it is directly responsible for the destruction of seven allied warships, including the $f Amunet and the $f Ionia$| .
 
With our beachhead at the node lost, all allied units remaining in the nebula are effectively trapped behind enemy lines. All attempts by the $f Memphis to contact Command have failed, suggesting that the Shivans have struck our communication relays in either $b Gamma $b Draconis or $b Capella$| , severing our link to the rest of the Alliance.
"

5985, "$b{-Plan of Action$}

Before we attempt to escape the nebula, there are still two objectives here that must be completed.

Our first objective is to render necessary repairs to the $f Memphis ahead of a push through to $b Gamma $b Draconis$| . Our recent offensive operation that bought time for the safe withdrawal of many allied assets came at the cost of our photon beam cannons, which were finally spent during our victorius but intense engagement with the $h SD $h Ashimmu$| . Although we are escorted by our comrades aboard the $f GVCv $f Maahes and the $f GVC $f Shu$| , who have served skillfully alongside the $f Memphis since the formation of our battlegroup, we will need the firepower of our main guns to ensure a safe retreat to $b Capella$| . Intelligence has pointed us to a number of cargo depots far behind the Shivan advance which may contain the parts necessary to bring our guns back online.

Secondly, we are aware that thousands of allied personnel remain stranded in the nebula outside of our small fleet. It is our obligation as officers of the $f GTVA to spare any available resources to find them -- to shepherd them back safely to allied space.

All squadron leaders are to report to quarterdeck, where I will brief you of your squadrons' orders. Sa Vasuda, and Sa Terra."

5986, "Greetings, pilots. Welcome to the $g 36th $g Orbos-Gak Squadron. I am Commander Phrem, the squadron commander. This squadron has served the $Y Imperial $Y Dynasty well for many a season since its upbringing aboard the $f PVD $f Guardian$|. The $g 36th have faithfully served the Vasudan people at our most desperate times$semicolon from the battlefields of $b Antares at the height of the $y 14 $y Year $y War$| , to the carnage that consumed our space during the $y Great $y War and along the $b Alpha $b Centauri$|-$b Sirius$|-$b Deneb line in the recent $r NTF conflict. Named in honour of a fierce species of predators from the northern ocean of $y Vasuda $y Prime$| , we are one of the few named squadrons in the Vasudan half of the $f GTVA$|, having earned it through hard-fought successes. With the decommissioning of the $f Guardian in 2365, we have come to call the $f Memphis our home. Your presence will surely add to this squadron's prestige. 

Allow me to express my condolences for the loss of your flagship. I had the privilage of serving aboard the $f Ionia as part of the Officer Exchange Program at the onset of the rebellion. Admiral Ranov was an officer who worked tirelessly to maintain the bond between our two species. They will be missed."

5987, "As you know, our fleet will be making a run for the $b Gamma $b Draconis node$|. However, our current state leaves much to be desired, and our chances of successfully returning to $b Capella are minimal unless we can bring the $f Memphis' guns back online.

With $h Shivan attention focused towards $b Capella$|, we find ourselves in a unique position to solve our current dilemma. Scouts have reported that at least five allied supply depots lie intact, with light Shivan presences confirmed at or near these locations. While the $f Memphis will continue to serve as a rallying point for scattered allied units, multiple fighter wings will be launched to attack and destroy these depots. The Admiral intends to make this a very visible operation that will hopefully deceive the Shivans as to our real goal."

5988, "Fighter Wings"

5989, "At the center of our operation is $f Supply $f Depot $f 15$| . Unlike the other depots, we will not be destroying this one. This site was constructed by the $f 13th $f Battlegroup to support allied offensives deeper into the nebula, and according to logistics logs a pair of cargo containers carrying photon beam parts had been delivered to this location a few days ago. The defence force at the depot was wiped out in a $h Shivan attack several hours ago, and if the other depots are an indication, we suspect this one to also still be intact.

$g Alpha wing, you will be entrusted with this mission. Your first objective will be to secure the area of any Shivan fighters. Once all hostiles are down, you must scan the containers to locate the parts."

5990, "Depot 15"

5991, "Shivan Fighters"

5992, "Once these are located, the $f Memphis will then deploy $f Sigma $f 1 and $f Sigma $f 2 to recover the cargo and haul them back. Because we only have two freighters available, we will deploy only one at a time to maximize survivability. Protect these ships at all costs. If possible, we may redeploy $f Sigma to retrieve other essential cargo such as medical supplies. You will be relieved for that phase of the operation however."

5993, "Cargo Depot 15"

5994, "Because we are trying to draw $h Shivan forces towards other engagement zones, your wing will be the only one sortied in your area of operation during the main phase of the mission. $f Beta wing will be deployed to secure the area should further recovery of supplies be viable, but only after we have recovered both cargo pods. Be warned that the Shivans will become suspicious of our intentions at this depot when they realize we are not attacking it.

A survivor from the 251st, Lieutenant Nehebu, will be joining $g Alpha wing from now on. I believe you have flown alongside him in a previous operation, and based on your performances thus far, I feel he would benefit the most from flying in your wing.

One last thing. While receiving a heavy influx of survivors to our hanger bays, the fighters that you arrived in were damaged and have been deemed dangerous to fly without proper repairs. Fortunately we have a number of $y Seth$| -class fighters modified for Terran use that are still space-worthy. You will have to make do with these craft while our other fighters are being repaired. Good luck out there, pilots."

5995, "Alpha 4"

5996, "Welcome back, Alpha. You performed exceptional in your first sortie with the 36th squadron. Our engineers are already hard at work in getting our main beam cannons back online, and we can expect to have sufficient firepower to lead our forces back to allied lines. Unfortunately Sigma wing was unable to retrieve more supplies as heavy Shivan reinforcements swarmed into the area. Beta wing ensured that all cargo was destroyed before withdrawing back to the Memphis.

The GTC Audacious arrived at our rally point safely. The crew of the Audacious sends their thanks for protecting them from those bombers.

You also managed to destroy the Mephisto-class freighters before they could steal some of the cargo from the depot. Denying our enemy our technology is a top priority for the Alliance, and you fulfilled this priority while under heavy fire. Excellent work.

Alpha 1, Admiral Nekba has specifically requested for you to partake in an upcoming operation of great importance to the fleet. You will return to this briefing room in one hour. It seems your skills have not gone unnoticed, Terran."

5997, "Great work saving the Audacious. This cruiser will be of assistance in a later mission."

5998, "Welcome back, Alpha. You performed well in your first sortie with the 36th squadron.

6003, "You can order your wingmen to protect the Audacious while you engage Sagittarius wing.

Destroying Aries wing quickly should make it easier to destroy Zodiac freighters before they escape."

6004, "Because of heavy Shivan resistance, our operation has failed. Unless a new plan can be formulated, we will have to push through the Shivans with what meager strength we have."

6005, "You may want to intercept the Shivan attack wings as soon as possible. This will buy time for the freighters to dock and depart with the cargo."

6006, "Your despicable actions put the lives of your wingmen and risk. Upon our return to Terran-Vasudan space, you will be handed  over to the 2nd Fleet to face a court-martial. You are hereby confined to the Memphis' brig until then."

6050, "Not too bad. Turning's pretty good, armour and shielding are top notch. Gun placements are nice. Still going to take a while to get used to these Vasudan control systems though."

6051, "I hear you. Took me a few sorties to get used to them during my first exchange back in '64. Hell, I'd only been on the Ionia for two months before heading to Beta Aquilae. The Chnum was a fine ship."

6053, "-sigh-...It's not our fault, three. "

6054, "I keep telling myself that, too. Still feel like we should've been there."

6055, "I know it sucks, but... You know? When we get some free time, the three of us should check in with the Psamtik's survivors. Perhaps we could take part in one of those Vasudan meditation sessions."

6056, "Huh. I thought they would've gone to the Toeris instead of jumping battlegroups."

6057, "Technically they should've, but times are tough. Besides, the Toeris already had a four to one pilot to ship ratio, and the Memphis' own air wing had taken casualties. "

6058, "Well, at least we're still getting put to some good use. In regards to your proposal, I think that'd be a good idea. "

6073, "Mayday! Mayday! GTC Audacious to allied fighters, we need immediate fighter cover right now!"

6074, "GTC Audacious, this is the GVD Memphis, 11th Battlegroup. What is your status? "

6075, "Our status? Our hull plating is literally peeling off right now! We've been on the run for the past eight hours and have only come across abandoned rallypoints and debris fields. Not to mention Shivans left, right and center!"

6076, "Calm down, Audacious. We are sending you nav coordinates to our rallypoint. Is your Captain present?"

6077, "Negative, Memphis. Captain Burana's KIA and most of the bridge staff is incapacitated. I've taken command of the ship. Weapons Officer Masawa at your service."

6078, "Audacious. Be advised that this location is currently not under our control, and that Alpha wing is currently undergoing an important operation. They will assist you if they can, but your gunners may need to fend for themselves. Did you get that Alpha?"

6079, "Roger that Memphis. We'll do what we can."

6080, "Thank you Memphis. Your help is appreciated in any way possible, Alpha wing. We will use our emergency drives to rendezvous with the fleet - the damage we've sustained prevents us from assisting you and your mission. Departing in two minutes."

6081, "Incoming Basilisks. Targetting says they're going for the cargo containers!"

6082, "Shit! Sagittarius is targetting the containers and Leo bombers are going for the Audacious. Alpha 1, we're going to have to split up to beat back both attacks!"

6083, "Gunnery, power up point defences! We're one jump away from salvation. Let's give those Shivan bastards something to think about!"

6084, "Shit! Reactor core breach detected. All hands aban-"

6085, "Command, the Audacious has been destroyed. I don't think anyone would have survived that..."

6086, "Do not let their deaths be in vain - ensure that cargo makes it back to the Memphis! We shall mourn their deaths at a later time."

6087, "Roger Memphis Control... God damn it..."

6088, "Bomber threat nullified. Our ETD is 30 seconds."

6089, "Audacious here. We're departing for the Memphis. Good luck with your mission, pilots!"

6101, "Pilots, we are deploying Beta wing to relieve you. Exceptional work today. You may return to base."

6102, "We put on a good show, Alpha 1. Got the keys to the door. Now we just gotta get the Memphis fixed up and we're out of here."

6103, "I do not suspect Admiral Nekba will move too quickly. He did say that he wishes to rally as many survivors as possible before we leave, lest they be left out here to face the Destroyers' wrath. We can not allow that to happen without at least trying."

6104, "Agreed. I just hope we can weather whatever the Shivans throw at us. Come on, let's get back to the Memphis.

"

6105, "Zodiac 1 has docked with one of the Vasudan containers. They're making a run for it!"

6106, "Zodiac 2's moving away from the depot with a container in tow. Stop them!"

6107, "Bingo. Container 2230-8094 holds spare beam emitter panels."

6108, "Looks like container 0155-9255 has fresh parts to replace the Memphis' beams."

6109, "Memphis, Alpha 2 here. Picking up contacts up ahead, most likely Shivan."

6110, "Received, Alpha 2. Secure the area quickly and ascertain the status of the depot. Memphis out."

6111, "Alpha 4 here. It is an honour to fly alongside the three of you again. I was most impressed during our last sortie together."

6112, "Really? The mission where we let over 700 sailors die while we did nothing? There's so much to be impressed about it, that's for sure."

6113, "My apologies, Alpha 3. I did not mean to offend you or the brave crews of those ships."

6114, "Focus, pilots. Hostiles are now on scope. Four Maras."

6115, "Roger, Two. Get ready for to pop countermeasures."

6116, "Positive ID on the depot. Looks like it's still in one piece."

6117, "Two Shivan freighters have warped in. Destroy them before they can steal any of the containers."

6118, "The area is clear. Alpha 1 and 2, proceed to scan the cargo containers. Alpha 3 and 4, provide overwatch for them."

6119, "Roger that, Memphis. Come on Alpha 1, let's find those parts."

6120, "Assuming patrol pattern. Come on Alpha 4."

6121, "Alpha to Memphis. We've found both of the mission containers. What's Sigma's ETA?"

6122, "Excellent work finding those containers Alpha. Sigma's 1 and 2 are still on standby, and we will deploy Sigma 1 immediately. Their ETA is three minutes."

6123, "Copy that Memphis. Is there any chance of backup? I doubt this'll go smoothly."

6124, "Negative, Alpha 2. The Admiral does not want to attract further Shivan attention to the depots. You will have to complete the mission with what resources you have available. Memphis out."

6125, "Alpha 3, about earlier-"

6126, "No...no Alpha 4, you don't need to apologize. I'm sorry for the way I acted back there. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that."

6127, "All is forgiven. I am of the understanding that the GTD Ionia was your homeship? Its loss must be painful."

6128, "Yeah. We lost a lot of good people on that ship. Most of our squadron, us included, were elsewhere when it happened. Now I think we're the only ones from the Ionia still alive."

6129, "Volley... Spades... Nugget... Damn it, we should've been there."

6130, "It wouldn't have made a difference, Skips. It was a shit situation. Right now a lot of people are counting on us now to get them back home. Don't put that extra weight on your shoulders, all right?"

6131, "I know..."

6132, "As the only surviving pilot of the 251st Squadron, I have made it my duty to do whatever I can to get as many Vasudans and Terrans back to allied space. My father taught me that grief can be more than a burden, but a tool to achieve great things."

6133, "Your father sounds like an inspirational speaker."

6134, "He has a way with his words, that is for certain.
"

6135, "Pilots, we recommend you rearm before Sigma 2 arrives."

6136, "We have destroyed Aquarius wing."

6137, "Sigma 2 exiting subspace. Now proceeding to retrieve cargo. Please provide escort for us, Alpha wing."

6138, "Looks like we're one step closer to getting out of this mess. Let's not screw this up."

6139, "We'll try our hardest not to,"

6140, "Virgo's running interference. Don't let them distract you!"

6141, "What's the status on the other attacks, Memphis?"

6142, "Most of our assault teams have broken off their attacks because of Shivan reinforcements, but at least two other attacks are still in progress."

6147, "Alpha 1 is sent to slip past Shivan positions at the Gamma Draconis node and see what awaits the Memphis' fleet on the other side.
"

6148, "Greetings, $g Alpha $g 1$|. While your wingmates are sortied to escort the $f GVCv $f Sopedu to our current position, Admiral Nekba has selected you to undertake an important mission. Success in this mission is crucial for ensuring our successful reunion with the $f GTVA$|.

For this operation, you will be flying a $y Pegasus$| -class stealth fighter. The pilot of this craft has been admitted to our medical bay due to combat injuries, but the fighter remains intact. This is a fortunate occurrence as the $f Memphis has yet to receive a complement of our own $y Ptah stealth fighters."

6149, "We need you to scout $h Shivan fortifications on the far side of the $b Gamma $b Draconis node. Reconnaissance has detected heavy subspace activity in the area, so it may be possible the Shivans have either reinforced their positions or deployed further expeditionary forces through the node. Detection during this operation will almost guarantee a hardening of Shivan defences, $W so $W maintaining $W stealth $W is $W imperative$|."

6150, "At 2531 Vasudan Standard Time a scouting wing from the 33rd discovered a  $y Lilith$| -class cruiser, designated the $h SC $h Hypnus$|, moving along a known route towards the jump node. We believe in about twenty minutes it will arrive at the node and depart through it. Departing through the node as the $h Hypnus enters subspace should mask your jump signature, allowing you to slip into $b Gamma $b Draconis undetected.

It is estimated that you will have approximately three minutes to scout the area around the node before the Hypnus reaches it. Scan any Shivan warships you uncover, as this will assist with our breakout plans. This in turn will minimize damage sustained to our ships, which will undoubtedly help us in further operations."

6151, "Hypnus"

6152, "Fortunately, the stabilization of the node has reduced the time it will take to traverse it. Whereas once it had taken over ten Terran standard hours to travel through the portal, it will now take approximately 73 minutes to reach $b Gamma $b Draconis$|.

Upon arriving in-system, you will be tasked with determining the strength of enemy forces. Scan any hostile warships present while avoiding detection."

6153, "Shivan Forces?"

6154, "While the sensors of transports, freighters and warships are unable to pick up the Pegasus on their radars, fighter and bombercraft will be able to detect you if you stray too close. To remain undetected, you must stay $W 600 $W meters away from enemy patrols while in the nebula, and $W 1200 $W meters upon arrival in $b Gamma $b Draconis$|. Any activity from your afterburner will be detected immediately, as will firing your weapons. You will need to engage $W $quoteStealth $W Mode$quote $W (Shift+N)$| , which will prevent accidental discharge of these systems."

6155, "Once you have completed your tasks and are safely away from any $h Shivan patrols, you may jump out to a pre-designated location and await the $f GVD $f Memphis's arrival. Attempting to jump back through the node only risks detection by the Shivans. We intend to evacuate the nebula once all repairs are complete, which should be in three hours' time.

Good luck, pilot."

6156, "Welcome back to the Memphis, Alpha 1.

Shortly after you completed your mission, a Shivan scouting wing discovered our fleet's rallying point and forced us to move up our timetables for breaking through to Gamma Draconis. Fortunately your reconnaissance mission gave us the intelligence necessary to complete this maneuver without incurring any losses to the fleet, although a number of our vessels were damaged during the breakout. While work still needs to be done to bring the Memphis' guns to full operational status, we had sufficient energy in our cannons to break through Shivan lines. We destroyed the SC Sugriva and drove back the SCv Abraxis upon entry into the system, and we are now holding position in the outer reaches of the system while our fleet gathers.

The SD Nebiros is a matter of concern, however. According to the data you gathered, this destroyer did not depart for the Capella jump node. Given the superiority of Shivan subspace technology and navigation, we believe the vessel is waiting to ambush the fleet should we attempt to escape. Long-range scans have already detected a sizable Shivan force gathering around the node. We must divide and conquer the Shivans before we can return to Allied-controlled space.

I am pleased to report the rest of your wing successfully completed their mission. They have arrived in Gamma Draconis with the GVCv Sopedu and should be returning to the Memphis soon where you may reunite with them.

One last thing. During the brief period that we had control of the node, a transport docked with the GTC Warwick and recovered nearly a hundred survivors from the cruiser. These crewpersons are now recovering aboard the Memphis and have expressed gratitude for your role in finding them. Excellent work, pilot.."

6157, "Scanning all Shivan warships in the nebula will help minimize damage to GTVA forces during their escape."

6158, "Welcome back to the Memphis, Alpha 1.

Shortly after you completed your mission, a Shivan scouting wing discovered our fleet's rallying point and forced us to move up our timetables for breaking through to Gamma Draconis. Fortunately your thorough reconnaissance mission gave us the intelligence necessary to complete this maneuver without incurring any losses to the fleet and suffering only minor damage. While work still needs to be done to bring the Memphis' guns to full operational status, we had sufficient energy in our cannons to break through Shivan lines. We destroyed the SC Sugriva and drove back the SCv Abraxis upon entry into the system, and we are now holding position in the outer reaches of the system while our fleet gathers.

The SD Nebiros is a matter of concern, however. According to the data you gathered, this destroyer did not depart for the Capella jump node. Given the superiority of Shivan subspace technology and navigation, we believe the vessel is waiting to ambush the fleet should we attempt to escape. Long-range scans have already detected a sizable Shivan force gathering around the node. We must divide and conquer the Shivans before we can return to Allied-controlled space.

I am pleased to report the rest of your wing successfully completed their mission. They have arrived in Gamma Draconis with the GVCv Sopedu and should be returning to the Memphis soon where you may reunite with them.

One last thing. During the brief period that we had control of the node, a transport docked with the GTC Warwick and recovered nearly a hundred survivors from the cruiser. These crewpersons are now recovering aboard the Memphis and have expressed gratitude for your role in finding them. Excellent work, pilot."

6159, "The mission was a failure. With stealth compromised, the Shivans have begun to further fortify the jump node. Furthermore, enemy scout wings have discovered our position, and we are left with no other option but to push through the enemy's blockade. We will undoubtably suffer heavy losses."

6160, "Your directives will track the distance of the nearest member of the listed wing."

6161, "The mission was a failure. Without adequate intelligence of Shivan force composition on the other side of the node, we risk running into a trap. Furthermore, enemy scout wings have discovered our position, and we are left with no other option but to push through the enemy's blockade. We will undoubtably suffer heavy losses."

6248, "At 29:30 Vasudan Standard Time, the final ships of our fleet still in the nebula entered $b{ Gamma Draconis $} and jumped to our rallying point. With our forces gathered, Admiral Nekba has devised a plan that will both create an avenue of escape for our ships while striking a major blow to the $h Shivan fleet."

6249, "Preceding our arrival, $g Alpha $g 1 conducted a solo reconnaissance mission into $b Gamma $b Draconis to determine the strength of the enemy's fortifications. $g Alpha $g 1 encountered a $y Ravana$|-class destroyer, the $h SD $h Nebiros$| , which we have yet to locate since our arrival. Although the possibility exists that the destroyer has since moved on to $b Capella$| , our scans of the warship's navigation subsystem determine that it was not departing for the node. Admiral Nekba believes the $h Nebiros is currently waiting for us to make the next move so that it may ambush us.

Our plan is to draw out the $h Nebiros and destroy it."

6250, "In one hour, several of our warships and squadrons will split up and strike multiple $h Shivan targets of opportunity in an effort to force the $h Nebiros out of hiding. The 563rd and 567th will attack a large cargo depot located in the inner part of the system while the 33rd squadron will monitor the nebula node for Shivan reinforcements. The $f{ GTCv Syracuse $} and the 411th will engage a Shivan mustering point where several cruisers are gathering.

Your goal here will be to ensure the corvette's survival, as we anticipate the Shivans will retaliate with multiple bomber wings and possibly warships. By defeating these forces, we hope to present a credible enough threat to force the $h Nebiros to enter the area and challenge us."

6269, "Should the $h Shivan destroyer arrive, Admiral Nekba will commit the $f Memphis to a direct engagement against this vessel. Your task during this phase of the operation will be to disarm the $h Nebiros' beam cannons, in particular its two primary cannons, and intercept bomber craft sortied against the $f Memphis$| . Additional fighter and bomber wings are being held in reserve should this engagement occur, so you can expect immediate allied reinforcement during the final stage of the mission.

Should the $h Nebiros emerge at another engagement, or if an unexpected development occurs, $f Memphis $f Tactical will issue new orders. Good luck out there, pilots."

6270, "Welcome back aboard the Memphis, pilots. I'm afraid that our mission did not exactly go as planned. The presence of the SD Andromalius, which likely arrived shortly after Sigma wing was driven away from the Nebula node, has reduced our chance of escaping Gamma Draconis, and the damage sustained during the battle has left the Memphis in a reduced state of effectiveness. Our engineers are presently hard at work repairing what they can, and hopefully we can get the rest of our primary beam weapons operational before our next engagement.

Since we have entered Gamma Draconis, we have suffered minor losses to our fighter and bomber wings. So far we have avenged these souls with the destruction of six Shivan warships and numerous smaller craft. Dozens of Shivan cargo units were destroyed in the concurrent depot raid, and we hope that this will relieve our forces fighting on the frontlines in Capella. Additionally, a new scouting wing deployed to the Nebula node have just reported that the SD Nebiros has now withdrawn from the system, likely to repair the damage we inflicted upon it. This can still be counted as a partial victory.

The fleet is rendezvousing at a new rallying point, from where we will make the necessary repairs before advancing on the Capella node. Get some rest while you can. Dismissed."

6397, "I have heard rumours that Admiral Nekba and his command staff are awaiting some sort of $quotesignal$quote. Perhaps GTVA High Command intends to launch a counter-offensive to retake this system?"

6398, "With what? The Colossus? She barely took down one juggernaut and is still licking her wounds. Command would be stupid to send her here to face down another Sathanas with a full fleet supporting it."

6399, "Rumours are just that: rumours. No one's gonna send the Colossus here without additional backup. All of our destroyers are busy covering the evacuations or limping their way back to Vega or Epsilon Pegasi."

6400, "Hmm. That would be a tactical error indeed. Maybe instead-"

6401, "Narmada convoy has entered the area. I'm counting nine freighters, one transport, one cruiser and two fighter wings. Signalling the Maahes now."

6402, "The escorting fighters are breaking off to attack! Brace yourselves!"

6413, "Roger that, Maahes. Moving to intercept Aquarius wing."

6414, "We've destroyed more than half of the convoy. Keep it up!"

6415, "I think that was some excellent work we did there, Alpha 1. Not one ship from that convoy made it to subspace."

6416, "All right. That ought to stir up the hornets' nest."

6417, "Memphis, this is the Maahes. We have completed phase one of the operation. Beginning patrol pattern now."

6418, "Roger that, Captain Kherty. Be advised that the other operations are now underway, so expect the Shivans to react. We will update you as the situation changes. Pilots, advise you call in for a support ship to rearm. Memphis out."

6419, "Hey Nehebu, what was all that about before we launched?"

6420, "I beg your pardon, Alpha 2?"

6421, "You and Commander Phrem. I'd taken my translator out for a moment while inspecting my helmet, and Alphas' 1 and 3 hadn't arrived on the deck yet."

6422, "Ah, yes. Commander Phrem was concerned about my flight performance during our last mission. He was giving me $quotepointers$quote as you would say."

6423, "I see. It's just that from his body language, he seemed pretty riled up. Maybe even angry? For a second it looked like he was going to drag you out of your fighter."

6424, "It is nothing serious, Alpha 2. Now let us return to the mission at hand. The Shivans may arrive at any moment."

6425, "Contact! A wing of Basilisks have jumped in."

6428, "Memphis, this is Syracuse Actual. The SC Hypnus has just broken off from our field of engagement. It may be heading your way  Be advised that its main cannon is damaged but still operational."

6429, "Understood, Captain De Palma. Alpha wing, be ready to disarm that cruiser. We are preparing to launch a wing of bombers to nullify the warship."

6430, "You heard him, Alpha! Be ready to close the distance on the Hypnus as soon as it arrives!"

6431, "The SC Hypnus has emerged from subspace! All hands, brace for heavy beam fire!"

6436, "Coordinates received. We are jumping out now."

6437, "How're you holding up, Maahes? That last fight was a pretty tough one."

6438, "Thanks to your escort, all is well. Our medical team reports only light casualties."

6439, "The Valac's beams penetrated multiple compartments during the last engagement. We have taken casualties, but we must push on no matter the cost."

6440, "Hopefully we've gotten the Nebiros' attention. I doubt we'll beat back another attack like that."

6441, "We have nullified the first wave of attackers, but remain vigilant. The Shivans will not let this go unpunished."

6442, "This is Delta 1, 33rd Squadron. A Rakshasa-class cruiser has just arrived from the nebula jump node. We are determining their intended destination now."

6443, "Iota wing has cleared the fighterbay. Now targetting the SC Hypnus."

6444, "More Terrans flying Vasudan craft? Truly a sight to behold. The way they fly makes it obvious."

6453, "$b{ -Gamma Draconis $}
$b{ -GVD Memphis $}
$b{ -July 18th, 2367 $}

$b -Situation

To all officers and crew of the $f{ 11th Battlegroup $} and our accompanying ships, this is Admiral Nekba.

We have regrouped our forces, and work is now underway to repair our ships after our recent engagements with the $r Shivan armada here in $b Gamma $b Draconis$| . We are presently taking refuge at $b{ Collection Site Sigma$}$| , a dumping ground where surrendered and confiscated $R NTF equipment and supplies from their offensive on the Knossos had been stored pending either disposal or reclamation by allied specialists. Because our alliance necessitates a high degree of compatibility between Terran and Vasudan electronics systems, these supplies will be of invaluable use towards preparing our fleet for the forthcoming evacuation of the system. 

Additionally, the $f GVA $f Amun and the $f GTA $f Almagest are blanketing our region of space with an ECM field, making it difficult for the $h Shivans to pick up local communications, and engineers have modified a number of $y Pharos bouys from the $f Phoenicia recovery operation to serve as both an early warning system and track any radio signals in our region.

However, our arrival in $b{ Gamma Draconis $} has brought two issues to our attention that we must face."

6454, "$b{ -The SD Andromalius $}

Our most pressing concern is the $y Ravana$| -class destroyer $r Andromalius$| . First encountered after allied forces returned to the nebula system, officers from the $f{ GTVI's Signals Intelligence $} branch had come to the conclusion that the $r Andromalius had assumed command over the remnants of the $r Shivan fleet in the aftermath of the first $r Sathanas' destruction. This assumption was based on the ship's passive movements and lack of sighting at several key engagements. With the arrival of the second juggernaut to assume authority, the $r Andromalius then shifted into what can only be described as a relentless hunter as many of us have witnessed.

We are faced with a powerful foe. Unlike other vessels of the same class, this warship is layered in additional armour, and the devastating shock-jumps it employs makes it the Shivans' most effective predator of our capital ships. Now that this destroyer has followed us here, we must take extra precautions if we are to successfully return to allied space."

6455, "$b{ -Scattered allied units $}

Secondly is the status of $f GTVA units in the system not a part of our fleet. Survivors rescued from the wreckage of the $f{ GTC Warwick $} have informed us that Vice-Admiral Mekh of the $f{ GVD Hedetet $} had opted to remain in the system to coordinate the evacuation of GTVA forces to $b Capella$| . This decision came after the $f Ionia beachhead fell, and contact with GTVA Command severed following a $r Shivan strike against military communication relays in $b Capella responsible for providing a link to allied units in $b{ Gamma Draconis $} and beyond.

All contact with the $f Hedetet was lost shortly after they responded to a renewed Shivan offensive on the $b Capella jump node, commanded by the $h SD $h Nebiros$| . Another Shivan destroyer, the $h SD $h Daityas$| , led the attacks against our rallying points throughout the system, causing a cascade of supply ships, freighters, gas miners and transports to flood the node, turning an organized withdrawal into a vicious massacre. The $h Daityas was reportedly disabled during its last engagement, but the $f Warwick's survivors are unaware of its location. We will need to act carefully, as this destroyer may still pose a threat to our escape.

Any allied units which survived the attacks at both the rallying points and the node will have gone to ground, and because we can not risk alerting the Shivans to our location, we can only hope that our sensor systems can detect these survivors before the Shivans find them."

6456, "$b{ -Preparations for escape $}

Squadron assignments will be updated at all terminals. All pilots and personnel will be on four hour rotations divided into three shifts. We expect to make our move on the $b Capella jump node in twelve hours' time."

6457, "I hope you have had an adequate rest period, pilots, because a new assignment has just been handed down to our unit.

Less than fifteen minutes ago one of our $y Pharos clusters picked up an allied transponder signal belonging to the $f{ GTM Comfort$}$|, a medical frigate which had been caught up in the disastrous battle at the $b Capella jump node."

6458, "Comfort"

6459, "The $f Comfort has since made two jumps, moving to seemingly random locations across the system. Additional unidentified radio signals have been following it since we picked them up. It is believed that the $f Comfort is in pursuit by $r Shivan forces and attempting to evade them.

Because communicating with the medical ship or deploying a large force risks revealing our location to the enemy, $g Alpha wing will be initially sortied alone to ascertain the situation. Upon launch, you will loiter around the $f Memphis until we can determine the $f Comfort's next jump vector."

6460, "Shivan Pursuers?"

6461, "Once you have made contact with the $f Comfort and determined their status, $g Alpha wing will protect the vessel until they can depart and join up with the fleet. Should any further developments arise, $g Alpha will send a coded, one-way transmission to the $f Memphis for reinforcements, provided by $f Beta wing. A direct communications link could very well narrow down the $h Shivans' search of our location. Further reinforcements may be deployed should they become available. Fly well out there, pilots."

6462, "Excellent work, pilots. Not only were you successful in getting those convoys out of harms way, but you saved every freighter, transport and other auxillary ships from destruction. It is a shame the GTC Goose Green was lost by the Daityas' surprise attack, but there was nothing at all that you could have done to prevent their destruction. Thanks to your vigilant cover, their sacrifice was not in vain.

In recognition of your outstanding performance, you have been awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

Admiral Nekba has integrated these new arrivals to our fleet, and with both the supplies we have secured from Collection Site Sigma and the cargo the ships you saved were carrying, our fleet will be fully prepared to crack open the Shivan blockade of the Capella jump node once repairs are complete. We anticipate the breakout operation to commence in six hours.

Until then, your time is yours. Dismissed."

6463, "Your failure to protect the GTM Comfort from a minimal Shivan force will forever be a stain on our squadron's reputation, pilots! 

Since the loss of the Comfort, we have not picked up any other distress signals within Gamma Draconis. Perhaps they were the only other survivors in the system.

I'm afraid our failure will see our squadron serve in a rear-line role for the duration of our stay in this system. This was avoidable."

6464, "Apart from the GTM Comfort, all ships of its flotilla were annihilated by the Shivans. Although losses are to be expected, words can not describe how terribly we failed.

I'm afraid our failure will see our squadron serve in a rear-line role for the duration of our stay in this system. This was avoidable."

6465, "Focus on Shivan bombers and heavy fighters and let your wingmates deal with the other threats. Protecting the GVG Anjet, while doable, is tough and leaving it to the Shivans may help in keeping a tight cover around the second convoy."

6466, "Thanks to your efforts, you were able to save much of the flotilla from the Shivan attack. It is a shame the GTC Goose Green was lost by the Daityas' surprise attack, but there was nothing at all that you could have done to prevent their destruction. Thanks to your vigilant cover, their sacrifice was not in vain.

Admiral Nekba has integrated these new arrivals to our fleet, and with both the supplies we have secured from Collection Site Sigma and the cargo the ships you saved were carrying, our fleet will be prepared to crack open the Shivan blockade of the Capella jump node once repairs are complete. We anticipate the breakout operation to commence in six hours.

Until then, your time is yours. Dismissed."

6467, "Today was a massacre, pilots. Much of the flotilla was destroyed by a fierce Shivan attack. While you were outnumbered, perhaps some of those ships could have been saved had you been more proactive in prioritizing threats. We recognize there was nothing you could have done to save the GTC Goose Green, however. At least their deaths were not entirely in vain.

Admiral Nekba has integrated these new arrivals to our fleet, and with both the supplies we have secured from Collection Site Sigma and the cargo the ships you saved were carrying, our fleet should be prepared to break through the Shivan blockade of the Capella jump node once repairs are complete.

6622, "Alpha to Goose Green, you gotta get your engines back online! The Daityas will be dumping fighters any second now!"

6623, "There's no time, pilot!"

6624, "We... we can not save them..."

6625, "I want all our power diverted to anti-fighter beams! It's time to make the GTVA proud! "

6626, "All convoy elements, the Mesehti is slowing down to form a rear-guard for you. Make towards us with due haste!"

6627, "Internal compartment breach now in effect! Pilots, you must protect-"

6628, "Alpha wing! We've datalinked our point defences, but we won't last long against that many fighters. We still need two minutes before we can jump!"

6629, "Understood! Come on, Alpha 1! We're not letting anymore of our people die!"

6630, "Preserver here! Our drives have finished recharging. Now departing to designated coordinates. Thanks for covering us, pilots!"

6631, "We're done here. Alpha 1, let's jump back to the Memphis!"

6632, "Shit! We gotta get out of here! Activate your jump drives!"

6633, "This is the GTSC Wilkins. We've received the coordinates for the Memphis' rallypoint. We were afraid the Alliance had left us behind."

6634, "Fear not, Terran. Admiral Nekba has no intention of leaving anyone behind in this system."

6635, "Couldn't the Admiral spare a few more fighters to cover us? How are four fighters supposed to properly cover us, let alone the rest of the convoy?"

6636, "We've got more backup coming, but it'll be some time. Fleet's running under radio silence in the meantime. Last thing we need now's the Memphis getting shock jumped by the Andromalius."

6637, "Three Maras, designated Scorpio, have warped in! Alpha, keep them away from our ships! We won't be able to survive many more hits!"

6638, "We'll keep you covered, Wilkins! Alpha wing, engage!"

6639, "Watch it! A wing of Basilisks have jumped in. They're targeting the ships!"

6640, "Four Nahema bombers on sensors. Intercept them before they can release their payloads!"

6641, "Alpha wing's cleared the fighterbay."

6642, "Alpha, move into holding formation as we feed you your coordinates. Stand by."

6643, "Man. Fleet's not looking too good right now."

6644, "We did a lot of damage though. Heard the 563rd took out a Moloch during their engagement."

6645, "Not surprising. From what I've gathered those pilots are made of steel. You know any of them, Nehebu?"

6646, "Not personally, but my former wing leader flew with them during the failed counter-attack in Sirius. They played an instrumental role in the destruction of the Cormorant and its fleet before the GVD Ophois' fall and their transfer to the Memphis."

6647, "Shit, I heard about that. That invasion was a modern-day Gallipoli. I take it you fought there?"

6648, "Yes. They may have well been the worst six days of my life. The death and carnage of that campaign was... incomprehensible. Thankfully the Psamtik honoured our dead by taking down the Cyrene in the later invasion."

6649, "Alpha wing, you computers should have received the coordinates. You may depart now. Remember that communications with the Memphis are to be kept to a minimum. Find those survivors. Memphis out."

6650, "Understood Memphis. Alpha 1, lead us out."

6651, "Heads up! Hippocrates-class medical frigate on sensors. Alpha 1, there's a wing of Nahema's bearing down on that ship!"

6652, "Alpha wing, this is the GTM Comfort, 3rd Fleet Medical Flotilla. Our escort is depleted and we need immediate assistance!"

6653, "We read you, Comfort. Just give us a second, we'll mop up those bombers for you."

6654, "Don't worry about Aries wing, Alpha. We'll keep 'em occupied!"

6655, "All Shivan craft have been destroyed. The area is secure for the time being."

6656, "GTM Comfort, Alpha 2 here. We've defeated the Shivan attack force. What's your status? "

6657, "The ship's holding together, but I don't want to put her through another fight if I can help it. The last few jumps have put our subspace drives into critical territory. As soon as we get the green light, we're jumping to rendezvous with the rest of our convoy. You're invited to join us, Alpha."

6658, "That won't be necessary, Comfort. The GVD Memphis broke out of the nebula with a small fleet in tow. As soon as we picked up your distress calls, Admiral Nekba sent us out to find you."

6659, "The Memphis? We thought you guys were as good as dead out there. After the Shivans broke through the Ionia's blockade, they overwhelmed every rallying point between here and Capella. We've had no contact with Command ever since."

6660, "Neither have we. Comfort, we're going to transmit some new coordinates for you to jump to, as well as the Memphis' current position. Jumping straight to the Memphis from here is simply too risky. Alpha 1, send them the coordinates."

6661, "Where are they right now? The convoy I mean."

6662, "Scattered. The Shivans found us again a few hours ago, and we broke into several smaller groups. There are four groups total."

6663, "How many ships are there in total, Comfort?"

6664, "Twenty-four ships. The first group's already entered subspace and will arrive here any moment now. The other groups are under attack, and it'll take too long for them to calculate new jump coordinates to the Memphis, so they'll jump here as well."

6665, "What? Alpha 1, we need to signal for backup. There's no way we could cover that many ships."

6666, "I'm already on it, Skips. We just gotta sit tight until reinforcements arrive."

6667, "Theta wing's down! Our escort is gone!"

6668, "Our internal structures are collapsing! This-"

6669, "The Comfort has been destroyed!"

6670, "Damn it, that last hit knocked out auxillary power in Ward C! We've got patients flatlining!"

6671, "We've lost a transport!"

6672, "No! Not like this-"

6673, "Wilkins here! Our drives have recharged. We're getting the hell out of here!"

6674, "Alpha, where are you?! We won't last long under this sort of fire!"

6675, "Alpha wing, this is Iota 1. We're escorting a group of freighters. Can you lend us a hand?"

6676, "Roger, Iota. Moving into escort formation now."

6677, "Atlantic here. Drives are recharged. Thanks for the cover, pilots."

6678, "This is the GTFr Atlantic. We're under fire out here!"

6679, "Our transport's on the verge of breaking apart! We are not going to make it!"

6680, "Mayday! This is the GVG Anjet requesting assistance! Our convoy was destroyed and we are its only survivors. The Shivans are pursuing us! Please help us!"

6681, "Alpha 1, we can't leave the Anjet defenseless!"

6682, "Preserver here. We got the coordinates for the GVD Memphis' location. Our convoy will depart in five minutes."

6683, "This should be the last group of ships in need of assistance. We need only to fight on just a little bit longer."

6684, "Goose Green to Preserver. We're powering down engines to make emergency repairs to our reactors. Keep that convoy rolling forward."

6685, "Can't you push on just a bit more, Goose? We're only one jump away from allied forces."

6686, "Negative. We're already running a risk of a reactor meltdown if we push her too hard."

Five minutes ago we picked up a partial distress call from the $f GVD $f Hedetet$|. They are located approximately 700,000 kilometers from the $b Capella jump node.

6743, "$g Alpha, $f Beta and $f Gamma wings, you will be deployed to secure the area and establish contact with the $f Hedetet. To keep the location of our fleet concealed from the $h Shivans$|, the $f GTA $f Almagest will be deployed with their own fighter cover some distance from the $f Hedetet$|. They will act as both on-site command for this operation and relay information to the $f Memphis$|."

6744, "The Admiral has authorized the $f GVCv $f Sopedu to provide support during this operation. Although risky, the presence of AWACS vessels at both the $f Memphis' and $f Hedetet's location should mask the corvette's signature and keep our fleet hidden for the few remaining hours that we intend to stay. Unfortunately, the $f Sopedu is undergoing heatsink maintenance on their primary cannons. Captain Ipu's engineers are hastening their work, but the $f Sopedu will not be ready to jump for another ten minutes, and our other warships cannot jump while they are undergoing more meticulous repairs.

We have pre-selected your ships, though you may adjust your loadouts. Be quick, as the $f Hedetet does not have much time left."

6745, "Today was a tragedy, pilots. The loss of the GVD Hedetet and its complement of nearly ten thousand officers and crew is a painful blow to both the 11th Battlegroup and the Vasudan people. The Emperor will surely be pained to learn of this loss, given the decades of service this ship had accumulated. The actions of Vice-Admiral Mekh and his crew, who volunteered to remain behind to stand against the oncoming darkness, embodied what it truly meant to be an officer of the GTVA. They will be missed.

Your escort of the Ra-class escape pods provided a glimmer of hope, however. Not one of the escape pods launched from the Hedetet was lost to Shivan fire. A headcount has turned up 102 survivors, and a number of data drives and other records of the Hedetet's recent combat operations were preserved. These souls are in your debt.

Alpha 1, for your skilled command which protected all eight escape pods from a determined Shivan attack, I am awarding you the Allied Defence Citation.

Eta and Tau wings' attack on the SD Andromalius has uncovered a new cause for concern in this nightmare-incarnate. The crystals of the Andromalius' forward beam emitters seemingly hardened as they came under attack by the Hedetet's pilots. We will have to take this worrying development into account when we encounter this warship again."

6817, "I'm picking up reactor coolant leaking from her hull. Structural collapse of multiple compartments. It's a miracle she's still holding out given the damage she's sustained."

6818, "I have heard a great many stories about the Hedetet. The ship fought its way out of drydock upon completion during the Battle of Vasuda, and has served both the Emperor and the Vasudan people with great accolades. A warrior from birth."

6819, "And here she is, dying because she stayed behind to cover a bunch of stragglers who'd otherwise already be dead. At least this time we can save some of her crew..."

6820, "You still got the taste of blood for the Andromalius, right Skips?"

6821, "Don't we all? That destroyer challenges us at nearly every turn, as if we stole something important from it. I don't think we're gonna have any other choice but to confront it before getting out of Gamma Draconis."

6822, "Yeah, I've gotten that same feeling too..."

6823, "Pilots, we're tracking an inbound subspace signature. Likely a Shivan corvette. Stand by to interdict."

6867, "Almagest, I regret to inform you that Vice-Admiral Mekh was severely injured in that last attack. He is being moved to our infirmary as we speak. He was unresponsive when they took him from the bridge."

6868, "Understood, Hedetet. We're gonna get you guys out of there. Transports should be on station in five minutes."

6869, "This is Lambda 1. We are loading casualties onto our ship. We will launch with the second wave of evacuees."

6880, "Eta and Tau wings, what are you doing?"

6881, "We will flee no longer, Sopedu. By taking out those beam cannons, we very well may spare other ships in the fleet the Hedetet's fate."

6882, "By the prophets! Our weapons have no affect on the destroyer's guns!"

6883, "Launch preparations for the first wave of escape pods is at 50%. Buy us as much time as you can, pilots!"

6884, "I'm counting eight pods. How many can fit inside one of them, Alpha 4?"

6885, "A Ra pod can accommodate around a half dozen individuals, though in dire circumstances such as this, they can fit maybe fifteen."

6886, "That's... not a lot. Don't Typhon's only carry twenty of them?"

6887, "They often do, though they some times may carry less. Crew preservations often comes secondary to the safe evacuation of important records and data. This is a policy that has remained unchanged for centuries."

6893, "Fear not, Vice-Admiral. The Memphis has already recovered the survivors you were protecting. Admiral Nekba will be pleased to know that you and your ship are still with us."

6894, "Perhaps not for long, I am afraid. The Hedetet is a doomed ship, and with the survivors recovered, my only concern left is the safe retrieval of my crew and our databanks."

As most of our resources will be spent for the push on the $b Capella node, these craft should offer you enough firepower to complete this mission. $g Alpha will be flying these craft while $f Beta is tasked with escorting you.

It should be noted that Shivan convoys entering from the nebula may coincide their arrivals with the cruisers you are tasked with destroying. While not the focus of this mission, you may engage these vessels should they enter the area. Be advised that too many warships breaking through your lines may compromise our assault on the $b Capella node."

6910, "Once the cruiser threat has been eliminated, an attack on the $h SD $h Ascalaphus will commence. The $f GVCv $f Sopedu$|, held in reserve specifically for this attack, will jump in along with $f Epsilon wing and engage the vessel's port side. Your mission at this stage will be to destroy the $h Ascalaphus$|, thus removing a second threat to our ships. Prioritize disarming beam weaponry before engaging the destroyer in earnest. The $f Sopedu will not stand for long against the primary beam cannons of this warship, and the loss of the corvette will force us to abort our attack against the destroyer. Long range scans have indicated that multiple squadrons from the $h Ascalaphus have warped out from the area, with the majority of them heading to the $b Capella node to presumably reinforce the defences there. This should leave the few wings remaining to defend the destroyer with little in reinforcements. 

One $y Nephthys support ship has been allocated for your use. We only have a handful of these craft remaining, so be mindful when using this craft during combat."

Fortunately, one of our sensor clusters detected the $h SD $h Andromalius patrolling the outer regions of the system, and a targeted strike to cripple the warship will be launched as other operations commence. This destroyer poses too much of a threat to our fleet, but spending the resources required to defeat this foe will leave us with insufficient strength of break through the $h Shivan gauntlet at the node. The $f 988th has been tasked with this important mission.

Our squadron achieved most of its goals today. Not only did we take down the SD Ascalaphus, but we also prevented a sizable number of cruisers from uniting with the Shivan fleet here in Gamma Draconis. It is with pain that we are unable to share this victory with the crew of the GVCv Sopedu. A review of your flight logs show that there was nothing your could have done to save the Sopedu. Ultimately our actions have left the Shivans with only two destroyers in-system -- the weakened Daityas and the Andromalius. The sudden arrival of Rear Admiral Kamak's task force, while surprising, is a welcome development as well. However, Admiral Nekba has asked for our squadron to maintain secrecy of this topic until the time of his discretion. I expect that you will not discuss this outside of this room.

For your excellent performance in this mission, Admiral Nekba has hereby awarded you the Distinguished Flying Cross. Not only did you strike at Shivan logistics, but you also destroyed every single cruiser that crossed the jump node from the nebula before they could disperse and attack our fleet. Well done, pilot.

However, our fortune today ends there. The Shivans launched a savage attack, driving back the Memphis, Maahes and Syracuse from the Capella jump node. Over 60 pilots lost their lives in that engagement, including 45 spaceframes. The 988th Squadron was completely destroyed while trying to delay the Andromalius, which went on to lead the counterattack at the Capella node before diverting to your field of engagement. With the Shivan armada not far behind us, it is only a matter of time before we are overwhelmed. Thousands of lives are depending on us to get them back to safer space. We must not fail, else all our losses -- our sacrifices -- will have been in vain.

The Admiral will soon be addressing the fleet."

6926, "We have lost. It is only a matter of time before the Destroyers come for us.

We failed to protect the GVCv Sopedu.  If we had disarmed the Ascalaphus sooner, the Sopedu would still be here. In addition, our attack on the Capella node encountered fierce resistance.

The Admiral has ordered all pilots to be on jump five duties. When they come for us, we will fight them to the last ship, to the last missile, to the last Vasudan and Terran.
"

6927, "We have lost. It is only a matter of time before the Destroyers come for us.

While the Admiral has said that the strong Shivan presence in Gamma Draconis prevents us from breaking out, I personally believe that our squadron is responsible for this. We could have prevented those cruisers from reaching the Capella node. We may now even have been back in Alliance-held space if we accomplished our mission.

7014, "Shit! The Nybbas is gone! Memphis, do you have a vector?"

7015, "Affirmative, Alpha 2. We will sortie an anti-turret strike for her arrival. Maintain that line, pilots. We can not afford another cruiser to slip past you!"

7016, "Got another Cain inbound from the node. You know the drill! Hit them hard!"

7017, "We have failed to prevent the Karnatoth from escaping."

7018, "Tighten that defence, Alpha wing! We won't have the firepower to continue this offensive if another cruiser escapes your area of operation!"

7019, "Excellent work team. The Karnatoth has been nullified."

7020, "Rakshasa-class cruiser Cerberus on sensors with fighter escort. Two freighters as well. Is this the last one, Memphis?"

7021, "Affirmative, Alpha 2. Nullify that cruiser as soon as possible. The freighters are likely heading elsewhere in the system, so consider them secondary targets."

7022, "The Cerberus is going down! Break now!"

7023, "The Cerberus jumped!"

7024, "We will deal with that cruiser, pilots. Continue with the operation."

"

7033, "Arensnuphis, we need to cover them before it's-"

7036, "Understood. Helm, turn us towards the SD Andromalius and divert all power back to spinal beam cannons. Sa Vasuda, Arensnuphis. Tell His Majesty Khonsu II of our stand against the darkness."

7037, "What?! Alpha lead, we can't just leave them to die!"

7038, "Now's not the time, pilot! Everyone, you heard the Rear-Admiral. Move it!"

7039, "All personnel, this is Captain Ipu. You have served the Emperor well-"

7040, "Shit! The Ascal is rolling to bring undamaged weaponry to bear on the Sopedu. Alpha 1, we've got to take that beam down!"

7048, "Pilots, you will maintain cover of the GVCv Sopedu until their drives have recharged. The Admiral is executing Contingency BULWARK. Our attack on the Capella node has failed, and we are covering the retreat of allied warships to a new rallying point."

7049, "Admiral, we only need a few minutes to recharge our jump drives. We can still press the offensive!"

7050, "Friendly configuration! I repeat, friendly configuration! All units, stand down!"

7051, "What the hell? I thought the Arensnuphis already withdrew with the 13th to Capella."

7052, "Captain Ipu, this is Rear Admiral Kamak of the Arensnuphis, 13th Battlegroup. I must request that you immediately put me into direct communication with Admiral Nekba."

7053, "Affirmative, Sir. Establishing a secure patch for you with Memphis Actual. Pilots, the Sopedu is forming alongside the convoy. Stay close to us."

7054, "Roger that, Sopedu..."

7055, "<secure channel> So... this sortie just got interesting."

7056, "<secure channel> The Arensnuphis must be escorting something pretty important. Hey, Alpha lead. You getting this? My sensors can't read those cargo containers."

7057, "<secure channel> Hmm. I am having the same issue as well. It would appear that those TSC 2 containers has been de-registered. They must be with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence."

7058, "<secure channel> Most peculiar. The Argo transport is shielded against scans as well. What are they carrying, I wonder."

7059, "<secure channel> Must be important for it to warrant a Sobek escort, AWACS support and two wings of spooks. I've never seen those fighters before either."

7060, "<secure channel> Yeah. Here's a kicker -- I'm reading strong EM signatures from their weapons. Computer's giving me both Terran AND Shivan signatures."

7061, "<secure channel> Shit. That's a bit unsettling..."

7062, "Negative, Captain. The Daityas still stands and the Andromalius has arrived and is closing in fast. The Syracuse has withdrawn and the Maahes has already suffered moderate damage. The Memphis will not survive much longer if we stay."

7063, "Negative, Captain. The Daityas still stands and the Andromalius has arrived and is closing in fast. The Syracuse has fallen and the Maahes has already suffered moderate damage. The Memphis will not survive much longer if we stay. "

7064, "Understood, Memphis. Sopedu clear."

7065, "Pilots, cover us while our drives recharge. We'll jump to the rally point and regroup with the Memphis there."

7066, "Pilots, we are detecting multiple subspace disturbances from the nebula jump node. Prepare for contact."

7067, "What? They want another bloody nose?"

7068, "Talk to us, Sopedu. What are we looking at?"

7069, "Unable to determine. Stand by."

7070, "The Ascalaphus' hull has fallen below critical stability. Maintain bombardment."

7071, "Multiple fires have broken out in the central decks. Damage control team have been deployed."

7072, "This is the Sopedu. We are under heavy assault. Alpha, we must end this fight now if we are to succeed!"

7073, "We're working on it as hard as we can!"

7074, "Engineering reports faulty surges along the conductors of one of our primary beams. Powering down starboard spinal beam."

7075, "There is no activity from the Ascalaphus' fighterbay. I believe we have eliminated their garrison wings."

7076, "Excellent. Time to clean house with that big bastard."

7077, "A Shivan convoy of transports and freighters have warped in. They are considered secondary targets."

7078, "Scratch that convoy off the board. Good shooting everyone."

7079, "Alpha, Gamma wing is available for tasking. Call them in if you need them."

7080, "That's strange. I'm picking up below average passive energy readings from the Pytho's weapons."

7081, "It would appear we have caught the Shivans off guard. Use this as an opportunity to strike them as they exit the node before they can fully power their guns!"

7082, "Woah! Careful guys, the Pytho's guns are firing at full speed!"

7083, "Convoy ships are going REALLY hostile! Watch out for those flak guns!"

7084, "The Nybbas' got a lock on us! Evade!"

7088, "Our hull has been compromised! We are going down!"

7089, "Abort mission! I repeat, abort, abort!"

7090, "GTC Audacious now on station and ready to intercept hostile arrivals. Gunnery, power up our beam cannons and get those fusion mortars ready."

7091, "Damn! We've taken some good hits. Sorry, but we're pulling out of here before we're nothing more than slag. Audacious out."

7092, "Audacious here. We're withdrawing back to the flotilla's position as planned. Good luck, pilots."

7093, "Copy that, Audacious. Thanks for the assist."

7094, "Alpha, the beam cannon on that cruiser will rip our hull to shreds. Take it out pronto!"

7095, "<secure channel> There is nothing to be alarmed of, Alpha 3."

7096, "<secure channel> What the-... uh, a-affirmative, sir. Sorry, we uh, weren't aware you could hear us."

7097, "<secure channel> Your apology is not needed, pilot, for it is I who should apologize for eavesdropping on your wing. That being said, I would not have done so without reason."

7098, "<secure channel> If I may ask, but what would that would that reason be, sir?"

7099, "<secure channel> Alpha 4, are you not Prince Nehebu?"

7100, "<secure channel> Did... I just hear that right?"

7101, "<secure channel> You did, Skips..."

7102, "<secure channel> I am, Rear-Admiral. Why do you ask?"

7103, "<secure channel> I was merely curious, Your Highness.I have studied Terran speech extensively, and your wingmates seem to be...surprised by this revelation. Have you not told them who you are?"

7104, "<secure channel> I...I did not, Admiral. I chose not to."

7105, "<secure channel> I see. From what I have gathered, you have always wanted to forge your own destiny, yet are forever shackled to the life of the Imperial Dynasty. It is a difficult place to be, if I may observe, for I too faced similar challenges from my own clan."

7106, "<secure channel> I appreciate your understanding, Admiral. If I may inquire, but we were not expecting any further allied ships to arrive from the nebula. What were you doing out there?"

7107, "<secure channel> I am afraid I can not divulge the exact nature of our operation, as per GTVI protocols pertinent to clearance level Omega. However, I must thank you and your wing for creating an avenue of escape for my ships."

7108, "<secure channel> I shall leave you and your wing to your own. Kamak out."

7109, "Seriously? I thought the whole point of this operation was to get out of this damned place, not run away!"

In fifteen minutes, our fleet will begin a final breakout attempt from $b Gamma $b Draconis$|. There is no more time for us to waste, as long-range scans have detected a massive deployment of additional $h Shivan forces from the nebula. The $h Sathanas may be in-system within the hour."

7115, "Sathanas 02"

7116, "The $f GVD $f Memphis will move out from its current position and engage two $h Shivan warships on patrol near our location, the $h SCv $h Demiurge and the $h SC $h Sabazios$|. The $g 36th is to provide fighter cover for the $f Memphis in this operation, while also assisting with beam disarmament. Pay special attention to the $h Sabazios$|, a $y Lilith$|-class cruiser which mounts a destroyer-grade beam cannon."

7118, "Demiurge"

7119, "There is no doubt that our strike will attract $h Shivan attention. Once we have nullified the immediate threat, we anticipate the Shivans will sortie increasing numbers of fighters, bombers and warships against the $f Memphis$|. Our goal is to stand against every challenge the Shivans throw against us. We will beat back every fighter sweep, every mass-bomber attack, every warship shock-jump that the Shivans can muster. Expect them to sortie whatever forces they have in $b Gamma $b Draconis that are not blockading the $b Capella node."

7120, "We are to keep up this offensive until the $h SD $h Andromalius appears, at which point we will hold down the destroyer at our position at all costs. We will exploit a weakness in the $h Andromalius that one of the 988th's pilots discovered before they were overrun. This exploit is in the form of small fractures between its reinforced armour plating. The main guns of the $f Memphis should be able to deal critical damage to the $h Andromalius by hitting these weak points.

Because the Andromalius' main beam emitter crystals have displayed an immunity to conventional attacks, we will prioritize covering the $f Memphis at this stage of the operation from additional $h Shivan attacks. The $h Andromalius and $f Memphis will duel alone."

7121, "While the $f Memphis engages the $h Andromalius$|, the $f GVCv $f Arensnuphis will lead the rest of our warships in an all-out assault on the $b Capella jump node. With the exception of our squadron, the entirety of the $f Memphis' remaining air wing will partake in protecting the warships, freighters and transports of the fleet during their run. There they will engage the $h SD $h Daityas and the remnants of the blockade force. So long as we keep the $h Andromalius away from them, surviving allied units will make it to $b Capella and reunite with the $f GTVA$|.

Although our warships will be engaged at the node, we will not be leaving the flotilla undefended. The $f SOC wings that were accompanying the $f Arensnuphis will remain with the flotilla at a safe location to guard them.

The $g 36th will cover the other squadrons docking with the $f Memphis before we ourselves land. If the $h Andromalius has yet to be destroyed by this time, then we can expect them to follow us to the node. We may only have a few minutes to gather our remaining craft before we make the jump. However, the $h Shivans will deploy numerous forces even if the $h Andromalius is not present. We will be making a fighting retreat right up to the $f Memphis' fighterbays."

7126, "Andromalius?"

7127, "Because this will be a lengthy operation, our wings will deploy in stages. $g Alpha and $f Delta will be initially sortied. Your wings will provide space superiority and intercept during our assault against the $h Demiurge and $h Sabazios. $f Beta wing$|, flying heavy assault, will launch once $h Shivan reinforcements join the battle. $f Gamma and $f Epsilon wing will reinforce the $f Memphis' defence upon the $h Andromalius arriving in the battlespace.

Our squadron has also received special authorization to use the $y GTW $y UD-8 $y Kayser$|, an experimental weapon that only SOC units and some CEU squadrons have access to. This cannon is powerful, and you will undoubtedly find it of great use in the coming battle.

7129, "This is it, pilots. I wish good fortune to all of you, for now it is time to show the $h Shivans what the $g 36th is truly made of!

Get to your ships!"

7130, "Welcome back aboard the GVD Memphis, pilots.

We have won today. With our victory over the SD Andromalius, all Shivan forces in Gamma Draconis have withdrawn to the vicinity of the jump node leading to the nebula. Although Allied Command has indicated that no offensive will be launched to retake this position, we can take some comfort knowing that the Andromalius will terrorize us no more.

Our forces are withdrawing to Capella, where the 3rd Fleet and other allied units are mopping up the remaining Shivan vanguard force. Although the Memphis is in an urgent need of repairs to several of her structures and systems, engineers report that she should be able to make the jump to Capella in one hour's time. The GTD Messana will remain on station to provide cover for us, and they will join us in Capella as soon as their mission here has concluded. Our time in that system will be short, however, as only minor repairs will be conducted before the Memphis and the rest of our fleet head for Epsilon Pegasi. Command has ordered the creation of a provisional unit, the 32nd Battlegroup, to assist the Terran 6th Fleet in defending Epsilon Pegasi. This unit will consist of survivors from both our fleet -- including Terrans such as yourselves -- and the remnants of the 6th Battlegroup, led by the GVD Zednanreh. We will rendezvous with the Zednanreh in that system and undergo more extensive repairs at Enif Station.

I have been informed that Admiral Nekba personally spoke with Emperor Khonsu II shortly ago, and you should know that our squadron was a focal point during their discussion. I am pleased to announce that for your heroism in the face of darkness, and for your diligent service to the Alliance, all pilots of our squadron have been inducted into the Imperial Order of Vasuda. This is a truly historic moment, as never before has an entire squadron been awarded this great prestige. Congratulations, pilots.

The 36th Orbos-Gak will undergo a well-deserved, mandatory rest period once we have departed Gamma Draconis. You all have deserved it. Dismissed!"

7131, "Thank you for playing Shepherds!"

7132, "With the destruction of both the GVD Memphis and the GTD Messana, the GTVA had suffered their greatest defeat in the war up to now.

This defeat would soon be dwarfed in the coming days..."

7133, "Stay close to the Andromalius as you engage its sensors, as this will keep you out of its flak coverage. If the SC Deumus is present, destroying its anti-fighter beam would help."

7134, "The GVD Memphis was lost with all hands, taking with it one of the Alliance's finest crews. The Andromalius would go on to destroy the force attacking the node, and shortly thereafter, hunt down the surviving GTVA forces in the system.

No one would know how close they came to escaping."

7135, "With the exception of the Sabazios, the Memphis can handle most warships. Focus on the bombers and keep on the move to intercept them.

When you encounter the Andromalius, stay close to it as you engage its sensors, as this will keep you out of its flak coverage."

7208, "Affirmative, Memphis. We will strike the Daityas as soon as we have received your command."

7209, "<secure channel> I still feel conflicted about not having told you all who I was. You said that you had forgiven me, but..."

7210, "<secure channel> It's all right, Nehebu. After your last squadron you only wanted to make sure more wouldn't die. That's what you meant back on our first op, right?"

7211, "<secure channel> Indeed. Commander Phrem was reluctant to send me out on combat sorties after my transfer. I feared that my death would not be in fighting the Shivans, but rather as a grounded pilot. I can not stomach the thought of doing nothing during a time of great need."

7212, "<secure channel> Hmm. I knew there was something strange about that interaction between the two of you."

7213, "<secure channel> My elder siblings never understood my desire to branch out of Imperial life. I am fortunate that my father was understanding, and allowed me to pursue this life despite his concerns."

7214, "<secure channel> So, what do you all think of the odds stacked against us? I've heard some of the other pilots say this was a suicide mission."

7215, "<secure channel> Not good, but it's not like we've got a lot of options either. A whole lot of people are depending on us to get them back home. Just in case things go south though, I want to say that it's been an honour to fly with you guys."

7216, "<secure channel> On the contrary, I believe we will prevail!"

7217, "<secure channel> Always the optimist, eh?"

7218, "<secure channel> Optimist? Sure. But I know we will succeed! Much like the stories of the Wandering Prophet of ancient Vasuda, who led the Abrak-Keta clan to salvation from the Great Storm, I believe we will complete our mission and return to allied space!"

7219, "<secure channel> I hope you're right, Nehebu. I really do."

7220, "Pilots, the jump drives of your fighters have been slaved to the Memphis' own drives. We are now preparing to depart and engage a pair of Shivan warships nearby. Brace yourselves for battle."

7221, "Activating jump drives now!"

7222, "We have the Shivan warships on sensors - the Moloch-class corvette Demiurge and the Lilith-class cruiser Sabazios. We are now commencing plasma core insertion."

7223, "The Memphis will be subjected to intense bombardment if we leave those beam cannons intact. We should prioritize those threats, Alpha 1."

7224, "Arensnuphis, be advised that we just begun engagement with the Demiurge and Sabazios. We will notify you when the Andromalius arrives. May good fortune guide us all on this day."

7225, "Affirmative. All squadrons and warships are assembled and awaiting the Admiral's command. Sa Vasuda, Memphis."

7226, "Enemy vessels have taken notice of us and are turning to engage us. We are also detecting a fighter launch from the Demiurge. Draw those fighters into our anti-fighter beams, pilots."

7227, "That corvette's just launched a wing of bombers. Intercept them before they hit the Memphis!"

7228, "We have destroyed the Demiurge."

7229, "The Sabazios is going down. "

7230, "All bandits have been neutralized, Memphis."

7231, "We are under heavy assault, but our armour holds. Tighten that cover, pilots!"

7232, "Decks 7 and 21 are reporting hull breaches and we have lost all contact with section 10! Damage control units are being deployed to affected areas, and engineering teams will repair as much damage as possible!"

7233, "Incoming jump signature! The SCv Jinn has emerged to our starboard side."

7234, "Stand clear of the Memphis and the Jinn, or you're gonna get friendly-fired!"

7235, "Memphis, you've got a Cain at close range just below your bow!"

7236, "Acknowledged, pilot. We are engaging the SC Sabinock. Destroy its beam emplacement if you get the opportunity."

7237, "The Jinn's beam cannons are inflicting a considerable amount of damage. Pilots, you must disarm that warship immediately!"

7238, "The Sabinock has been destroyed!"

7239, "We have nullified the SCv Jinn."

7240, "Woah! Great shot Memphis! The Andromalius is dead in the water!"

7241, "All wings, form up alongside us! The Admiral is bringing us in for the kill."

7242, "Urgent! Urgent! Memphis, this is the Arensnuphis! Our battlegroup has been surrounded at the Capella node and we have lost most of our fighters! I repeat, a breakout is impossible without additional support!"

7243, "Arensnuphis, we are unable to come to your aid. Our secondary drives are still cooling down and we are currently engaged with the SD Andromalius!"

7244, "All units, this is Admiral Nekba. I have reassessed the situation. The Memphis will immediately redeploy to the Capella node. Our diversion will have been for nothing if we can not successfully return to allied space."

7245, "Admiral, we are so close to destroying this bastard! We just need a few more minutes!"

7246, "Our warships at the node do not have a few minutes, pilot. We have achieved a mission kill on the Andromalius - our fleet should be in Capella by the time they repair their engines. Form up with the Memphis, we have Shivan reinforcements inbound."

7247, "Memphis, Alpha 2! Some of us can split off and head for the node. We need those warships!"

7248, "Even if you destroy the Andromalius, you will have no fleet left to assist in breaking through the blockade! You must disengage! There is no time to spare!"

7249, "Gunnery, disengage primary and secondary beam cannons. I want as much power diverted to our primary jump drive as possible. We run the risk of overloading our reactors, but we have no other option."

7250, "All units, prepare for jump! 3... 2... 1..."

7251, "There she is! Andromalius on sensors!"

7252, "Contact with Andromalius confirmed. Notifying the Arensnuphis to begin their run for the node. We are launching Epsilon wing now. All pilots, stay close to the Memphis!
"

7253, "The Memphis is maneuvering to bring our main guns to bear. Commencing ECM attack on their targeting! Gunnery, target the following locations on the Andromalius' hull! Triple strike pattern! This is it!"

7254, "That ECM better work..."

7255, "Detecting a surge of energy from the Andromalius's cannons! The destroyer is firing in 3... 2... 1..."

7256, "Gunnery control, open fire!"

7257, "Those shots missed!"

7258, "The enemy retaliated with their own ECM attack against our targeting systems. Stand by for mission update."

7259, "The Andromalius is launching fighters! Designation Sagittarius!"

7260, "This is the Memphis. The Andromalius' ECM attack seems to have originated from their sensor subsystem. Hitting that subsystem should weaken them and give our targeting systems an opening."

7261, "Alpha wing, close in and hit that subsystem! Be advised that we are detecting minimal activity from the destroyer's fighterbay. Expect further enemy attacks to originate from subspace. We estimate the Andromalius will break through our ECM in 3 minutes!"

7262, "You heard 'em, Alpha 1! Let's get in there!"

7263, "This is Epsilon 1! Additional Shivan fighters are jumping in! We will protect the Memphis, Alpha 1!"

7264, "Acquiring lock! Firing!"

7265, "We have another lock! Gunnery control, fire!"

7266, "Severe degregation of enemy ECM detected! Open fire!"

7267, "The Andromalius will be within firing range in 90 seconds! Continue your attack!"

7268, "Press the attack! The Andromalius will be firing in 30 seconds!"

7269, "Come on!"

7270, "Sagittarius wing is approaching on an attack vector! We must fight through them!"

7271, "Two Rakshasa cruisers inbound! They're flanking the Memphis!"

7272, "She can't fight back! We've got to take out those beam cannons!"

7273, "Affirmative. It would appear the Andromalius is attempting to reach the Capella node, but our last attack compromised their navigating capabilities."

7274, "The Andromalius will fall out of subspace between here and the node. All craft, we're activating our secondary drives and following that warship. Prepare for subspace transit!"

7275, "Activating jump drives in 3... 2... 1... Now!"

7276, "The Andromalius is jumping out! Memphis, do we know where the hell she's going?"

7277, "Jump flash... holy shit..."

7278, "How is that possible?! Memphis! The Andromalius is warping in!"

7279, "Uhh guys are you seeing this? What the HELL is that thing?!"

7280, "Whatever it is, it does not bode well us. We are picking up a massive amount of energy emanating from within that destroyer."

7281, "This is the Admiral. Negative, Alpha 2. Pilots, you will break off from your escort and head for the fleet. The Memphis will divert all remaining power to our thrusters and beam cannons. We will hold back the Andromalius for as long as we can."

7282, "The Memphis is going down! I repeat, the Memphis is going down!"

7283, "Pilots, Taurus wing, consisting of 3 Aeshma-class fighters, appears to be armed with EMP ordnance. Be careful when engaging them."

7284, "We are picking up four Seraphim-class bombers on approach. Intercept those warheads before they hit us!"

7285, "They have a wing of Manticores escorting them to the Memphis! We can not let them tie us down!"

7286, "It has begun! Hostile fighters incoming!"

7287, "Here they come! Don't let 'em through!"

7288, "Roger! Let's take them all down, Alpha lead!"

7289, "Shit! Got Dragons on the scene, designation Virgo! Don't let them get a bead on you!"

7290, "Ugh! We'll try our best!"

7291, "The SC Ogre has warped in. All units, engage the Shivan cruiser."

7292, "The Ogre's going down!"

7293, "Enemy cruiser neutralized. May the souls of the Syracuse rest easier now that their killer has been banished to oblivion!"

7294, "Woah! Friendly configuration jumping in from Capella. It's the GTD Messana!"

7295, "Allied forces, this is the GTD Messana! Hang tight, reinforcements have arrived! Diomedes, assist us in taking down the Daityas!"

7296, "Messana! This is the GVD Memphis! We are sending you critical targeting data on the SD Andromalius! "

7297, "Area's clear. Damn, that was intense. Take a moment to catch your breath, guys."

7298, "Memphis, you got anything on scope?"

7299, "Affirmative, Alpha 2. One target, destroyer-scale. ETA is one minute. Our ECM suite is online. We will await confirmation before signaling the Arensnuphis to begin their attack."

7300, "Rearm if you need to. It looks like that showdown's about to happen, and experience tells me this isn't going to be an easy fight."

7301, "It won't, but we're not letting that bastard stop us, no matter what! Not one more ship!"

7302, "Affirmative!"

7303, "Area secured, but we are picking up multiple inbound jump signatures. All fighters, prepare for contact."

7304, "Wait a minute! She's breaking off her attack!"

7305, "The Andromalius may be attempting to shield its weak points. Stand clear of the destroyer while we attempt to reacquire a lock with all of our cannons."

7306, "It's breaking apart! The Andromalius is breaking apart! We did it!"

7307, "Energy signature rising! The Andromalius' reactors are unstable! We must get away now!"

7308, "Hit those burners! GO! GO! GO!"

7309, "HOLD ON!"

7310, "Holy... we're all still here, yeah?"

7311, "Alpha 4 here. The energy released by that explosion was nearly comparable to that of a meson bomb. Absolute insanity!"

7312, "This is Charge. Alpha 1 looks fine, too. Man, I don't even want to think what would've happened had that thing fired those cannons."

7313, "The SD Andromalius has been destroyed! Messana, we are picking up numerous outbound jump signatures. Are you getting these?"

7314, "Messana here. Affirmative, Memphis. Long range scans are showing a full-scale withdrawal of Shivan forces towards the nebular node. We should be in the clear for the time being."

7315, "Memphis, this is Allied Command. What is your status?"

7316, "You know, I can't tell if I'm happy or disappointed to hear Command's voice again."

7317, "This is Admiral Nekba speaking. The danger has passed, but the Memphis will not be withdrawing to Capella without emergency repairs to our engine arrays."

7318, "In the meantime, we have a flotilla of transports, freighters and medical vessels that will be transiting the node. My pilots shepherded these souls to safety. They would not be here without them."

7319, "The GTT Merrick is already in subspace with a damage control team aboard. We will arrange an evacuation plan for those survivors once they have arrived in Capella. Excellent work keeping them safe."

7320, "We will deploy additional wings to escort your fleet to the node, Memphis. No offence, but your pilots look just about done in."

7321, "This is Memphis Tactical. The Messana will handle CAP duties. Starting with the 36th, you all have permission to return to the Memphis. The fighterbay is ready to receive you. You have all done a great duty today. Memphis Tactical out."

7322, "Well, that was a hell of a ride. I dunno if it'll be our last time flying together, but it was great flying with you, Nehebu. We wouldn't have made it this far without you."

7323, "And I thank you as well. We have made quite a team together, and we have made the Shivan pays dearly for the lives they took these recent days."

7324, "Watching that damned thing go down... it's hard to describe. I think those we lost along the way may finally rest in peace. I'm glad we made it happen. Thanks for getting us out of hell, Alpha 1."

7325, "All units, we're launching a wing of four Mara-class fighters. Do NOT engage these ships. Repeat, Mara fighters taking off are friendly."

7326, "Messana, Snipes here. We're off the deck and getting ready to jump to the node. Keep the lights on. We'll be back in time for supper."

7327, "Roger that, Skulls. Good luck out there."

7328, "We're gonna need it where we're going. I just hope our drives can get us back to Gamma Drac before they break down. Jumping out now."

7329, "If a support ship has jumped out with your squadron while attempting to dock with you, you may need to reorder them to rearm you."

7330, "With the Messana, the fleet will surely be safe! We should strike at the Andromalius!"

7331, "Memphis! Do we still go for the fleet? Are we attacking that thing?! We need an update, damn it!"

7332, "Belay that order! Pilots, we will let the Andromalius plague us no longer."

7333, "The Memphis and the Messana will strike at that monstrosity, but the Andromalius is jamming both of our destroyers' beam target aquisition systems. We need you to destroy its sensor subsystem immediately!"

7334, "Shit! We've got no time to waste! Everyone, high-tail it to the Andromalius!"

7335, "We are rotating the Memphis to permit the Messana's beams a path towards the enemy. By the Prophets, this had better work..."

7336, "Sa Vasuda..."

7337, "No... after everything we've done..."

7338, "This is the GVD Memphis! Arensnuphis, what is your status!"

7339, "We are just barely holding them back, Memphis! The SD Rangda and SD Xaphan jumped in a few moments ago and are closing in! We need you to help us break this blockade, or we are all lost!"

7340, "We will try to reach you, Rear-Admiral, but the Memphis is on its last leg! Our reactors are on the verge of imploding! We need several minutes to cool down our engines!"

7341, "Admiral Nekba, I know you can hear me! So much more hangs in the balance than our mere fleet should we fail to reach Capella! Nexus can not fail!"

7342, "I'm seeing it too. I think it's charging up its beam cannons! Alpha 1, we've gotta take that thing down before it-"

7343, "I... fine! Everyone, you've heard the Admiral! Break off from the Memphis and head for the fleet!"

7344, "Full throttle it and-"

7345, "Excellent work, Alpha 1! We have completely broken through their jamming! Messana, prepare for joint salvo fire! Firing in five... four..."

7346, "Three... two... one..."

7347, "FIRE!"

7348, "Shivan fighters incoming! We've gotta push through them!"

7349, "The Ravana's guns will fire in one minute! We must hurry!"

7350, "Alpha 1! We're almost out of time!"

7351, "No! The Messana's going down too!"

7408, "While it is a shame that we were unable to nullify the original target, my task force's mission of studying the nearby subspace anomaly yielded much for your analysts to sift through. The Shivans clearly did not want us to escape with this data, given the opposition our forces faced from the Andromalius and its fleet."

7409, "We have only begun to scratch the surface, but already this data appears to vindicate Project Olympus. Combined with the PVN's findings nearly a century ago and the GVSC Seshat's discovery last year, I believe the Security Council will finally give Olympus the attention it deserves."
