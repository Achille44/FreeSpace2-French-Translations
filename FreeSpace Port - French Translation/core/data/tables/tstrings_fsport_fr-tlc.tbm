5271, "(fr)In accordance with one of the terms of the alliance, the GTA must help the Vasudan Parliament eliminate the rebellious group known as the Hammer of Light. Vasudan Intelligence suspects that the main headquarters of the Hammer of Light is somewhere in the Antares system. The GTA is sending forces to help the Vasudans find this base."

5272, "(fr)New Technology:

  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device. This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.
  The device first finds the nearest GTA communications beacon in the system. It then sends its coordinates to that station through a contained subspace portal. All of the equipment is contained in a sensor-shielded container to prevent detection. The SHB is simply a long-range homing device."

5286, "(fr)Well done. You managed to defend the cargo area from both the Hammer of Light and the Shivans, and you let the freighter escape with the SHB. Hopefully the freighter will take its cargo to the Hammer of Light base,  and then we can launch an assault on them. This is a very big step towards eliminating the Hammer of Light."

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.

Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more. Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems. While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues. With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athènes. Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''Nain Blanc'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''. The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet. Congratulations pilot. Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5451, "(fr)Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot. Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

5452, "(fr)Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destinée on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space. Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy. Omega One contains a drone pilot and no passengers.."

5460, "(fr)If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit. Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni. If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node. On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda. Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports. Dismissed."

5461, "(fr)Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destinée intact despite considerable resistance. Nice work."

5462, "(fr)Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous. Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump. This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

5467, "(fr)We realize that things got pretty rough out there. However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive. With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

5468, "(fr)Keep your team close by on this mission. Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault. Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland. Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5469, "(fr)However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING! The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history. Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5470, "(fr)The Destinée, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son. You must eliminate this threat immediately. If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destinée to do the work."

A deeper investigation reveals that the ship's captain, John Wallace, is responsible for misleading the Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency to believe the merc force was being funded by HARC. He has coordinated every attack from his flagship and must be brought to justice.''"

To all hands aboard the Nepenthe. If you've read today's Command briefing then I assume you are frightened. So am I. We have been branded as traitors, and the GTA will throw everything they have at us. I assure you all that I did not send that communique. We have moved the Nepenthe into the shadows of the Casa belt. The joint council needs to know the treachery the Vasudans employed in order to win Mandala Prime. Report for briefing in 20 minutes.
Capt. John Wallace (GTD Nepenthe)"

Under any other circumstances, I would have ordered this craft captured. However, we don't have that luxury right now."

5629, "(fr)Although we didn't have much time to hail the Alexander Bell, it appears that our message was going through. Unfortunately, the communications outpost was not responding. Since we are so far away from our home system, we will need to relay our message off of the Alexander Bell."

The Vasudan fleet is mobilizing in Manda to begin colonization of Mandala Prime. Colonization will begin tomorrow at 0700 hours."

5650, "(fr)The rogue destroyer, the GTD Nepenthe has managed to evade the GTA. Apparently, the Destroyer and her crew attacked a Vasudan science vessel which was studying the effects of asteroids on radio transmissions. This outrageous slaughter has enraged Vasudans and Terrans alike."

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communication station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus. The outpost has been shut down and all transmission from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destinée."

5652, "(fr)As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a ''virus outbreak''. We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command. A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

5653, "(fr)Alexander Bell"

5654, "(fr)The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters. Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

5655, "(fr)We know the workers on the outpost are not suffering from a virus. We believe that the Admiral has reconfigured the radar dish so that the Bell cannot communicate.
Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish. Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

5656, "(fr)Our long range scans indicate that a their is some sort remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar. Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell. Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

5657, "(fr)I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing. Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly. Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared. If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

Apparently, the Vasudan empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA, and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime. Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded. The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destinée has already begun evacuation."

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives. The GTA is not about to forget this. The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance. However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire. On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime. We will start our own colonization today."

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war. If this happens, then may God be with us all. While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war. This planet is made for Terran life. Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime. Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void. We WILL take this world."

Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live. This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.

However, I can guarantee you no more than ninety seconds until the Captain is on to the fact that it is you flying that Ulysses.

Terran intelligence believes he is planning to give this information to the $h Hammer $h of $h Light. Vasudan intelligence has confirmed this belief.

As Arjuna can easily call in reinforcements if necessary, Alpha's primary objective will be to provide a distraction for $h Arjuna.

6222, "(fr)You did a fine job protecting the Omega transports, despite the fact not all the freighters escaped. While we could have used those extra supplies, what we escaped with will simply have to do."

6223, "(fr)Congradulations! Omega successfully retrieved the cargo and escaped the area undetected. The supplies in those cargo containers will allow the GTC Weaver to repair its communications systesm, and bring us one step closer to escaping enemy territory."
