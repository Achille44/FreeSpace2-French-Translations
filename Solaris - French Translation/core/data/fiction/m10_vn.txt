MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "Stuart. I don't know what state of mind you're at right now, but it was important that I sent this. Important to you, and to me." 5788 "10a-09"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "I want to apologise for not telling you about being in ANI. I understand if you're still angry. I would never have kept it from you if it wasn't necessary." 5789 "10a-10"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "You told me it's like you can't trust anything I say anymore, but I've never lied to you directly. Everything I've told you, where I'm from, my family back home, it's all real." 5790 "10a-11"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "ANI recruited me when I applied for the Federation exchange program. The whole time on Artemis I was an intelligence agent. Pace was my case officer." 5791 "10a-12"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "I had to keep it secret, Ross. I couldn't blow the operation. No one could know about it, not even friends like you. I hope you realise this, now that you've seen what's happening." 5792 "10a-13"

MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3447 "Our duty to the Crown sometimes requires us to sacrifice our values for the sake of the country. I hope that we haven't had to sacrifice our friendship too." 5796 "10a-17"
