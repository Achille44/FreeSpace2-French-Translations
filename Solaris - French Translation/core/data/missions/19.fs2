    XSTR("This is Commander Cameron to the crew of the Hopewell mercenary group.

We can confirm the arrival of Covenant and her attending ships at the rendezvous. All ships are accounted for, with no casualties reported.

Unfortunately the efforts of Navo's marines to apprehend the crew were unsuccessful. The freighter crew were clearly on a suicide mission and had contingencies in place in the event of capture. There was not enough left of their bodies for a clear identity verification. We have sent the remains for DNA matching.

We have compiled a report for Fleet Command regarding the events of today. I plan to especially highlight the contributions of Lieutenant Stuart Ross who was crucial to the neutralisation of the nuclear attack.", 4523)
