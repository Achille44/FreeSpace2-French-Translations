16003, "GTVA Air Combat Manoeuvring 1-0-0: Introduction to ACM Fundamentals

CH 1: Introduction

The importance of brevity and a common operating picture of terminology cannot be overstated during ACM. All aircrew should ensure they are conversant with the below terms and can recall their meanings under significant cognitive duress. 

AFATADS: Advanced Field Artillery Targeting and Direction System. Refers to the network and target acquisition architecture used by all GTVA vessels to produce firing solutions with both long-range missile and beam weapons systems. Forms spine of the TAG system. Also allows target acquisition by GTVA spacecraft for select ordnance types from platforms such as the GTF Ares. 
As Fragged: Wing/Ship is performing action as per the Air Tasking Order. I.e. as ordered. 
BLUFOR: Blue force. Refers to friendly forces.
BRAA: Bearing, Range, Altitude, Aspect. Taken from 21st Century ACM vernacular, BRAA is the format that all contact calls are relayed by AWACS and Mission Command controllers. E.g. Contact, fighter wing, 120, 2 kilometres, low, hot. Bearing and altitudes given relative to the receiving callsign axis.
Bracket: Manoeuvre where friendly fighters will position on opposite sides of a target. 
Commit/committed: Ship/Wing intends to engage specified target.
Contact: New sensor contact.
Cold: Given wing/ship is heading away from friendly ships. Opposite of Hot. 
Cleared Hot: Ordnance release is authorised.
DAMCON: Damage Control teams aboard a given vessel.
Defensive: Ship is manoeuvring defensively with respect to an active threat. E.g. Alpha 1 defensive!
FENCE In/Out: Refers to cockpit switches being set for in/out of combat. Mnemonic for Fire-control system/ECM/navigation/communications/emitters. 
Fox: Missile launch. Fox 1-Semi-radar guided missile. Used when target is being acquired by another ship, such as through the AFATADS interface. Fox 2-IR guided missile, such as the MX-64 Rockeye. Fox 3-Radar guided missile, such as the GTM-4a Tornado. 
Grandslam: All hostile spacecraft of a given formation have been destroyed. 
Guns: Laser fire from friendly spacecraft.
Heavy: Refers either to heavy assault/bomber variants, or a wing of more than four ships. 
Hot: Given wing/ship is heading toward friendly ships. Opposite of Cold.
Merge: Friendly and hostile ships now in same visual arena.
Popup: Radar contact that has suddenly appeared inside of a specified range.
Press: Directive to continue attack, mutual support will be maintained.
Rifle: Torpedo launched from friendly bomber.
Ripple: Two or more munitions fired in close succession. 
RTB: Return to base.
SATCOM: Satellite communications array. Primary radio communication means for all alliance vessels.
Separate/Separating: Given wing/ship is departing the field of engagement. 
Spike: Enemy radar lock warning. 
Splash: Enemy craft destroyed. 
SPOTREP: Spot report. Used by reconnaissance units to transmit sightings of enemy high value targets.
Tally: Enemy ship sighted.
Visual: Friendly ship sighted.
Winchester: No ordnance remaining."

16004, "Fire Control Orders"

16005, "Capital Ship FCOs are the verbal format by which Battle and Assault Group commanders call for beam fire on designated targets. This is generally executed at the beginning and end of ship-to-ship engagements in order to synchronise beam fire from independent ships. They follow the format GROUP-TARGET-TYPE OF FIRE-NO. SALVOS. 

An example may be: Battlegroup, reference the Ravana, beam-fire, cross-fire, three and three. Fire when ready! 

In this instance, the battlegroup target is the SD Ravana. The commander directs for beam cannons to be employed in a cross-fire pattern, aiming to have all beams intersect a given point to maximise damage. This is as opposed to frontal-fire which gives freedom of fire pattern to each vessel commander. Three and three stipulates three bursts with three seconds in between. This is the standard opening salvo for most ship-to-ship engagements.

Aircrew should always monitor the FIRES NET during ship-to-ship engagements so that they can avoid beam fire where possible."

16013, "The Morena MacDuff is a singular act of tenacity and hubris. Built by the Gaian Effort Kostadin Cell, still faithful to the ecoterrorist agenda of its leader, the MacDuff began its life as one of the modified mining ships that ferried Fringe Alliance citizens to their new homes in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. The Gaian Effort grew out of Reverend Iain MacDuff's generosity in these days, and, in turn, the warship Morena MacDuff grew out of the gradual disintegration of MacDuff's dream.

As those who had turned to MacDuff for protection and salvation splintered into numerous cells, many diverging from his agenda, MacDuff armed the Morena and used it as an enforcer. Over the decades, Kostadin Cell has expanded the ship by accretion, adding new armor, weapons, and power systems in a cascading and almost biological growth. Confined to a few carefully plotted jump points by the subspace hazards of the Solar periphery, the MacDuff looms as a symbol of Kostadin Cell's hardline politics and MacDuff's madness.

The vessel is named after MacDuff's beloved wife, whose remains are rumoured to be enshrined deep in the bowels of the warship. With the Reverend MacDuff now nearing 150 years old, his ship - patchwork, unpredictable, barely sustained by constant attention - seem a fitting totem. Her current status is unknown, as the increasingly cultish Kostadin Cell protects her reverentially."

16017, "TO: All, GTVA 13th Battlegroup
FROM: ADM Severanti, Cyrus

SUBJ: OP FORTUNE - Commander's Guidance

To the officers and crew of the GTVA 13th Battlegroup,

At 0200 hours this morning, contact was re-established with the GTVA 14th Battlegroup - now under the command of Admiral Morian. Preliminary reports indicate that since their initial loss of communications, the 14th has been engaged in heavy combat whilst defending the Sol$slashDelta Serpentis node. Casualties across the fleet number in excess of 45%. 

The forces opposing them have identified themselves as members of the United Earth Federation - a humanist group that overthrew the GTA, and now control the Sol system. My N2 Cell have prepared a number of intelligence products for the widest dissemination amongst the battlegroup that explain what we now know about the UEF. I strongly recommend every member familiarise themselves with this analysis and understand consummately why we are now undertaking combat operations into the Sol system. As you will read, the absence of the Shivan threat to Sol played a significant role in shaping its development during the Separation and led directly to the de-legitimisation of the GTA in that system. 

You will read of wide-scale defections across the 14th Battlegroup, including Admiral Bei, and the vessels Labouchere, Duke, and Miranda. Whilst a tragic day for the Alliance, we must take solace in the fact that our mandate is in providing security for the systems of the Alliance from a third Shivan incursion. Anything that threatens that is fundamentally incompatible with our way of life. My staff will release an Operations Order shortly that will explain our initial actions. Expect that this will involve direct combat operations in support of the 14th.

To conclude, I ask that you revise and place faith in your training and equipment. We are the Alliance that bought humanity a second chance in its destruction of the Lucifer, and then again at the Battle of Capella. The weight of humanity's security rests squarely upon our shoulders once again. Take pride in this.

Today, we deploy to Sol.

Kind Regards,

Admiral Cyrus Severanti
Commanding Officer

GTVA 13TH BATTLEGROUP INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SITUATION:

- At 06 0745 MAR 2385, SOC ELINT Teams achieved listening watch on Sol communications traffic over HF$slashSATCOM means. Presence of non-GTA government in Sol confirmed. Hostile intent to GTVA unconfirmed. Status of GTA elements unknown.

- At 01 0230 APR 2385, GTVA 14th Battlegroup deployed to Sol in accordance with Phase 1 of OP FORTUNE. SATCOM contact lost immediately following subspace transit. 13th and 16th Battlegroups recalled and placed on 2 hr NTM. Deployment to Sol on order. 

- At 04 0800 APR 2385, SATCOM contact re-established with GTVA 14th Battlegroup in vicinity of Sol node. XO 14th Battlegroup reported hostile contact with Earth forces. Parent formation reported to be UNITED EARTH FEDERATION. Destruction of 1x Earth warship confirmed. 4x Earth warships currently in contact. 45% Casualties reported within GTVA 14th Battlegroup. Surviving warships maintain position at node. XO reports CO 14th Battlegroup defected with a number of Principal Staff Officers. Duke, Labouchere, and Solace defected wholesale to UNITED EARTH FEDERATION. Temeraire and Miranda combat ineffective due to crew defection. 

- At 04 0845 APR 2385, SOC ELINT Teams report mobilisation of 3x FLEET-sized formations. Warship classes: unknown. Preliminary jump vectoring shows concentrations in vicinity of Mars, Jupiter, and Earth.

ASSESSMENT: 

- Lack of Shivan threat to Sol system resulted in wholesale delegitimization of GTA mandate to govern. Fracturing of key institutions followed.

- Legitimate GTA government subsequently dislodged by radical group referred to as UNITED EARTH FEDERATION in vicinity years 2370-2375. Authority derived from economic rebuilding of Sol following post-Lucifer Separation. Common values derived from pacifistic, isolationist political mandate. Key leadership group centred on ex-GTA leadership, known as Council of Elders. Led by individual Martin Mandho. 

- UNITED EARTH FEDERATION is HOSTILE to GTVA elements. Risk consequence to own force posed: CATASTROPHIC. INCOMPATIBLE with GTVA government. Re-integration must be enabled by defeat of FEDERATION. 

- UNITED EARTH FEDERATION is staging up to FLEET sized formation in vicinity of Jupiter. Likely for counter-attack on Sol node in order to SECURE against GTVA follow-on forces.

N2's assessment is that this will be the Federation's likely staging area, which Rock has now designated Objective Neptune. Capturing it will seize the initiative for the alliance, and give us a forward base to begin staging deeper into the system. 

I know it seems surreal to be talking about strikes into Sol, but this a situation none of us could have dreamed of. Our only hope is to clear the rebel Federation as quickly and cleanly as possible, and then begin the re-integration of Sol back into the GTVA. Our families are out there somewhere, and if fighting a few rebels is all we have to do to get them, then we can count ourselves lucky.

1. A light space superiority fighter, GTVA reporting name: FENCER. Comparable in manoeuvrability to the Kulas. Has at least two primary gun-mounts and likely to have internal missile banks.

2. A light interceptor, GTVA reporting name: FULCRUM. SOC have observed that it's similar to our Perseus. Has at least one belt-fed gun-mount and likely to have missile banks too.

3. A heavy assault fighter, GTVA reporting name: FOXHOUND. Appears to lack manoeuvrability - comparable to our Ares. Has at least four gun-mounts and at least one large secondary bank with attachment points for external missiles.

Our task will be to destroy $r CruRon $r Alpha. The $g 532nd are a good outfit, and they should tie up the majority of the escort fighters, allowing us to pick off any stragglers and assist with the destruction of the cruisers.

Once the $r FrigRon has been cleared, $g Assault $g Group: $g Nova will do the same on their flank. Once all callsigns are set, Rock will signal Colonel Natalie Hartmann, CO of the 1st Marine Regiment. They'll arrive in Argo transports and commence securing each installation in the objective. Once they jump in, we'll conduct a handover with the $g 545th, and land back on the $g Meridian and debrief. 

A simple plan, reliant on violent execution to work. If the bombers don't make it in, the Battlegroup will get destroyed before they get in beam range. If we let the fighter screen open, Federation bombers will get in close, fire torpedoes at close range, and cut the Meridian to shreds. We saw it at Vega, we saw it at Capella, and we'll see it here in Sol if we don't play our positions and play them well. But if there's a squadron that can do it, it's the $g 312.

16057, "We all in Reiji? Thanks.

We fought well out there today, but it just wasn't good enough. Those Federation pilots had our number from the second Mustang hit the merge. We did our best under trying circumstances, and we failed.

From here? Rumour has it that Rock wants to continue reconsolidating at the node. Wait for another battlegroup or something, and then potentially have a crack at Neptune again. We know that the UEF are massing forces there now, so the next time we fly might be defending what little is left of the Meridian.

We paid a heavy price today, pilots. Take a look in the Wardroom over dinner. CAG let slip that we lost over 35 aircrew from this ship alone today, with 10 more wounded. For those of you itching for action...well, you got it. Go get yourselves showered up. We've just got to keep moving forward now. "

Once the UEF begin sortieing strike packages against the left flank of the battlegroup, speed is of the essence. You can equip Trebuchets to break up UEF gunship formations outside of their effective missile range, and attempt to destroy incoming warheads to give the Harpy a better chance of survival."

16059, "We all in Reiji? Thanks.

Today was an absolute slaughter. 10,000 Officers and crew perished today, because we didn't do our fucking jobs. I pride myself on controlling my temper most of the time, but I can barely look any of you in the eye right now.

If you think the flight-deck of the Hood sucks, and we shouldn't be debriefing here, then I want you to think about what it must have been like when your flagship exploded outwards from its reactor-core and vaporised you from the inside-out. Think about those 10,000 people who'll never see their families or friends again. That's 10,000 people who will never get to see our beloved Blue Planet.

I haven't received orders yet, but if we're going to have any chance of throwing this Federation out of the system and uniting the goddamn Alliance, we're going to have to lift our game across the entire fleet. Go get yourselves showered. And take note of every empty seat in the Wardroom tonight."

16060, "The Hecate is an aging design by the time the Battle of Neptune occurs, and the GTVA have not tested her in kinetic operations of this scale since the Second Shivan Incursion. As a result, she is outclassed easily in this engagement.

You can increase her survivability by supporting Trident Squadron where possible, as the quicker the CruRons are destroyed, the less time she spends under incoming torpedo and gauss cannon fire. You can equip Maxim$slashTrebuchet weapons systems to assist Trident with destroying enemy weaponry, such as mass drivers, gauss cannons, and torpedo launchers to give the Meridian a fighting chance.

Once the UEF begin sortieing strike packages against the battlegroup, speed is of the essence. You can equip Trebuchets to break up UEF gunship formations outside of their effective missile range, and attempt to destroy incoming warheads to give the Harpy a better chance of survival. Ensure you waste no time when utilising AFATADS."

16061, "Once the UEF begin sortieing strike packages against the flank of the battlegroup, speed is of the essence. You can equip Trebuchets to break up UEF gunship formations outside of their effective missile range, and attempt to destroy incoming warheads to give the Nakatomi a better chance of survival."

16062, "Take a knee pilots. We've still got fighters coming in, so keep your helmets on.

For those of you who've just posted in, I'm Captain Stephanie Merino, currently serving as the CAG. I wish we could've met under better circumstances, but meeting on the flightdeck is often the way of things, and certainly the way in war. 

Today has been a costly day for the Meridian. The 501st took 30 casualties alone, with the 532nd losing 10, with 4 MIA. The 591st, the 545th, and the 312 all took heavy casualties as well. Every death is a tragedy, and it is one that we'll mourn in time. Spare a thought for each of them as you walk past their landing bays, and see the empty chairs in the Wardroom tonight.

But that's not why I've ambushed you on the flightdeck like this. For our first engagement with the United Earth Federation, battle tracking in the CIC has initial estimates at over 42 confirmed kills, four cruisers, and two frigates. We may have taken a few blows today, but we doled out far worse than what we received. And that is a credit to your flying, pilots. We may have lost a lot of good pilots today, but we produced far more in the forge of combat. Remember what you have learned, and teach it to those who come after you. If this is an indicator at all for how the rest of the war will continue, then they will certainly need it.

Admiral Severanti sent his official sitrep to 2nd Fleet HQ seconds before I came down here - I can confirm for now that the 13th Battlegroup will be holding position while the 16th assumes lead. Our immediate future looks like Rear Area Security Operations until the damage is repaired and replacement pilots rotate in. For now, the 60th off the Nova are flying CAP for us, and you're all on forced rest from now for the next 72 hours - after you debrief with intel. Take that time to relax, reflect, and prepare for what comes ahead of us. It won't be easy, but it will be necessary to take us closer to that Blue Planet. 

As you were."

16063, "Bomber doctrine at this stage of the war has not yet had the chance to mature from combat experience for the GTVA. Bombers like the Rhea and the Artemis were designed for unescorted operations against Shivan cruisers - not well developed engagement areas serviced by long-range flak cannons and well-coordinated close air support. While they absorb point-defence fire well enough, they are easy prey for fast, highly manoeuvrable spacecraft such as the Kentauroi. You can enhance their survivability by targeting the Kentauroi wings first, or at least tracking them so that they do not saddle up on your bombers for too long. 

Additionally, once the escorting fighters are down, you can support your bombers by targeting the point defences of the frigate and her cruisers. Altering your loadout to Maxim$slashTrebuchet weapons systems will enable you to do this with ease. 

The 532nd's small and manoeuvrable Kulas fighters are horribly mismatched against the UEF's fighters, and there is nothing you could have done to save them.

There was nothing you could have done to save Alpha 1. "

16064, "Ensign Rahman? Nice work getting back here, we thought you were a goner. I'm Captain Stephanie Merino - the CAG. These aren't exactly ideal circumstances to meet under, but any landing you can walk away from is a good one. Take a seat with the other pilots here, if you want.  

Alright! Today has been a costly day for the Meridian, pilots. The 532nd lost 10 pilots, with 4 MIA. The 501st, the 591st, the 545th, and the 312 all took heavy casualties as well. Every death is a tragedy, and it is one that we'll mourn in time. Spare a thought for each of them as you walk past their landing bays, and see the empty chairs in the Wardroom tonight.

Admiral Severanti sent his official sitrep to 2nd Fleet HQ seconds before I came down here - I can confirm for now that the 13th Battlegroup will be holding position while the 16th assumes lead. Our immediate future looks like Rear Area Security Operations until the damage is repaired and replacement pilots rotate in. For now, the 60th off the Nova are flying CAP for us, and you're all on forced rest from now for the next 72 hours. Take that time to relax, reflect, and prepare for what comes ahead of us. It won't be easy, but it will be necessary to take us closer to that Blue Planet. 

As you were."

16065, "Bomber doctrine at this stage of the war has not yet had the chance to mature from combat experience for the GTVA. Bombers like the Rhea and the Artemis were designed for unescorted operations against Shivan cruisers - not well developed engagement areas serviced by long-range flak cannons and well-coordinated close air support. While they absorb point-defence fire well enough, they are easy prey for fast, highly manoeuvrable spacecraft such as the Kentauroi. You can enhance their survivability by targeting the Kentauroi wings first, or at least tracking them so that they do not saddle up on your bombers for too long. 

Additionally, once the escorting fighters are down, you can support your bombers by targeting the point defences of the frigate and her cruisers. Altering your loadout to Maxim$slashTrebuchet weapons systems will enable you to do this with ease. 

The 532nd's small and manoeuvrable Kulas fighters are horribly mismatched against the UEF's fighters, and there is nothing you could have done to save them.

There was nothing you could have done to save Alpha 1."

SUBJ: PRIVATE - Delta Wing

Hey Nash,

I've just redone the flight roster. You're gonna fly Delta 2 now. 

Nathan's head hasn't really been right since that Argo went down right next to him. I don't know if he got concussed from the explosion or whether the guilt is eating him up, but he hasn't looked like he's slept in the last three days and he barely eats in the Wardroom. 

I'm cutting you across to him because he needs a good 2IC, and you impressed me on that last sortie. You're still a nugget, but you're learning, and he needs someone good to back him up out there. Make sure you support him, and support his decisions. He's a good Wing Leader, he just needs some time to get his head screwed on. 

See you when I see you.

16729, "Delta Wing, this is Command. Search and Rescue are currently deployed at the Epsilon Pegasi node. We will advise you once they are available for re-tasking."

16730, "<INTERNAL> That's fucking bullshit!"

16731, "Command, he's wounded and bleeding out fast, can you give us an ETA?"

16732, "The soonest we can provide is 10 minutes, Delta Wing. Command out."

16733, "Fuck! Lieutenant, can you hear me? Your suit will self-seal, but if you need to, you can apply a tourniquet as well. Remember, it's sewn into your left arm pocket - can you reach it?"

16734, "I'm...sorry I froze. I'm just so fucking tired."

16735, "Don't worry about that Nate! It's going to be alright, is your suit sealing? Do you need a tourniquet? "

16736, "It was my fault, it's my fault they're dead."

16737, "Come on, man! Put the fucking tourniquet on! Once that SAR bird arrives you're going straight home!"

16738, "Nate? Nate? Sir?!"

16739, "Shit. Nash, I'm not picking up any updates from his suit. I think he's unconscious. "

16740, "Damn it, we've just got to hope his suit self-seals in time."

16741, "What do you think the Shivans will do to him if they find him like this?"

16742, "Same thing they did to Bosch and his crew. We've got leave someone here with him."

16743, "WARNING: GTVA DISTRESS BEACON. DOWNED AIRCREW. 
GR: BP 5124 8106. 
SPEED: 0 M$slashS.
CAT A: UNCONTROLLED HAEMORRHAGE, 500> ML"

16744, "1 - Tell Delta 4 to stay with LTJG Austin
2 - Tell Delta to leave LTJG Austin and defend the convoy"

16745, "Right. Four, stay here with him. Three, come with me. We've got to keep defending the convoy. We're getting too far away already."

16746, "Roger Nash. I'll stay with him until SAR show up."

16747, "I don't know if this is the right call man. I've flown with Nate since I got here but I don't know if two fighters will be enough to defend that convoy."

16748, "Look, we've got to continue the mission. There are thousands of people on those transports and we need to get them to Vega. Once they jump we can go back for the LT."

16749, "Are you being serious right now? You want us to leave a pilot alone in fucking SPACE with genocidal aliens here? What the fuck is wrong with you Nash? I hope this is the last time we fly together if that's the way you're going to treat me if I eject."

16750, "He's right, Bec. That's the mission. We had a hard enough time finding Nate here, the Shivans will be too focused on the convoy to find him. "

16751, "Incoming jump signature, hostile configuration!"

16752, "Two Lillith cruisers and multiple fighter wings! What do you want to do, Nash?!"

16753, "Kamil, hit the forward beam cannon of the Kratos! I'll take the Zavara."

16754, "And the fighters?"

16755, "Command, this is Delta Wing of the 312, our convoy is under attack from two Shivan cruisers and multiple fighter wings! We are completely outnumbered! Request additional fighter and bomber support!"

16756, "Delta Wing, this is Command. I am transferring your request to the GTD Vengeance. Please standby."

16757, "Cyclone's Wing are still back there, maybe they can help?"

16758, "May day, may day, may day! We are detecting multiple incoming missiles! Where are you Delta Wing?!"

16759, "Speargun Delta, this is Vengeance Tactical. We are deploying Alpha Wing to assist. ETA five minutes."

16760, "Targeted! Fox three, snapshot! Let's turn and burn, you motherfucker! "

16761, "Five minutes?! We won't have a convoy left in five minutes, Tactical!"

16762, "Beam cannon neutralised! My HUD's lighting up like a Christmas tree, engaged defensive! Multiple fighters on my six!"

16763, "Nash! Where the fuck are you?! Nash! Nash?! Nash! Help me! "

16764, "Beam cannon down! "

16765, "Oh my god, Kamil's gone. Nash, I'm on the way! What's the ETA on Cyclone?"

16766, "Vengeance, where the hell is that fighter cover?!"

16767, "We've had a fatality on the flight deck here Delta, ETA is still five minutes."

16768, "Fuck!"

16769, "Oh my god, Kamil's gone. We can't tangle forever, Nash - where's Cyclone?!"

16770, "I'm engaged defensive! Need a hand here Nash, she's right on me now!"

16771, "Nash, I'm hit! I'm hit! Oh gods-"

16772, "Omicron 1, reactor core breach imminent! "

16773, "The convoy! God-fucking-dammit! Hartig, come in?! Omicron? Anyone?!"

16774, "Speargun Delta, this is Alpha Wing. What's your status?...What the fuck? Nash? Where the fuck is everyone else? Where's the convoy?"

16775, "Lieutenant Austin ejected, I've marked his location. Three and four went down as well. It was a fucking bloodbath, Cyclone."

16776, "A fucking bloodbath, and yet you survived by yourself did you?"

16777, "What?"

16778, "What the FUCK happened here Nash?! You were meant to be flying Nate's wing to help him, and now we've lost the whole convoy AND the wing?"

16779, "They jumped us with two cruisers and a whole squadron! Nate was down by the time they jumped in, we didn't have a chance at all, Cyclone!"

16780, "Don't use my fucking callsign, nugget! No one survives a $quotebloodbath$quote on their own unless they're the ones who cut and run first. I'm sending you back to Vega after this - I can't trust any pilot who'd turn from the fight and leave the rest of their Wing to die."

16781, "This is Nighthawk, 48th Rescue Squadron, Special Operations Command. I heard you guys have a downed pilot here?"

16782, "Nighthawk, Delta 2 of the 312th, it's good to see you. We've got a pilot down, location marked. He's lost consciousness but we think his suit sealed in time. "

16783, "Roger. Don't you worry, we'll get to work on him soon. Recovery team are hooking up now."

16784, "Delta, I couldn't help but overhear your traffic during the infil. The thing about flying fighters is that the only person you're responsible for, is you. Second place in our game is a GTVA flag on a casket, and first place is the privilege of breathing. You won today, pilot."

16785, "I put you there to support the goddamn Wing Leader, Nash, and now he's bleeding out in space and his wing is dead. In what universe is this not your fucking fault?"

16786, "You were the Commander after he punched out! And you had a goddamn responsibility to Kamil, to Bec, and to Nate - to get them home alive. Not to mention every passenger on that convoy!"

16787, "Recovery Team exiting the airlock now."

16788, "None of that changes the immutable realities of this job. It is simple. Do the basics well, and you'll get another landing in your logbook. Forget them, and space will be your tomb. We're the masters of our own destiny out here in the expanse, Alpha."

16789, "4-8 X-Ray, at the casualty. He's Cat Alpha, no signs of life. Major arterial haemorrhage, right arm. Prepping him for recovery now. "

16790, "Goddammit Nate. God-fucking-dammit. "

16791, "I didn't turn from any fight! Watch my fucking cockpit footage!"

16792, "The Kratos is charging her beams! Going full power to burners, I'm almost there! "

16793, "The Kratos is about to fire her main beam! All hands, brace for impact!"

16794, "The Zavara's beam cannon is online! Helm, hold steady! We're going to get through this Omicron, just a little longer!"

16795, "Command! The Zavara is charging her main beam cannon! The convoy is being overrun - we need support NOW!"

16796, "This is Omicron 2, the hull's coming apart! Evacuate the bridge - get off the fucking bridge NOW! "

16797, "Delta 2, engaged defensive!"
