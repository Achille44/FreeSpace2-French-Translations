MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Ross. Don't mind me. Just thought I'd vent for a bit." 5819 "18a-01"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "I'm going to fly out there with you and Meiks today. We're short on pilots. I know how to handle myself if it came to a fight, so don't worry about me." 5820 "18a-02"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Erikson's a capable crewman. I know she'll take good care of the Hoshikuzu but this still rubs me wrong." 5821 "18a-03"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "It's annoying. I should be there on the bridge when the fight comes. I want to, I mean. But Erikson's capable, she knows what she's doing. I know I'm needed more in the cockpit." 5822 "18a-04"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Reverend Lightowler assures me everything will be fine. I wish I had his serenity. But then I don't have the luxury of having the Lord on my side." 5823 "18a-05"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Feels like one of these days I'll run out of luck. You push Fate for long enough, her debtors'll come knocking." 5824 "18a-06"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "I suppose we've got some good people with us. Navo will be running ops on the Nassau. Kaur is itching to try out the Hoshi's weapons upgrades. And we've still got you and Meiks out there to save the day." 5825 "18a-07"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "If there's anyone that can get through the storm that's about to hit, I suppose it'll be us right? We've been through some rough spots before this. If we're still here it means we're doing something right." 5826 "18a-08"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "If our time comes maybe the karma we'll earn for helping these refugees might even count for something." 5827 "18a-09"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Sorry Ross. Been feeling philosophical nowadays what with everything. I wasn't expecting any of this when I decided to go into merc work." 5828 "18a-10"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "I suppose I'm procrastinating having to confront my cousin again. I've decided to hand her over to the Commonwealth, have her answer for what she did at Kotus Anchorage." 5829 "18a-11"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Once we deliver these refugees to the Children of Renewal, we'll find the nearest Commonwealth port and give Kendra to the Albans. It's the right thing to do." 5830 "18a-12"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Do you think I'm being too optimistic, planning too far ahead? Sometimes it's hard to look ahead what with all the things going on right now." 5831 "18a-13"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "But we've got to somehow, don't we? Life goes on around us even when everything seems overwhelming." 5832 "18a-14"
MSGXSTR "LAU" 5696 "Well, looks like work calls. The waystation sensor reports have arrived. I'll send the word when we're ready to launch." 5833 "18a-15"

MSGXSTR "NAVO" 5834 "While the Thanatos and her ships keep the Combine busy, the convoy will move to clear Vicare Station. Once at safe distance, the transports will jump out to rendezvous with the Renewal congregation." 5841 "18a-22"
MSGXSTR "NAVO" 5834 "For our pilots who haven't met Meiks and Ross, they're the two gunship pros from the Hoshikuzu. They'll be Alfa wing. Captain Lau is Bravo 1. Keep an ear out for her instructions and follow her target calls." 5842 "18a-23"
