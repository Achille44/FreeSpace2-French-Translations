4122, "First discovered by the Vasudans shortly after the Great War, Black Ash is the Shivan answer to resource collection, construction and reclamation. Nano-machines eat away at nearly anything, creating a dark black compound. This compound can be refined and formed to construct more specialized construction vessels. As terrifying a weapon as this could be, the Black Ash will avoid anything with an alternating current with a specific frequency running through it. It is believed that this is how the Shivans keep the Black Ash from overrunning their own ships."

With 8 dual flak cannons, it is capable of taking care of most fighter or bomber threats. Its two powerful engines allow it to keep up with any transport ship and almost match speeds with heavier fighters. When faced with a capital ship threat however, the Cretheus' only advantage is its small size and speed. Without any beam cannons and only light armor, the Cretheus must rely on heavier cruisers for survival. Cretheus Cruisers are typically in groups of two or three so that their spread of flak can cover more area."

4853, "Commander? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Captain White, Special Operations Command. Your little trip to Cagliari Station has certainly raised some eyebrows, and that is why I will be handling your debriefing instead of Commander Daniels.

You look tired, have you slept at all? Black- ah, how rude of me. This is my assistant, Lieutenant Black. He'll be recording our conversation as well as performing any clerical duties. Black, could you please go get our friend a cup of coffee? Thank you.

Now, this isn't your first debriefing for this incident. That's not unusual. Sometimes questions that should have been asked are not, or information that's given is shown as inaccurate or deceptive. Your story seems to hit a brick wall in your second trip to Cagliari station, where... you just don't remember anything.

I'll be frank, they told me they think you're lying. I think they're mistaken. I think they're afraid of what you may have seen, and I think you are, too. This is nothing to be ashamed of. When your brain encounters trauma, it shuts down and seals off access to the memory so it will never hurt you again.

If it was up to me, I would say, 'leave the poor sod alone.' We've got better things to do. But the thing is, is that we have hundreds of Shivan ships entering Capella. What you saw might give us a hint at what they're going to do or a way to beat them.

We need you to remember what you saw, but just asking your brain to unlock your memory isn't good enough. What I am going to do is ask you to recall what happened in the events leading to your second trip to Cagliari station. Now I know what happened already, but this is for your benefit.

Like picking a lock, we must slowly and carefully make our way through your memory. Ah, good, Lt. Black is here with your coffee. Please have a drink and tell us about your first trip to Cagliari Station."

The Carthage and her fleet have been put back on high alert. Civilian curfews are back in place and a shoot on sight order is in effect for unidentified ships. In other words, back to standard operations."

4916, "This little incident at that graveyard certainly put $y Command into a tizzy. The big question on the table is if the science cruiser $f Thevenin did anything to wake the Shivans up. But that's not our problem right now.

Our problem is going to be finding the Shivans and destroying them. And boy, do we have our work cut out for us."

4917, "Resource-wise, we're in the middle of a bubble. 

The $f Colossus is still in drydock from her recent battle with the $r Sathanas, and there's no chance she's coming out unless another Sathanas decides to rear its ugly head.

Command's got two fleets in the nebula and two more dispersed in the $h ex-NTF systems. So not too much left for us here other than what is already here. But we do have some forces coming in from $b Gamma $b Draconis so I think we've got a good chance at nailing these Shivans.

You $y 113th boys get the special job of helping the recon parties. Most of the other wings are being placed on standby near installations and convoys in case the Shivans attack. I can't quite tell if you're the lucky ones or not."

4918, "The system grid has tracked a number of subspace disturbances out in the $b Rossini $b sector. Initial analysis indicates ships exiting subspace. The largest disturbance might have come from a destroyer. This is the best lead we've got right now.

4936, "What a sad story. The Argus, one of the ships you were assigned to escort, was destroyed. Given your description of the battle, I might even believe it. But I don't think you're remembering this correctly.

Weren't you able to disable the beams on the Shivan cruisers fast enough? Maybe you should try retelling this again."

So what woke the Shivans up? Best guess right now is $v Cagliari station itself. The Argus' scans showed the jamming field was coming from Cagliari, but we don't think it's actually a jamming field. It's more like a flare of EM and subspace activity, but the effect is still the same to us. We can't see in from far away.

The enhanced sensors from a $f Charybdis or a $f Setekh are just about the only ways we can get a clear view in the area, and even then the Shivans just seem to be able to jump in on any vector. Not only that but the Shivans are repairing their ships and possibly even building more. A frontal assault would be costly, so $y Command's looking into other areas. First things first, disabling that field jamming our sensors."

5074, "While you hot shots were out dancing with the Shivans, $y Intel was digging up information about $v Cagliari station and why it was just abandoned right before the rebellion started.

Construction was being done by $y Strauss $y Construction, what we now know was a front for the $r Neo $r Terran $r Front. It looks like it was going to be a base for the NTF but they abandoned it when it became obvious they weren't going to have a hold in $b Capella. So they just left it.

The civilian transport manifests to and from the unfinished installation show a name that pops up quite often. $E Doctor $E Serge $E Rachmann. He was a researcher at $y Vega $y University, specializing in subspace communications. He joined the NTF, developing hardware to bust through our jammers."

5075, "Something's on that station and Rachmann is most likely connected to it.

Now I hope you all bought your lottery tickets, because here's where it gets good.

Intelligence last put Dr. Rachmann on the $r NTC $r Orpheus in $b Polaris. The Orpheus was seen entering $b Capella, but no records show she escaped our blockades or was destroyed. It's possible that they slipped out during the $r Sathanas' attack, but we've just received information that shows they're still in the system."

You can expect $y Hercules-class fighters and other older fighters. It is also likely you will engage transports and smaller sized capital ships.

The innocent lie because they don't want to be blamed for something they didn't do, and the guilty lie because they don't have any other choice.

We don't blame you for what the Orpheus did. There was nothing you could've done. Please don't try to impress me with your wild tales, I already know the truth. Think of it like this, don't tell the story to me, tell it to yourself. Why would you lie to yourself? It's not going to get you anywhere.

Why don't we start again?"

5096, "I don't mean to push, but that's not at all what happened.

Now think of it like this, don't tell the story to me, tell it to yourself. Why would you lie to yourself? It's not going to get you anywhere.

Why don't we start again?"

5097, "Death isn't really something that someone just... gets over. Maybe this whole experience has made you a bit unstable but you are alive and well.

Lets take a five minute break and then we can start again."

$E Doctor $E Rachmann has been quite forthcoming about the events leading up to now. We have prepared the following excerpts of his interrogation to help with some background for your next mission. The following is classified level $W Rho."

5396, "$W EXCERPT $W BEGINS
$W 3:55:32
$g Agent: So you were stuck in Capella.

$E Rachmann: Yes. We had heard the Colossus was at the Knossos. The captain didn't really want to go on a suicide run, so we began hiding in an asteroid belt. We were going to wait until things quieted down. Well, they didn't.

$g Agent: The Sathanas engagement.

$E Rachmann: Yes. However it would divide your attention long enough for us to make a get away. We decided to head to Cagliari station, we knew there were transports left there. And I knew that some of my work was still there. If anything I could continue my research, even in exile."

5397, "$g Agent: So just what was your work?

$E Rachmann: Bosch had come to me, enquiring about my research into subspace communications. He knew that I had done research into Shivan communication as well. He offered me archives from the GTI and more if I would construct him a transceiver that would theoretically be able to communicate both ways with the Shivans.

$g Agent: ETAK?

$E Rachmann: Only a component of it. Alone it can't do much other than make noise. There was so much more to ETAK than just machines."

5398, "$g Agent: So you went back to Cagliari station for your transceiver?

$E Rachmann: Yes. When we arrived, it was as dead as the day we left it. I took a crew with me to retrieve my hardware and stow it on a transport. But my curiosity got the best of me. The transceiver was still there. It was easier just to build a new one on the Iceni. I had wanted... wanted to see for sure if my work was a success.

$g Agent: And?

$E Rachmann: More than I could have possibly imagined. I turned it on and the transceiver spiked... I still can't fathom what actually happened. Something... came out of it, or we were drawn into it. I saw a white light, coming from everywhere. I could feel them.

$g Agent: Who? The Shivans?

$E Rachmann: Perhaps. The spike lasted for less than a second, but everyone near the transceiver went comatose. At that point the Shivans began to arrive and a team from the Orpheus came down to rescue us and leave everything else behind."

5399, "$g Agent: Who was affected by this... spike?

$E Rachmann: Myself, the captain and the team sent down to retrieve my equipment. Thirty or so people. We could feel the Shivans, and the Shivans could feel us. No matter where we jumped, the Shivans were there 5 minutes later. I had calculated the Res$slashInt pattern and found an area where we couldn't feel the Shivans.

$g Agent: Why were the Shivans after you?

$E Rachmann: Until a few hours ago, I thought they were trying to kill us. It was like we were holding flares on an open field at night. We were easy targets. But now... they sent transports to capture us. Maybe... they don't know what we are... And they want to find out.

$W EXCERPT $W ENDS"

5400, "Given what Dr. Rachmann has told us, we have come up with a plan to destroy the $h Vassago and its fleet in one fell swoop. To test Rachmann's theory, the $f Hyksos, carrying the surviving crew, will jump near $v Cagliari Station to attract the Vassago's attention."

5401, "GVCv Hyksos"

5402, "The Hyksos will then jump to several remote locations around the system. If the Vassago or its ships trail the corvette consistently, we will proceed with phase two."

5403, "Shivan Forces?"

5404, "Phase two will consist of luring the Shivans into a marked engagement zone. This engagement zone will be directly within the firing arcs of eight specially modified $y Mjolnir remote beam cannons situated 50 kilometers away. The $f GTD $f Carthage will be with the Mjolnir to provide targeting information and protection."

5405, "GTD Carthage"

5406, "Mjolnir System"

5407, "Shivan ECM makes it hard to acquire a lock on, especially from 50 kilometers away. $f Alpha wing will be in the engagement zone armed with $y TAG $y missiles to light up the Shivan capital ships. Alpha will fly $y Pegasus-class stealth fighters to aid their survival. The rest of the wings will hold back with the Carthage to protect the firing range."

5408, "The Mjolnirs require 30 seconds between shots to cool down. All the cannons will be linked together, so prioritize your targets. It will be just you and the Hyksos in the engagement zone. We can't risk any crossfire damage, putting the Hyksos in there is a big enough risk in itself.

Also keep in mind that whenever you $y fire weapons, the Shivans may be able to get a momentary target lock on you. $y Proximity may also compromise your stealth. The Pegasus is highly maneuverable so use that shining attribute to avoid fire."

5409, "Just remember, you're not in this to dogfight. Hit them hard and hit them fast. It won't take long for the Shivans to realize this is an ambush. Given their ability to quickly jump in and out of subspace, they may retreat or even engage the Carthage and the Mjolnirs.

Good hunting out there, pilots."

We at last come to your second journey to Cagliari station. The whole reason you are still here and that I am still talking to you.

Tell us, what happened at Cagliari station?"

5412, "What a preposterous story. You were quicker than that, weren't you? Weren't you TAGing those Shivan ships as soon as they jumped in? No, you're just going to have to start over."

5526, "The $h Vassago and its fleet may be dead, but its legacy remains with $v Cagliari station. The Shivans are building new ships and installations there. They're using the station itself as a raw material for their constructions.

The Shivans are using an agent called $h Black $h Ash. Black Ash consists of billions of nanomachines that eat away at everything, leaving behind a dark black compound the Shivans use to create just about anything. The countermeasure is quite simple- an intense enough alternating current is enough to repel it. However, due to the station being inactive, the Black Ash has quickly spread throughout the structure."

5527, "The higher ups would love to throw in a Meson bomb or two to vaporize everything in the area, but there's still something of value there. $y GTVA $y Command wants to get their mitts on Rachmann's transceiver. The Black Ash won't infest areas of the station with power, so we believe the transceiver and the surrounding area to be intact.

Any frontal assault risks harming the station and damaging the equipment. So, we're going to do this the hard way.

A while back we captured an Azrael transport, the $h ST $h Focalor. Our boys ripped out the insides and made it more... Terran comfortable.

The Focalor is going to carry a team to the station and extract what they can of the transceiver. Meanwhile you four get the mission of a life time. What I'm about to play is background for your mission."

5528, "$W EXCERPT BEGINS
$W 3:48:33

$g Agent: Just what was your end plan?

$E Rachmann: We needed to destroy the transceiver on Cagliari station. But we basically missed that chance after the Shivans took hold of it. I had another idea. Shivans... they don't quite see things like we do. They are much more sensitive to subspace activity than EM activity. My idea was to take a Shivan subspace drive and rig it so we would... feel Shivan from a distance.

With that we could get close enough to the station, and send a crew... an escape pod or something. It couldn't have a subspace drive on it or give off too much energy. They would go to the station and sabotage the reactor, destroying the transceiver and hopefully everything around it too.

$W EXCERPT ENDS"

5529, "I hope you've all read between the lines on that one. $f Alpha team will be outfitted in specially made $y Extra $y Vehicular $y Strike $y Platforms, yes, space suits, and proceed to sabotage various objectives around the station. The suits will have waypoint paths programmed into them so you won't get lost. The $f Focalor has had airlocks installed so you will launch and be retrieved by her."

Alpha 1 will proceed to an exposed $y reactor $y access $y panel and upload a virus cooked up by our electronic warfare guys. The virus will shut down every safeguard and drive the reactor into overload. At that point, everyone should be on their way out. With extreme haste, hopefully."

5537, "I can't say how the Shivans will react to your sneaking around. They might ignore you or decide to have you for lunch. We're arming you with the $y 33mm $y Bolt, a high explosive kinetic weapon, and the $y Subach $y HL-M, a smaller version of everyone's favorite sidearm. The suit also has room for 10 $y Tempest missiles on outer mountings. Keep in mind these weapons are for self defense only. The energy these things will put out will alert the Shivans and send them right to your position. Lock your master arms so you don't accidentally fire."

5539, "If you are discovered, get the hell back to the Focalor. There will be a small fleet of ships standing by to create the diversion you'll need to get out. If the rest of Alpha team has planted their charges, we'll blow them to try to distract or divide Shivan attention."

5540, "I guess that's about it. Good luck guys, I know if anyone can pull this suicide mission off, its you four. If you weren't, you wouldn't be here.

Now get out there and kick some Shivan ass."

If what killed the Psamtik was just the first of a whole new armada, this would be cause for concern.

Compared to Capella going nova, I think that's just a bit mild.

I wouldn't go calling this gospel just yet. What our friend saw is what they wanted him to see. I'll inform Command to proceed with Operation Lion's Den. Perhaps they can confirm any Shivan fleet movements.

And just what are we supposed to do about it?

I'll inform Command to proceed with Operation Lion's Den. Perhaps they can confirm any Shivan fleet movements. If they confirm the Sathanas armada, we're going to have to evacuate the whole system.
