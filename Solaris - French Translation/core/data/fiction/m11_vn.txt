MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Stuart lad. I swear if you're still at Akrotiri drinkin yourself to an early grave I'm gonna personally come over there an drive a boot up yer arse." 6881 "11a-01"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Where the hell have you been? I've heard nothing from you." 6882 "11a-02"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "First you leave Erskine to hang out with the Feds, and when you return you hole up in a border system and refuse to answer my questions." 6883 "11a-03"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Look, all I know about Morik is from CBN. That's enough for me to know that something big went down there and that you got caught up in it. You got to be off your trolley right now." 6884 "11a-04"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "If you're not gonna tell me what happened, at least take this chance to get your head sorted. I'm cashing out my terminal leave and answering a listing from someone looking for two contract pilots." 6885 "11a-05"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "It's out in Sulsia. I know it's a shithole in the middle of nowhere but it's a fresh start." 6886 "11a-06"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "If the Navy's really put you on half-pay it means you haven't got any Fleet commitments, so you've got no excuses." 6887 "11a-26"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Get yer arse out of Akrotiri and come take this job with me. You've got the skills for it and a could use someone familiar to watch ma back. It'll also give you a chance to make a difference again." 6888 "11a-07"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Besides, a know you can't look after yourself without someone to wipe your arse for you. What are friends for, am I right?" 6889 "11a-08"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Hi Stuart. Welcome to Sulsia. Thanks for applying for my job listing. I hear you've come all the way from the Alban Commonwealth." 6891 "11a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I'm Katherine Lau, captain of the corvette Hoshikuzu. I'm putting together a crew for some contract work. I could use a good pilot." 6892 "11a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Sulsia will be our area of operations. It's out in the fringes of colonised space but it's still a major trade hub. The Sulsian Hegemony exports a large number of mineral resources for manufacturing." 6893 "11a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "It's a huge frontier and the Sulsian navy's spread thin. Alban Commonwealth cruiser patrols used to keep order out here but with the war and all, they've all been pulled back home." 6894 "11a-12"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Now the trade corporations are having to fill the gaps left behind by hiring independents for security. This is a good opportunity to make some coin." 6895 "11a-13"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "As far as I can tell your certifications look good enough, but I want to see your skills for myself. The Hoshikuzu's still undergoing upgrade work so I'm taking the opportunity to run a performance assessment." 6896 "11a-14"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I've accepted a contract on your behalf from Lupe Ferris, the Overton station master. A single pilot like yourself should be able to pull this off." 6897 "11a-15"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "As you've probably seen on your way in, Overton Orbital is a graveyard for decommissioned ships. Station salvage drones comb the field for useful scrap which gets processed here and then sold on the market." 6898 "11a-16"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Ferris says several drones have been lost while on salvage missions - as in, more and more aren't returning to the station." 6899 "11a-17"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "These drones work autonomously, they aren't tracked or kept in sensor contact. A lot of this is unavoidable, the debris creates a lot of signal noise." 6900 "11a-18"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The station sensors have also detected low-energy signals out in the field. The debris chunks are all inert, so there shouldn't be anything out there." 6901 "11a-19"
SHOWICON player file="icon_herofighter" text="Bravo 1" color="none" x=40 y=35 xstrid=3604
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Ferris wants someone to go out and see what's generating those signals. If you can find out what's happening with the drones, that'll be a bonus too." 6902 "11a-20"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Your gunship is berthed in the station hangar. She's one of two custom-built craft." 6903 "11a-21"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "They were both in pretty good condition when I found them in the Overton field, and with modifications they're tough little birds." 6904 "11a-22"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "We might as well use the opportunity to see how well they fly with a pro at the stick." 6905 "11a-23"
