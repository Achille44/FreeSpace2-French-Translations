Vous vous êtes porté volontaire pour une assignation sous couverture avec le Commandement des Opérations Spéciales (SOC), en coordination avec l'Intelligence Vasudo-Terrienne Galactique (GTVI).

Notre objectif principal est de fournir à l'Alliance des informations précises et complètes sur les tactiques, technologies, activités, et objectifs stratégiques des forces hostiles à la GTVA."

47, "Votre assignation

Les missions avec le Commandement des Opérations Spéciales sont effectuées en plein territoire ennemi, avec un soutien logistique minimal. Nos activités derrière les lignes comprennent l'infiltration, le sabotage, les frappes chirurgicales, et la collecte d'informations.

Vous travaillerez sous couverture au sein du Front Néo-Terrien, à la tête de l'escadrille Alpha du 185ème escadron de chasse."

48, "Lt. Commandant Snipes

Votre contact dans cette mission est le Lieutenant-commandant Christopher Snipes, un officier allié qui a mis en scène sa défection au NTF il y a six mois. En tant que chef d'escadron du 185ème, Snipes vous informera de vos objectifs de mission à la fois en tant que pilote du NTF et comme agent allié.

Vous serez équipé avec un appareil qui vous permettra à vous et Snipes de communiquer sur une fréquence sécurisée sur le champ de bataille. Les vaisseaux du NTF interpréteront vos transmissions comme de simples données de ciblage."

49, "Le Projet ETAK

Le centre d'intérêt de cette opération secrète est le projet ETAK du NTF. L'accès aux informations étant restreint au plus haut niveau, nos connaissances sont limitées. ETAK implique le développement d'une nouvelle technologie de pointe, probablement une arme de destruction massive.

L'Amiral Bosch supervise le projet directement le projet, et les rebelles sont en train de construire un prototype sur le vaisseau amiral Iceni. Nous devons regarder ça de plus près. Même un simple scan de l'Iceni pourrait s'avérer utile."

50, "Un dernier avertissement

Nous travaillons en totale coopération avec le Commandement Tactique Vasudien et la 6ème Flotte Terrienne. Le probabilité d'engager des chasseurs alliés est minimale. Cependant, si vous deviez subir une attaque alliée, vous n'êtes autorisé à répliquer qu'en cas de légitime défense, ou bien en suivant les objectifs de mission définies par le Lieutenant-commandant Snipes.

Faites preuve de retenue et de jugement."

51, "Ici le Lieutenant-commandant Snipes. A tous nos pilotes de remplacement, bienvenue au 185ème. Comme vous le savez, la défaite de l'Amiral Koth dans le système Epsilon Pegasi a ouvert la voie à une attaque alliée dans le système Polaris. A 1425 heures, des forces expéditionnaires de la GTVA ont brisé notre blocus du nœud subpsatial. Le Colossus ne sera pas loin derrière."

52, "Bosch de prend pas de risques. Nous déplaçons le vaisseau amiral Iceni vers le système $b Regulus, où Bosch installera son gouvernement provisoire. Nous avons déjà pratiqué cet exercice, pilotes. Les escadrilles Alpha et Beta escorteront l'Iceni jusqu'au nœud subspatial. Delta, vous êtes en réserve."

53, "Le nœud subspatial de Regulus est localisé dans un petit champ d'astéroïdes. Notre travail est de dégager un passage. Les astéroïdes sur une trajectoire de collision avec l'Iceni seront indiqués par des crochets blancs sur votre HUD. Ainsi vous savez sur quels astéroïdes tirer. Les cannoniers de l'Iceni nous aideront, donc on ne devrait pas avoir top de problèmes."

54, "Très bien, pilote. J'ai une bonne et une mauvaise nouvelle. La bonne nouvelle est qu'on a amené l'Iceni et le Hinton vers Regulus. Les données de votre scan ont été transmises à la GTVI, et notre opération pour découvrir les secrets d'ETAK continue comme prévu.

La mauvaise nouvelle est que nous sommes bien plus en danger que vous semblez le penser. Les vaisseaux de guerre vasudiens étaient sous le commandement de l'Amiral Ahmose, qui avait entière connaissance de nos activités. Le fait que les Vasudiens connaissaient la position et l'horaire exacts du départ de l'Iceni a rendu les rebelles encore plus suspicieux.

Comme d'habitude, la GTVA a voulu placer la barre trop haut. Ahmose et ses subordonnés font maintenant face à une court martiale pour insubordination. Non seulement l'Amiral connaissait la position de l'Iceni, mais il n'était pas autorisé à agir avec ces informations. Notre escadron sera en tête de liste des suspects du NTF.

Une dernière chose. Les pilotes sous le commandement d'Ahmose ont été informés de son statut de renégat avant qu'ils ne lancent leur attaque. Sous ces circonstances, nous n'avions d'autre choix que de répliquer ou de foutre en l'air toute l'opération.

Surveillez vos arrières, pilote. Les choses ne vont pas aller en s'arrangeant."

Etant votre officier supérieur, il est de mon devoir de vous informer que vous serez exécuté à 2100 heures pour espionnage et haute trahison. Navré que cela doive se terminer ainsi, pilote."

56, "Nous n'aviez pas l'autorisation de retourner à la base. Vos actions ont mis en péril les vies de ceux impliqués dans cette mission ainsi que les objectifs du NTF dans ce théâtre.

91, "(fr)We arrive in Sirius in six hours. The 185th will be deployed immediately to rendezvous with the NTT Sunder. Our mission will be to escort the transport back to the Regulus jump node. The cargo on board the Sunder has been classified well beyond my level of clearance. Let's just say if the Sunder goes down, so do we."

92, "(fr)The Alliance is fighting to secure the Alpha Centauri and Deneb jump nodes, so intelligence believes the risk of engagement will be low. Of course, that's what they told us in Polaris, where we got jumped by half the Vasudan armada. Expect the unexpected, kids, and report to the flight deck at 1310 sharp. Dismissed."

93, "(fr)Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The C.O. of the Sevrin has taken the brunt of Bosch's wrath for the Sunder's alleged destruction. The captain and his lieutenants have faced a summary court martial and will be executed at 0700. When you sign up for the wrong outfit, you get what you deserve.

This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. The rebs are nuts, but they're not slow. It won't take them long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence. If it looks like they're on to you, your duty as an operative of the GTVI is to escape and report everything you know to allied forces. Understood?"

94, "(fr)Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The destruction of the Hamaka forced our hand. The rebs are now fully aware that we're card-carrying members of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, we achieved the objectives of this covert operation. It wouldn't have taken the rebs long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence.

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. It's been an honor working with you, pilot. Good luck!"

95, "(fr)You may proceed to the next GTVI mission only if the Hamako and Sunder survive."

96, "(fr)With the destruction of the Sunder, our heist failed. With only our scan of the Iceni to go on, unraveling the secret of Bosch's ETAK project will be nearly impossible. We invested six months into this operation and came away empty-handed. 

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. Sorry your tour with the GTVI wasn't more successful, pilot. You had potential."

119, "(fr)Our mission, Alpha 1, is to highjack the NTT Sunder. The transport pilot is one of us, so he'll follow course. We need to make the rebels think the Sunder has been destroyed. A decoy transport will arrive in a few minutes."

124, "(fr)Of course, that's if they don't hang us for failing the mission. We might be pushing our luck here, but what the hell."

125, "(fr)This is the NTCv Sevrin, 2nd Battle Group, Regulus. What is your status, pilots? We were instructed to rendezvous with a transport."

126, "(fr)Sevrin, you're late! Vasudans blasted my entire squad and two cruisers out here! You want a rendezvous? Scan that debris field! That's the Sunder right there! You're a disgrace to the NTF, Sevrin! I'm filing a report!"

127, "(fr)Stand down, Beta 1. We followed our orders to the letter. Now get back to base before the Vasudans return. There's nothing more we can do out here."

128, "(fr)You see the Hamako? That's the new AWACS ship. We're using it to block all enemy transmissions. As long as that ship remains operational, no one on the outside will know what we're up to. As far as the NTF is concerned, we're still loyal and devoted rebel pilots."

129, "(fr)So watch the Hamako, all right? If we lose the AWACS, our cover's blown for good."

130, "(fr)Keep your eye on the ball, kids. We're almost there. But if that decoy doesn't get here real soon, we'll have to bail."

131, "(fr)The Sunder is going down! All units, return to base. We blew this one big time."

132, "(fr)The NTC Mylae has jumped in. Watch the flak!"

133, "(fr)Nice shooting. The Mylae has been neutralized."

134, "(fr)Here comes the Hellespont, Aeolus-class."

135, "(fr)We've taken out the Hellespont. Well done, people."

136, "(fr)Okay, we've got the Naxos jumping in with the decoy! About time you guys made it.  Let's secure the area, and bring it on home."

137, "(fr)All right, Alpha 1. All we need to do is wait for the NTF. Hold your position."

138, "(fr)...But Hate the Traitor"

139, "(fr)Alpha 1 and the 185th attack a GTVA cargo depot.
"

140, "(fr)I'm Lieutenant Commander Jack Niven, your new squadron leader. Commander Snipes has been reassigned, so until further notice, you'll get your orders from me. With the 13th and 11th Vasudan battle groups advancing, we have a hard fight ahead of us. If we lose Sirius, our backs will be against the wall. The NTF has fought too hard to surrender now."

141, "(fr)The 4th Fleet, based in Vega, is providing the Vasudans with logistical support. They've established a cargo depot near the Alpha Centauri jump node. Recon reports a perimeter defense of 16 sentry guns, and fighter patrols inspect the depot at regular intervals. The 185th has been called in to sever that supply line. All targets are of Terran construction."

142, "(fr)Our attack will be timed between fighter patrols. Our objective is to destroy all cargo and sentry guns. Once we secure the area, we'll be in a position to ambush allied targets. The attack should lure the enemy to the depot and improve our odds in more critical engagements deeper in the system."

143, "(fr)We are lucky to get you back alive, pilot. Our deep-cover operatives stashed vital schematic data in your fighter's on board computer. With this information, GTVI analysts will be able to unravel the enigma of Bosch's ETAK project. 

These operatives also advised us of your impending execution. Unfortunately, we have no information concerning the whereabouts or status of Lieutenant Commander Snipes. We fear the odds of his survival are not favorable.

In recognition of your outstanding service to the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence and Special Operations Command, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross. With this honor, you are now one of an elite few. 

We will bring you as far as Vega, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine and continue with your next squadron assignment. Congratulations on a successful tour with the GTVI."

144, "(fr)You willfully fired upon and destroyed a civilian transport. Allied Command has expressed its shock and dismay that an allied officer would indulge in the slaughter of innocent people. 

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. "

171, "(fr)Lieutenant Commander Snipes

At 0437 reconnaissance units received a coded transmission from Lieutenant Commander Snipes. The Commander's vessel, the NTT Grall, is now adrift in a Shivan-infested region of the nebula and will not survive much longer. The Grall was docked to the NTC Alexandria when the cruiser ran our blockade of the Knossos portal in Gamma Draconis."

172, "(fr)S.O.S.

Here is part of the actual transmission.  We processed the message to enable better comprehension:

Granite Mountain, this is Black Dove requesting immediate extraction.  Engines and jump drives are inoperative.  Location, Delta 429 by 372.  Deployed Pharos beacons to assist search.  Heavy Shivan presence. Severe nebula storms.  Probability of survival not good."

173, "(fr)Allied Retreat

As you know, Allied forces are in full retreat to Gamma Draconis, so logistical support will be virtually non-existent. We have no available reinforcements and only one recovery ship. We're operating in a Shivan-infested area, so expect a fierce enemy offensive. The odds are against you on this one, pilot."

174, "(fr)You know why you're here, pilot, so let's get down to work. Recon located a Pharos navigation buoy not far from where Snipes's transmission was received. Your wing will be inserted at that position to find the Grall and make contact with Snipes. His transport has been incapacitated, and there's a high probability he's already a goner."

175, "(fr)This sector of the nebula is extremely volatile. Recon reports heavy EM interference, scrambling sensors and communications. These buoys are the only chance we have of finding Snipes and the Grall. The EM storm will make aspect lock difficult to acquire and maintain, so we recommend you loadout with Tempests and Rockeyes."

176, "(fr)Once you locate Snipes, call in Lambda 1. This is critical. Do not deploy the recovery craft until you are ready. Our transport will dock with the Grall and extract the survivors. You'll need to buy them some time as they complete this procedure. Good hunting. "

177, "(fr)Congratulations, pilot. You saved my life, and I owe you big. If I had more clout with the brass, I'd have them give you a Service Medallion, but they don't just hand those out. You didn't have to volunteer for this assignment, but I'm damn glad you did.

Now here's an important lesson. SOC didn't mount a rescue op because they liked me. They did it because I had information they needed, and information is what keeps you alive out here. Now I'm heading up the 99th for another mission, and I think we're going need you on this one. I already cleared it with Command, so it's your call, pilot. Hope you do the right thing."

178, "(fr)Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes distinguished himself as one of the best operatives ever to serve in the SOC. His courage, resourcefulness, and determination helped us defeat Admiral Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front. Snipes worked deep-cover for over six months, advising the GTVI of the enemy's movements, strategies, and capabilities. His career will stand as a shining example of service and sacrifice to the GTVA and the ideals for which the Alliance stands.

Lieutenant Commander Snipes is hereby posthumously awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the GTVA Special Operations Command. I know of no officer more worthy of such recognition."

179, "(fr)Protect the Grall as its passengers are being transferred to the recovery craft."

180, "Vous n'avez pas reçu l'autorisation de retourner à la base, pilote. Vos actions ont mis en péril la vie de ceux impliqués dans cette mission ainsi que les objectifs de la GTVA dans ce théâtre d'opérations. La désertion est passible de court martiale, et vous êtes confinés à vos quartiers en attendant votre audience préliminaire. Jusqu'à ce qu'une court martiale décide du contraire, vous êtes à présent privés de vos ailes et de tous les privilèges dûs à un officier de l'Alliance Galactique Vasudo-Terrienne."

194, "(fr)Maybe you didn't copy the first time, sir. I recommend we follow the nav buoys."

195, "(fr)Let's follow these nav buoys. If the Grall is still alive, these beacons will lead us straight to them."

196, "(fr)Roger that, SOC. Snipes here. Much obliged. Hope you brought a transport."

204, "(fr)The Shivans swarmed us near Gamma Drac, so we made an emergency jump. The rest is history."

205, "(fr)How many survivors?"

206, "(fr)17 of us made it to the transport. The shockwave banged us up pretty bad. Comm and life support were all we had to work with out here."

207, "(fr)What about the nav buoys?"

208, "(fr)The Alexandria deployed them. We couldn't rely on navigation or sensors, so that was our best option."

209, "(fr)You have any information for us?"

212, "(fr)Snipes leads Alpha wing of the 99th Skulls on a mission through the second Knossos portal.
"

213, "(fr)Here's the situation. Allied Command has ordered the full retreat of all GTVA forces. They've written off Gamma Draconis, so they're moving the armada into Capella to hold down the system. Meanwhile, SOC needs a unit to fly suicide to check out a second Knossos device the Vasudans found deep in the nebula."

214, "(fr)To give us a fighting chance, our unit will fly a wing of Shivan fighters SOC forces captured early in the nebula campaign. Our engineers have modified and optimized these craft. They'll handle even better than the Shivan original, and if you play it right, you might even avoid enemy detection. "

215, "(fr)We're going in with a handpicked squad. You'll fly Alpha 1. I've got Alpha 2. Two of our top pilots, Xinny and Zero, will cover Alphas 3 and 4, respectively. Our Maras will be equipped with intersystem jump drives so we can use the node."

216, "(fr)The timetable for this mission is 15 minutes. We'll jump in, gather data, hold down the fort, then jump out. Your drives will be inoperative inside a window of exactly 15 seconds. If we miss our jump, the recovery ship will leave us behind. There's no room for error."

217, "(fr)Here's something else to think about. By the time we launch, we'll be the only allied operatives left in the nebula. There'll be no reinforcement, no support, and no base to run to. That's why this mission has to be carried out by the numbers. We have fifteen minutes. No more. No less."

218, "(fr)Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. GTVA analysts are now reviewing our flight data.

Unfortunately, we failed to destroy a single one of those Shivan devices. The Alliance demands top-notch flying from its elite squads, and our performance out there was a little disappointing. At least we were able to warn the Alliance.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

219, "(fr)It is possible to destroy the Shivan device that you discovered."

220, "(fr)Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. I've advised the GTVI that multiple Juggernaut-class warships are now en route to the Capella system. We'll have our hands full getting everyone out of there alive.

By the way, nice work destroying that Shivan technology. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

For helping to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA, you are hereby awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by Special Operations Command. Congratulations.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

Great work neutralizing those Shivan devices. You delivered a top-notch performance. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

235, "(fr)Outstanding, Alpha 1. Whatever that thing was, the Shivans got less of them now. Let's take out what we can before we get back to the node."

236, "(fr)Okay, that makes two. Good teamwork, squad. Let's go for the triple play. Seek and destroy."

237, "(fr)And that's clean sweep. Nice work, Alpha wing. Makes me proud to be SOC. Now let's get back to the node. Binary systems give me the creeps."

253, "(fr)Reconnaissance has located a Moloch-class Shivan corvette, designation $h Nosferatu, in the Gamma Draconis system. Allied forces have tangled with the $h Nosferatu before in this theater of operations, and we've lost many good pilots in the struggle."

254, "(fr)Intelligence believes the corvette was en route to reinforce the Shivan fleet near the Capella jump node. However, the vessel aborted its subspace jump before it could reach its destination, perhaps because of an engine or navigation subsystem failure."

255, "(fr)With the corvette isolated from the main Shivan force, we now have an opportunity to take it out of circulation. Your mission is to destroy the $h Nosferatu and its fighter complement. Command will commit no more than one wing for this sortie, and we have just one chance. Given your exemplary combat record, we are confident you are up to the challenge."

256, "(fr)Well done, Alpha wing. Outnumbered and outgunned, you destroyed the Nosferatu and its fighters before they could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Command will be very pleased with this outcome."

257, "(fr)Good work, Alpha. You destroyed the Nosferatu before it could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Regrettably, some of the Dragon fighters survived the assault. As you know, Dragons are among the most formidable fighters in the Shivan arsenal, and reducing their numbers is always a high priority. Nevertheless, you achieved your primary objective."

258, "(fr)Although you neutralized the Nosferatu's fighter complement, you failed to achieve your primary objective. Consequently, the Nosferatu remains a formidable threat to our forces in the Gamma Draconis system. Needless to say, Command will be disappointed with this outcome."

259, "(fr)Be sure to take along at least two bombers to destroy the Nosferatu."

260, "(fr)Command will not be pleased with your failure to destroy the Nosferatu or its fighters. You were selected for this mission because the Allied leadership had faith in your ability to perform under pressure. Unfortunately, our assessment of your skills is significantly off the mark. The Nosferatu remains a formidable threat to our forces in the Gamma Draconis system."

Shivan battle groups continually try to gain control of this node and enter the system beyond. We cannot let them. The $f 32nd $f Battle $f Group is engaged with the Shivans on the other side of the node. Our patrol begins in 15 minutes. That is all, pilots."

273, "(fr)You succeeded in stopping the Shivans. The 32nd will have you to thank for making their lives much easier. Well done.

"

274, "(fr)The Shivans have broken through to the Epsilon Pegasi system. You could have prevented this, if you had performed better. The 32nd has failed to report in.

282, "(fr)We have just received a communication from Admiral Bosch. His orders
are for every $f NTF battle group to send half its strength to the Deneb system immediately. There's an offensive planned and Bosch wants to gather forces before striking. Our group will send the three warships you helped us capture in your previous mission."

283, "(fr)The ships have been repaired and re-commissioned as the $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and the $f Vindication. I've called you here today because there's a problem. The $h GTVA has apparently gotten wind of Bosch's plans and has moved to prevent him from gathering more force."

284, "(fr)A $h GTVA battle group is now blocking our path to the Deneb jump node. Our scouts confirmed the presence of a strong force, but could not penetrate the screening cover of fighters to get an accurate ship count. "

285, "(fr)We have to go in to clear the way for our warships to reach the jump node. Since we're not sure what we'll encounter, individual assignments will be made by me once we arrive. We need to do our job no matter what's out there. The $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and $f Vindication must make it through the blockade.  Everything else is secondary."

286, "(fr)The cargo we acquired from the $h GTVA held the parts we needed to repair a few Erinyes-class fighters. You'll find them on the flight deck
when you're selecting your ships. Be ready to fly in 15 minutes."

287, "(fr)That was excellent flying, pilots! It was a tough assignment, but you came through with a great performance. Getting our warships past the GTVA blockade is a tremendous boost to NTF morale and can't help but further your career. Stand down, pilots. You've earned a good rest."

288, "(fr)No recommendation available."

289, "(fr)This mission was a complete disaster. Though it was a tough assignment, you should have done much better. Thousands of lives were lost today, and you're at least partly to blame. I'll decide later whether you'll ever fly for us again. Dismissed."

290, "(fr)Try the mission again. If you can't complete it, perhaps the difficulty setting is too high."

291, "(fr)This mission was a partial success, but we should have done much better. We should eradicate every Vasudan target that presents itself. By letting the Murakami escape, we ensured that it'll make our lives miserable another day. Next time, let's have a clean mission with no loose ends. Dismissed."

324, "(fr)Your mission is to destroy the rebel fighter wing and patrol the Regulus jump node. Intercept any incoming hostiles and destroy as many as possible before they can jump to Sirius III. Unfortunately, we can spare no reinforcements for this mission. Good luck, Alpha."

325, "(fr)Outstanding work, pilot. Because you held off rebel reinforcements at the Regulus jump node, our forces achieved a decisive victory on Sirius III.  The NTF has been pushed entirely off the planet."

326, "(fr)Good work, Alpha. You prevented all but a handful of rebel ships from reinforcing NTF troops on Sirius III. The GTVA won a major victory with only minor casualties. Small pockets of NTF resistance are being cleared out as we speak."

327, "(fr)Command regrets that you failed to destroy more hostiles at the Regulus jump node. Allied forces suffered heavy casualties on Sirius III and achieved only a minor victory. NTF strongholds on Sirius III will remain a danger until another offensive can be mounted."

328, "(fr)The NTF remains firmly entrenched on Sirius III. Allied forces suffered major casualties during our retreat. Perhaps if you had intercepted those rebel warships at the Regulus node, the outcome of this battle would have been very different."

329, "(fr)You did not have authorization to leave the Regulus jump node. As a result, the rebels were able to reinforce their troops on Sirius III and decimate our ground forces. Your act of insubordination may have cost us hundreds of casualties."

507, "Bienvenue sur l'Aquitaine

Ici l'Amiral Petrarch, officier commandant du GTD Aquitaine. A tous les escadrons nous ayant rejoint à Vega, bienvenue a bord.

Avec un total de 150 chasseurs, l'Aquitaine sert comme vaisseau amiral de la 3ème flotte de la GTVA, basée dans le système Capella. Vous rejoignez un équipage d'élite de 10 000 hommes, les meilleurs officiers et personnels servant dans l'Alliance à ce jour."

508, "Le Front Néo-Terrien (NTF)

Après 18 mois d'affrontements, le Front Néo-Terrien de l'Amiral Bosch est devenu la menace la plus importante depuis la fin de la Grande Guerre, il y a 32 ans.

Le NTF exige l'indépendance de ses systèmes et la révocation de la Convention de Beta Aquilae, ou BETAC. Le traité de BETAC a décrété la GTVA comme autorité suprême dans l'espace vasudo-terrien."

509, "L'idéologie Néo-Terrienne

L'idéologie du NTF est d'après la vision de Bosch, une société utopique où la splendeur perdue de la Terre sera reconstituée. Bosch et ses disciples s'opposent à toute alliance avec les Vasudiens qu'ils voient comme une menace au futur de la race humaine.

Les rebelles se sont retranchés dans les systèmes Polaris, Regulus et Sirius. Mais avant de frapper ces bastions, nous devons sécuriser Epsilon Pegasi, Alpha Centauri et Deneb. Ces systèmes contestés sont à présent les centres d'attention des opérations alliées."

510, "La bataille de Deneb

Le commandement allié a ordonné à l'Aquitaine de se rendre dans le système Deneb. Nous y renforcerons le 13ème groupement tactique vasudien, mené par le GVD Psamtik.

Le NTF et la GTVA ont subi de lourdes pertes dans la bataille pour Deneb. Durant les dernières 72 hours, nous avons perdu le GVC Andromeda, le GTC Trafalgar, et plus de 15 escadrilles de chasseurs. Le commandement prévoit que l'arrivée de l'Aquitaine et du Psamtik fera basculer la bataille pour Deneb en notre faveur et forcera le NTF à se replier vers Sirius."

511, "Ici le capitaine Loukakis, chef d'escadron du 53ème Hammerheads. A 0320 heures, l'$f Aquitaine est arrivé dans le système Deneb. L'Amiral Petrarch a déployé des escadrilles de chasseurs et de bombardiers en vue d'une attaque générale contre les positions du $h NTF à travers le système. Il a gardé les Hammerheads en réserve, jusqu'à maintenant."

512, "Une situation se développe près de la planète habitée de Cygnus Prime. Plus de 100 000 réfugiés vasudiens fuient leurs colonies en transports. Les vaisseaux alliés viennent en aide aux Vasudiens aussi vite que possible, bien que la logistique de cette opération laisse encore de nombreux réfugiés vulnérables aux attaques rebelles."

513, "A 0545, nous avons reçu un signal de détresse d'un convoi de réfugiés à 900 kilomètres de l'orbite de Cygnus Prime$|. Les Vasudiens ont répondu en envoyrant une escadrille de chasseurs Serapis, désignation Epsilon, qui viennent juste de demander des renforts. Escadrille Alpha, c'est là que vous intervenez."

514, "Puisque ces transports n'ont pas de système de saut, vous devrez protéger le convoi jusqu'à ce qu'un vaisseau de récupération arrive. Avec tous les vaisseaux de guerre engagés et d'autres convois ayant besoin de protection, nous ne savons pas quand une aide sera disponible. Le commandement vous tiendra informé et enverra des renforts si nécessaire."

515, "Bon travail, pilote. Vous avez repoussé l'attaque rebelle et avez sauvé les deux transports vasudiens de la destruction. Vos coéquipiers et moi-même sommes d'accord : vous serez un bon élément au sein du 53ème Hammerheads. Le commandement rapporte que 75% des réfugiés ont été récupérés avec peu de pertes. Les 25% restants sont sous protection alliée et seront récupérés sous peu. Nous avons aussi remporté d'importantes victoires face au NTF. le NTD Jacobus et le NTC Hengst ont été détruits, et nos blocus des nœeuds subspatiaux d'Alpha Centauri et Sirius ont isolé la flotte rebelle. De plus, 600 000 troupes débarqueront bientôt à la surface de Cygnus Prime dans notre effort pour reprendre la planète. Préparez-vous pour votre prochaine mission, pilote. La bataille pour Deneb n'est pas encore terminée."

516, "En tant qu'officiers de la GTVA, nous avons juré de protéger tous les citoyens de l'Alliance. La destruction des transports Iota est regrettable, pilote. Si ce n'étais pas votre première sortie, je recommanderais votre transfert immédiat hors du corps des chasseurs. Nous allons vous donner une autre chance.

Le commandement rapporte de lourdes pertes parmi les convois de réfugiés vasudiens. Seulement 50% ont été récupérés, et les survivants sont encore en danger.

Nos efforts pour repousser les rebelles de Deneb ont été vains. Bien que nous ayons détruit le NTC Hengst, nous avont perdu le GTC Coriolanus et le GVC Mirage. Des briseurs de blocus continuent de ravitailler la flotte rebelle, et l'opération pour libérer Cygnus Prime a été retardée.

L'Alliance reste engagée dans cet effort contre-insurrectionnel, bien que la bataille pour Deneb ne sera pas gagnée sans sacrifice."

517, "Engagez les chasseurs rebelles avant qu'ils n'atteignent les transports. Utilisez vos missiles pour les abattre rapidement, et restez près du convoi."

518, "En tant qu'officiers de la GTVA, nous avons juré de protéger tous les citoyens de l'Alliance. La destruction des deux transports Iota est une tragédie, pilote. Vous avez déshonnoré le 53ème Hammerheads, et je vais recommandé votre départ immédiat du corps des chasseurs.

L'offensive de l'Alliance est maintenant un désastre. Seulement 25% des réfugiés vasudiens ont été récupérés, alors que le NTF continue d'en massacrer des milliers sans merci.

Le commandement rapporte la perte du GTD Aeneas, du GTC Coriolanus, et du GVC Mirage. Nos efforts pour bloquer les nœuds subspatiaux d'Alpha Centauri et de Sirius ont échoué. Le Conceil de Sécurité va ordonner à la flotte de se retirer de Deneb et d'engager des négociations avec le NTF."

Six tourelles de défense sont positionnées autour du dépôt, et des cargos rebelles sont en train d'évacuer la cargaison de la zone. Le $h NTF a eu beaucoup de mal à cacher ces matériaux."

566, "Alpha 1, Votre mission est de rechercher et détruire toutes les cibles d'opportunité, incluant les cargos, cargaisons et tourelles de défense. L'escadrille $f Beta scannera les cargaisons. La reconnaissance a détecté une escadrille de $h Lokis gardant le dépôt, votre priorité est de les détruire."

567, "Ne sous-estimez pas l'importance de cette mission, pilote. Un raid sur un dépôt ne vous fera pas gagner de médaille, mais cela peut s'avérer aussi vital que de détruire un croiseur ou une corvette. Nous devons rompre les lignes de ravitaillement rebelles si nous voulons obtenir une victoire décisive."

568, "Le commandement n'a fourni aucune explication officielle concernant la présence de l'Amiral Bosch dans le système Deneb. La base cachée et les cargaisons protégées ne font que renforcer le mystère de l'agenda de l'Amiral. Sous ces circonstance, Il n'y avait rien que vous puissiez faire pour stopper la fuite de la frégate de commandement de Bosch, désignée NTF Iceni."

569, "Les renseignements ont aussi appris que le Front Néo-Terrien travaille sur un projet secret du nom d'ETAK, probablement une arme de destruction massive. En détruisant toutes les cargaisons du dépôt, nous avons perturbé les recherches de Bosch."

Bon boulot pour la neutralisation de ces chasseurs et cargos. Vous avez bien servi le 53ème Hammerheads. Votre performance lors de cette dernière mission prouve que vous avez ce qu'il faut pour devenir un As. J'ai recommandé votre transfert au 107ème Ravens. Ils ont perdu beaucoup de bons officiers sur Deneb, et il pourraient bien avoir besoin de vos talents. C'est une unité de premier ordre. Je sais que vous nous rendrez fier.

Bien que vous vous en êtes sortis dans ces circonstance difficiles, nous aurions dû détruire ce cargo rebelle avant qu'il ne quitte le système.

Vous ne volerez plus au sein du 53ème Hammerheads. J'ai recommandé votre transfert au 107ème Ravens. 80 % de leur unité a été décimée sur Deneb, ils recherchent donc désespéremment de nouveaux pilotes.

667, "Attaque shivienne

Aux officiers et à l'équipage du GTD Aquitaine, ici l'Amiral Petrarch. A 0115 heures, nous avons reçu une transmission du Quartier Général de la 3ème Flotte. Un croiseur shivien et trois escadrilles de chasseurs ont pris en embuscade et détruit le GTC Vigilant alors qu'il patrouillait près du nœud subspatial de Gamma Draconis dans le système Capella.

Le commandement a déployé le GTD Carthage et le GVCv Dahshor. Bien que ces vaisseaux aient neutralisé la menace immédiate, toutes les unités alliées sont à présent en vigilance élevée."

668, "Gamma Draconis

Le commandement a ordonné à l'Aquitaine de mener l'opération à Gamma Draconis pendant que nous enquêtons sur l'origine et l'étendue de cette incursion.

Gamma Draconis est un système distant et inhabité découvert peu avant le déclenchement de la Grande Guerre. Le système ne possède ni planète ni ressource viable. Le GTSC Erikson a exploré le système 15 ans auparavant sans rien rapporter d'anormal."

669, "Un Portail Subspatial ?

Les missions de reconnaissance dans le système Gamma Draconis ont détecté de l'activité près d'un nœud subspatial inexploré. Une observation de plus près a révélé que ce nœud n'est pas un phénomène naturel mais un gigantesque portail subspatial d'origine inconnue.

Nous ne savons pas pourquoi l'Erikson n'a pas pu détecter le portail lorsqu'il a exploré le système. Le portail devait alors être inactif et donc invisible aux scanner longue-portée, ou bien il s'agirait d'un construction récente."

670, "Les Shiviens

Les vaisseaux shiviens qui ont détruit le Vigilant ne sont pas du même type que ceux rencontrés lors de la Grande Guerre. Le croiseur léger, nom de code Rakshasa, et les chasseurs, nom de code Mara, ont été ajoutés à votre base de données embarquée.

Il s'agit de notre premier contact avec cette espèce depuis trois décennies. Nos objectifs sont clairs. Nous devons sécuriser Gamma Draconis ou faire face à notre annihilation une seconde fois."

671, "Ici le Lieutenant Samsa, commandant d'escadron du 107ème Ravens. Voici la situatiob. Le $f GTD $f Aquitaine est entré dans le système Gamma Draconis à 1640 heures. Le vaisseau Amiral défendra le nœud de Capella pendant que nous avancerons pour sécuriser le système. La reco a découvert un dépôt de ravitaillement shivien près du portail subspatial, et ce sera notre cible."

672, "Le commandement croit que les Shiviens se préparent pour attaque de grande envergure sur Capella. le $h SC $h Behemoth, un croiseur de classe Rakshasa, protège le dépôt avec une escadrille de chasseurs Mara. Ces cargos ennemis entrent dans le système, larguent leur cargaison, et repartent vers le portail. Votre mission, pilote, est d'effectuer un balayage complet de la zone."

673, "Vos principales cibles seront les chasseurs Mara. Une fois l'escorte éliminée, détruisez le $h Behemoth et tous les cargos aux alentours. Vous devrez tenir la zone jusqu'au déploiement du Carthage et du $f Dahshor$| . Une fois que vous aurez sécurisé la zone, nous déploieront les escadrilles Delta et Epsilon pour vous relever."

674, "Vous avez survécu à votre première sortie contre les Shiviens. Bien que nous n'ayons eu affaire qu'à une petite force d'opposition, la survie est la moitié de la bataille. Les officiers commandants du Carthage et du Dahshor ont fait l'éloge de notre escadron pour l'excellente couverture que nous avons fourni. Le croiseur shivien Cain et son escorte de chasseurs auraient pu détruire ces vaisseaux si nous n'étions pas intervenus. Beau travail, pilote.

Une force opérationnelle vasudo-terrienne, sous la direction du Dr. Mina Hargrove, étudie à présent le portail subspatial. Nous attendons un rapport préliminaire d'ici quelques heures."

675, "Vous avez survécu à votre première sortie contre les Shiviens. Bien que nous n'ayons eu affaire qu'à une petite force d'opposition, la survie est la moitié de la bataille. Malheureusement, les 10 000 hommes et femmes à bord du Carthage n'ont pas eu cette chance. En tant qu'unité, nous devons accepter la responsabilité de cette catastrophe. En combattant plus férocement, nous aurions pu sauver ce destroyer. Une cérémonie aux morts sera donnée à 0100 heures sur le Pont 36.

Le système de Gamma Draconis maintenant sécurisé, une force opérationnelle de scientifiques terriens et vasudiens examine à présent le portail subspatial. Les scientifiques ont d'ores et déjà exclu la possibilité que le dispositif est d'origine shivienne.

Dr. Mina Hargrove, chef de l'équipe de recherche, a publié un rapport de ses résultats préliminaires. Voici un extrait de son rapport."

723, "Dr. Hargrove, Découvertes de la Force Opérationnelle (Extrait)

Le portail subspatial est différent de toutes les constructions shiviennes rencontrées. Bien que les Shiviens font preuve de diversité en tant qu'espèce, toutes les technologies shiviennes possèdent certaines partagent certaines spécificités. Aucune d'elles n'est présente dans le dispositif subspatial, ce qui signifie que nous devons chercher l'origine du portail ailleurs. Nous savons que le dispositif est très, très ancien, de l'ordre de plusieurs milliers d'années."

724, "Vortex subspatiaux

Les mouvements opposés des composants du portail créent un vortex subspatial, connectant un point de l'univers vers un autre. Le Dr. Hargrove émet l'hypothèse que ceux qui ont construit ce dispositif l'ont utilisé pour stabiliser un nœud subspatial sur le point de s'effondrer. 

Si la théorie du Dr. Hargrove est correcte, cette technologie est une découverte colossale."

725, "Un chemin vers la Terre ?

En construisant notre propre portail, nous pourrions être capables de réouvrir le nœud subspatial vers le système solaire dans le système Delta Serpentis. Depuis la destruction du Lucifer causant l'effondrement du nœud il y a trente-deux ans, la Terre est restée isolée de la GTVA.

Nous pourrions également être en mesure de stabiliser des nœuds subspatiaux actuellement trop instables pour être utilisés, ce qui permettrait de créer des routes vers des systèmes encore inexplorés."

726, "Au-delà du Portail

Nos opérations militaires se concentreront sur ce qui se trouve de l'autre côté du portail subspatial. Nous devons déterminer où ce nœud mène et l'ampleur de la présence shivienne là-bas. Avant tout, nous devons empêcher les Shiviens de retourner dans le système Gamma Draconis.

Etant donné que le portail restera actif pendant que l'équipe de recherche étudie la technologie, nos sytèmes sont vulnérables à une attaque. Le commandement allié estime que c'est un risque acceptable au vu des bénéfices potentiels."

727, "A 1540 heures, le $f GTD $f Aquitaine est entré dans le portail subspatial de Gamma Draconis, le menant à notre position actuelle. Nous sommes entrés dans une nébuleuse, une vaste zone densément ionisée, et probablement les restes d'une supernova. Nous avons voyagé plus loin qu'aucun autre Terrien dans l'histoire du voyage subspatial."

728, "La nébuleuse a sévèrement limité les capteurs longue-portée de l'Aquitaine. Nous déployons nos escadrilles de chasseurs pour explorer les alentours immédiats et déterminer l'ampleur de la présence ennemie. Chaque escadron de chasseurs déploiera quatre escadrilles."

729, "Alpha, Zeta, Iota, et Kappa patrouilleront une série de quatre points de contrôle. L'escadrille Zeta mènera cette sortie, donc suivez Zeta 1 et ne vous éloignez pas. Sachez que la nébuleuse pourrait interférer avec vos systèmes de bord. Le champ ionisé compromettra vos capteurs, même à courte portée."

730, "Vous avez affronté une force shivienne écrasante dans un environnement hostile. Dans ces circonstances, il n'y a rien que vous ou qui que ce soit d'autre aurait pu faire pour sauver le Trinity et notre vaisseau de récupération. Vous êtes chanceux d'avoir survécu à cette sortie, pilote.

Nous n'avons reçu aucune nouvelle de l'escadrille Kappa après leur disparition des radars. Malheureusement, nous devons imaginer le pire. Ils seront listés Disparus Au Combat à moins que nous trouvions la preuve du contraire. Nos équipes de recherche n'ont trouvé aucune trace de ces chasseurs.

La présence du Trinity épaissit le mystère autour de l'agenda secret du NTF. Que faisait le Trinity par ici, et que sait Bosch à propos du portail subspatial ? 

Toutes les patrouilles ont découvert une importante force shivienne dans la nébuleuse. Le commandement déploiera plus de vaisseaux de guerre à travers le portail subspatial pour nous assister dans notre mission d'exploration et de confinement. Les escadrilles Iota et Epsilon ont rencontré deux croiseurs shiviens près de notre position actuelle. Quand les renforts arriveront, nous lancerons l'attaque."

777, "Plutôt combattre le NTF si vous voulez mon avis. Je n'ai jamais signé pour chasser des Shiviens."

778, "Ne vous faites pas d'illusions. Nous sommes ceux qui se font chasser, pilote."

779, "Le commandement devrait fermer ce portail et renvoyer l'Aquitaine dans le système Deneb. Nous n'avons rien à faire ici."

837, "(fr)The Shivans fought nothing but Great War relics. We'll show them what firepower is all about."

838, "(fr)I'm picking up something! A wing of enemy fighters closing in!"

839, "(fr)Alpha and Beta, intercept those bandits! Keep them off the Lysander and Actium!"

840, "(fr)A Cain-class cruiser now coming into view!"

841, "(fr)Confirmed. It's the Asuras! Firing all guns!"

842, "(fr)Damn it, Actium, watch that friendly fire!"

843, "(fr)Avoid the beam and you won't get hit, pilot!"

844, "(fr)All hostile fighters eliminated. Those Shivans put up a good fight!"

845, "(fr)Well done, pilots. Help the corvettes finish off the Asuras, but don't get too close!"

846, "(fr)Okay, let's find that Rakshasa. Continue on your current heading. If you need to rearm, pilots, now would be a good time."

847, "(fr)With the technology they had 30 years ago, it's a miracle we won the Great War."

848, "(fr)No shields. No flak guns. No beam cannons."

849, "(fr)Hey, Command. You gonna tell us what the rebels are doing out here?"

850, "(fr)You'll be informed on a need-to-know basis, pilot. Now kill the chatter and focus on your mission!"

851, "(fr)New readings coming up on sensors! Incoming fighters!"

852, "(fr)Iblis now within in range! All guns, fire for effect."

853, "(fr)Stay focused, pilots! We need more fighter cover! Do not let them lure you away!"

854, "(fr)A wing of Seraphim is approaching fast! Intercept those bombers!"

855, "(fr)The hull integrity of the Iblis has fallen below critical! We're almost there!"

856, "(fr)Command, something massive has jumped in! The database does not recognize the configuration!"

857, "(fr)Where? What is it? I can't get a visual!"

858, "(fr)Command, we have a situation here!"

859, "(fr)Can you get a closer look, Lysander?"

860, "(fr)We've lost the Actium!"

861, "(fr)All vessels return to base! We need to regroup! Get out of there, pilots!"

862, "(fr)The Seraphim are history! Well done, pilots!"

863, "(fr)You hear about Kappa wing? Vanished without a trace five clicks from the Aquitaine."

864, "(fr)Their patrol found the NTC Trinity, right? "

865, "(fr)Yeah, that was Arthur Roemig's ship. Hard to believe he turned traitor."

866, "(fr)Slaying Ravana"

867, "(fr)The 107th leads a bombing action against the Shivan destroyer Ravana.
"

868, "(fr)This is Lieutenant Samsa. The allied attack against the $h SD $h Ravana has deteriorated. We've lost the $f GTD $f Delacroix, and the surviving warships in the battle group are damaged. Petrarch is scrambling the 107th to assist. Command will also sortie the $f GVC $f Somtus and the $f GTC $f Yakiba. Once they cross the subspace portal, we will move them into position."

869, "(fr)For this mission, we'll fly the GTB Boanerges, the Alliance's new attack bomber. The Boanerges maximizes shielding and payload, while offering enough manueverability to make it a viable tactical unit. The bomber won't handle as well as the Herc II, so stay on the move. Bombers make easy targets."

870, "(fr)With our Cyclops torpedoes, we'll have the firepower to take out the $h Ravana. If you're too far from the target, the flak guns will neutralize your bomb, so get as close as possible. Once you fire your salvo, hit your burners to get clear of the blast. The Cyclops has an extensive lock time and countdown."

871, "(fr)If we succeed, we will have secured the jump node between the nebula and Gamma Draconis. If we fail, we pave the way for a Shivan invasion of our systems. Good luck, pilot. We know you can do it."

872, "(fr)The destruction of the Ravana is the most significant victory over the Shivans since the end of the Great War. We have secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis, and we have demonstrated our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. We have proven without a doubt that we have the firepower to neutralize any Shivan threat. 

A new class of intercept fighter will be stationed on board the Aquitaine. I have recommended that you be transferred to this unit. Interceptors are fast, high-performance fighters requiring pilots with good reflexes. You've got the talent for it, and you'll represent the Ravens well.  

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will brief the crew about our upcoming operation."

873, "(fr)In the aftermath of this debacle, we are faced with the prospect of fighting an all-out war on multiple fronts. Somebody will have to take the fall for this, and it's going to be the 107th. Command has disbanded our unit and will reassign its survivors to new posts in the allied fleet. Frankly, I think we'll be lucky if they let us fly support ships. Dismissed."

874, "(fr)Monitor the hull integrity of your allied ships. It helps to disarm the Ravana early in the mission."

875, "(fr)We destroyed the Ravana and secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis. However, with our losses, this victory is Pyrrhic at best. The Delacroix, the Champion, the Khenmu, the Heisenberg, the Yakiba, and the Somtus all perished in this engagement.  

With the heavy casualties we have suffered, Admiral Petrarch will reorganize the Aquitaine's fighter squadrons. As captain of the 107th Ravens, it is my sad duty to report that after forty years of service, our unit will be disbanded. 

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system, and there we will receive our new assignments."

876, "(fr)Destroy Ravana"

877, "(fr)All allied warships have been destroyed. Return to base."

878, "(fr)I've acquired sensor lock on the Ravana. The destroyer is currently out of range."

879, "(fr)No visual on allied ships, but we can see their cannon signature."

880, "(fr)Bombers, close in on the Ravana. We must end this now."

881, "(fr)Roger that, Command. Warheads are armed and ready."

882, "(fr)Watch the friendly fire! You get hit, and you won't make it to your own service!"

883, "(fr)Command, this is the GTC Yakiba. We are engaging the Ravana now."

884, "(fr)Command, this is the GVC Somtus. Bringing turrets to bear. Firing for effect."

885, "(fr)We need more firepower, Command!"

886, "(fr)No allied vessels are currently able to assist. We must accomplish our objectives with the resources we have committed to this mission."

887, "(fr)The Ravana's hull integrity has fallen below critical. Destruction of primary target is imminent."

888, "(fr)Ravana objective neutralized! All units, return to base!"

889, "(fr)We've lost the Heisenberg!"

890, "(fr)The Shivans destroyed the Yakiba!"

891, "(fr)The Khenmu has been lost!"

892, "(fr)The Somtus has gone down!"

893, "(fr)The Sixth Wonder"

894, "(fr)The 242nd Suicide Kings repel a rebel assault on Enif Station, the GTVA's base of operations in the Epsilon Pegasi system."

895, "(fr)Enif Massacre

36 hours ago, the NTF launched a full-scale offensive in Epsilon Pegasi, taking the GTVA 6th Fleet by surprise. Commanding his forces from the NTD Repulse, Rear Admiral Koth leads the rebel advance. With 75 percent of our forces in this system decimated, the regional death toll since the incursion now exceeds 80,000.
 
Unless we act quickly, a decisive rebel victory is imminent."

896, "(fr)Stalemate in Sirius

The GTD Aquitaine will lead the allied counterstrike against Koth and his warships. We will resupply in Capella before shipping out to the front. 

We have also learned our campaign in Sirius has failed. A two-pronged offensive launched from Alpha Centauri and Deneb encountered fierce resistance. Unless we can devise a military solution for dealing with the rebels, the GTVA will be forced to recognize the NTF's authority in Sirius, Regulus, and Polaris."

897, "(fr)On the Vanguard

Allied engineers in the meantime are developing and adapting technologies that will enable us to fight more effectively in the nebula. Dr. Hargrove and her research team continue to study the subspace portal. Their findings have been classified level Phi.

Until the situation in Epsilon Pegasi has been normalized, the GTVA will suspend its operations in the nebula."

898, "(fr)This is Lieutenant Commander Cordova, leader of the 242nd Suicide Kings. Welcome to Epsilon Pegasi, pilots. $f Enif $f Station, the Alliance's base of operations in this system, is now under attack. Though we have destroyed the $h NTC $h Outrage, the $h Cato continues to bombard the installation with heavy beam fire."

899, "(fr)Evacuation of civilian personnel on board $f Enif $f Station is now in progress. As you know, civilians are protected under the Beta Aquilae Convention, but the $h NTF has rejected that treaty and its provisions. Fortunately, most of the civilian convoy has jumped safely to the Capella jump node."

900, "(fr)Your mission is to defend $f Enif $f Station. As leader of Alpha wing, you will command your squadmates to destroy the fighters and warships besieging our installation. If the rebels sortie their Zeus bombers, intercept the warheads before they impact the base. "

901, "(fr)Allied forces are engaging the rebels throughout the system. As resources become available, they will be deployed to assist you. Until we get these reinforcements, however, holding down the fort is all up to you. This sortie will be the first combat field test of the Perseus intercept fighter, so let's put on a good show."

902, "(fr)When you were selected for the 242nd Suicide Kings, you were singled out as a promising candidate for a command position. The officers who recommended you had faith in your potential to make an outstanding leader. Unfortunately, this assessment seems premature, at the very least.

I am disappointed in you, pilot. Though you probably fought well as an individual, you did not use your squadmates to the best advantage in this scenario. We lost Enif Station because you were placed in a situation you were ill-equipped to handle. That's not your fault. However, if you want to fly with a top-notch unit, you must learn the difference between doing an adequate job and going above and beyond the call of duty."

903, "(fr)Destroy beam turrets on hostile warships, and intercept enemy bombers. Order your squadmates to attack or protect targets you cannot cover."

904, "(fr)In your courageous defense of Enif Station, you were eyewitness to an historic moment: the first combat deployment of the GTVA Colossus. 

You and your wing also showed us what the Perseus intercept fighter can do. Against overwhelming odds, you repelled an attack against a facility of the utmost strategic importance for the Alliance. 

The commander of Enif Station personally extends his gratitude, pilot. I can see you'll make a fine addition to the Suicide Kings.

The Alliance has won battle after battle throughout the system, crushing the NTC Rapier, the NTC Explorer, and the NTD Normandy. These victories have stalled the rebel advance, and now with the help of the Colossus, we will push them back into the Polaris system, securing Epsilon Pegasi once and for all."

905, "(fr)For demonstrating exceptional skill in combat, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross."

907, "(fr)Destroy Cato"

908, "(fr)Destroy Conquest"

911, "(fr)Enif Station here. NTF bombers are closing in!"

912, "(fr)More rebel bombers inbound! Seek and destroy!"

913, "(fr)All civilian transports have departed safely."

914, "(fr)Return to base pilots. Mission accomplished."

915, "(fr)We have lost Enif Station! Repeat. We have lost Enif Station!"

916, "(fr)This is the GTFr Calypso. We have cleared Enif Station. Now engaging subspace drive."

917, "(fr)NTF fighters, you are firing upon a civilian vessel! Break off your attack!"

918, "(fr)Alpha, we need some fighter cover on the Calypso! Hold back the rebels so the civilians can escape!"

919, "(fr)The Calypso has been destroyed!"

920, "(fr)This is the Mannheim. We have set course for the Capella jump node. Activating jump drive now."

921, "(fr)Our transport is carrying civilian passengers! Your attack is in violation of the Beta Aquilae Convention!"

922, "(fr)Pilots, protect the Mannheim! The transport is under attack!"

923, "(fr)We've lost the Mannheim! Two hundred civilians were on board that transport!"

924, "(fr)Intercept the bombs before they hit the installation! We must not lose that base!"

925, "(fr)Command, this is Enif Station! A new wing of bombers has jumped in! Request immediate fighter cover!"

926, "(fr)This is Enif Station. We have sustained moderate damage. All breached levels have been sealed off. Engineering reports the situation is under control."

927, "(fr)Enif Station here, Command. Hull integrity is falling, and all decks report heavy casualties. General evacuation now in progress. Deploying escape pods."

928, "(fr)This is Enif Station! All systems going critical!"

929, "(fr)Well done. The NTC Cato has been destroyed!"

930, "(fr)We have defeated the Hawkwood!"

931, "(fr)The Conquest has been obliterated!"

932, "(fr)Our forces have eliminated the Decatur!"

933, "(fr)This is Enif Station. We thank you for your help, pilots. You've done a commendable job out here."

934, "(fr)All allied ships return to base. This operation is a total failure."

935, "(fr)I'm reading an incoming jump signature! Configuration unknown!"

936, "(fr)Command! There's a massive warship now emerging from subspace!"

937, "(fr)Verify IFF status, Command!"

938, "(fr)IFF status is friendly. Meet the Colossus, the largest space-faring warship ever constructed."

939, "(fr)This is the GTVA Colossus. Fighters stand clear of hostile warships. All batteries, fire at will."

940, "(fr)Colossus, maintain your current position. You will defend Enif Station until relieved."

941, "(fr)Into the Maelstrom "

942, "(fr)The 242nd escorts a supply convoy through a rebel-infested asteroid field as they rendezvous with the Colossus."

943, "(fr)The 242nd will escort a supply convoy as it makes its rendezvous with the $f GTVA $f Colossus. As we prepare the $f Colossus for the allied counterattack, we must handle the logistics of supplying and maintaining this warship. Convoys of transports, gas miners, and freighters have been deployed for this purpose."

944, "(fr)The $f Colossus will jump in and rendezvous with your convoy at the Capella jump node, located on the far side of an asteroid field. The area has been the site of intense fighting and rebel activity. Intelligence believes the rebels might attempt to attack our supply convoys rather than challenge the $f Colossus directly."

945, "(fr)You will be leading Alpha wing, the main escort component. Your mission is to defend the $f GTFr $f Parracombe, the $f GTG $f Avila, and the $f GVG $f Jooyun. The $f Avila and $f Jooyun are mining vessels designed to collect fuel from gas giants for the reactors that power the $f Colossus."

946, "(fr)The Vasudans have dispatched a wing of Serapis fighters to guard the $f Jooyun. You do not have command over this unit. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings are responsible for the $f Jooyun's safety. Eighteen months of civil war are beginning to strain Terran-Vasudan relations, especially in contested systems. See to it the $f Jooyun survives."

947, "(fr)Excellent job, pilot. The convoy made its rendezvous with the Colossus without losing a single ship. As the other freighters and gas miners transfer their payload to the Colossus, the Alliance is making final preparations for our attack against Admiral Koth and the NTD Repulse. A demonstration of our ultimate weapon should force the rebel leadership to reconsider their territorial ambitions.  

GTVA units throughout the system report a successful, coordinated strike against NTF targets. Command is confident the long stalemate in Epsilon Pegasi will soon come to a favorable resolution. "

948, "(fr)Admiral Petrarch and the 242nd have issued a formal apology to the Vasudans for the loss of the Jooyun. Be thankful, pilot, that we no longer live in an era in which an incident such as this could ignite an all-out war between our species. The GTVA is strong, and we have moved beyond the misunderstandings of the past. However, the destruction of an allied ship under our protection is an embarrassment to the squadron. That this happened under your leadership should give you pause. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

949, "(fr)Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you.  The bombers must be your first priority. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters.  Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

950, "(fr)Though our mission was overall a success, we lost the Parracombe. The destruction of a single freighter will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

951, "(fr)Though our mission was overall a success, we lost the Avila. The destruction of a single gas miner will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

952, "(fr)The NTF decimated our supply convoys, forcing Command to withdraw the Colossus and postpone our offensive against Admiral Koth and the Repulse. Your convoy lost all three vessels, a dismal failure by any measure. 

The news from the captial in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

953, "(fr)Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you. Prioritize bombers, then fighters, then turrets.  When the Maelstrom appears, you have a limited amount of time before it is within beam range of the convoy.  Use the 'K' key to target turrets. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters. Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

954, "(fr)The NTF decimated our supply convoys, with only a handful of freighters and gas miners surviving the well-orchestrated attack. Your convoy lost two out of three vessels, a failed outcome by any measure. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous.
"

955, "(fr)The survival of the Jooyun may be good news for our Vasudan allies, but the loss of the Parracombe and the Avila are nothing less than catastrophic. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

956, "(fr)By clearing out the rebel sentry guns in the asteroid field, you have significantly reduced the danger posed to future convoys on this route. Your initiative may save many lives."

957, "(fr)You destroyed the Maelstrom but failed to neutralize its forward beam turret first. Had you followed orders, you would have reduced the damage inflicted upon the convoy vessels. Though you have been granted responsibility as a wing leader, this does not privilege you to ignore Command's directives. This incident will be noted in your record."

969, "(fr)Your primary objective is to escort the convoy. Do not let the rebels lure you away."

970, "(fr)This is the GTC Parapet. We have orders to blockade the Capella jump node, and we must not leave our position. We will sortie a wing of Perseus fighters to assist. Good luck, pilots."

971, "(fr)This is the GTVA Colossus. We have reached the rendezvous point. Now deploying transports. Theta wing, stand watch. "

972, "(fr)Thank you for your escort, Alpha wing."

973, "(fr)The rebels destroyed the Parracombe!"

974, "(fr)We've lost the Avila! I repeat. We've lost the Avila!"

978, "(fr)All units in the vicinity of the Capella jump node! Mayday! Our convoy is under attack! Repeat! Our convoy is under attack!"

979, "(fr)We're heading into the asteroid field now, Command. We're approximately twenty-three kilometers from the Capella jump node."

980, "(fr)I'm picking up hostile indicators on my radar. I can't get a lock. Might be nothing but asteroid interference."

981, "(fr)That's wishful thinking, pilot. Proceed with caution, and stay close to the convoy."

982, "(fr)Command, a rebel sentry gun has activated one thousand meters from the convoy!"

983, "(fr)Destroy it, but be careful, Alpha. The NTF seem to have an ambush in the works. Keep an eye out for hostile fighters."

984, "(fr)The rebels have sortied their Medusa bombers! Intercept them before they fire their missiles! We must protect that convoy!"

985, "(fr)Excellent work, pilots! We have destroyed the Maelstrom! "

986, "(fr)This is the GVG Jooyun. We are in dire need of fighter cover! All allied ships in the vicinity, please assist!"

987, "(fr)Avila here! Help us out, pilots! Hull integrity is below critical! "

988, "(fr)This is the Parracombe! We're taking a pounding here! Our hull cannot withstand a direct hit!"

989, "(fr)The convoy is lost!  Return to base immediately."

990, "(fr)Alpha, the situation is now under control. You may return to base."

991, "(fr)Feint! Parry! Riposte!"

992, "(fr)The 242nd attacks two rebel cruisers and their escorts in an attempt to lure the NTD Repulse into position.
"

993, "(fr)The Alliance will now take the $f Colossus on the offensive. We intend to break the back of the rebel fleet in Epsilon Pegasi, and the 242nd will play a pivotal role. Rear Admiral Koth is somewhere in this system. He will not commit the $h Repulse unless it's absolutely necessary. Your job is to create that necessity. "

994, "(fr)To lure Koth into our trap, the first phase of the mission will involve an attack against the rebel cruisers $h Majestic and $h Refute. They are defended by a complement of twelve Hercules-class fighters. With the speed and agility of the Perseus, you should be able to outmaneuver the Hercs and take them down."

995, "(fr)Your primary objective will be to eliminate the fighter escort. This will pave the way for the $f GTC $f Rampart and our bomber wings, which will deliver the main thrust of the strike. Our plan is to damage the rebel cruisers while presenting the smallest credible threat. "

996, "(fr)If the rebels think our force consists of nothing more than a Leviathan and a few errant bombers, they may capitalize on this advantage and sortie their fleet. For this reason, the cruisers must not be destroyed before their reinforcements enter the field of engagement. "

997, "(fr)If Koth sends in the $h Repulse to finish the job, Command will deploy the $f Colossus to strike the final blow. Your secondary objective will be to defend the $f Rampart during this phase of the battle. The cruiser will probably sustain damage from the earlier exchange. Good luck, Alpha."

998, "(fr)The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. In recognition of your contributions to the allied victory, you are hereby awarded the Epsilon Pegasi Liberation Medal. The GTVA Security Council and General Assembly extend their gratitude for your service.

Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for the 134th Barracuda squadron, a combat evaluation unit. I have forwarded your name as an outstanding candidate. The primary role of the 134th is the field testing of new technologies. In my estimation, you will excel in this challenging position.

However, I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for an extremely dangerous operation. If you choose to pursue this course, your assignment with the 134th will be waiting for you upon your return. The decision is yours, pilot."

999, "(fr)The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings have little cause to celebrate. 

The destruction of the Rampart reflects poorly on our unit and on your leadership. Command relies on our intercept squadrons to defend our warships. As a wing leader, you must learn how to take initiative, how to evaluate a crisis, and how to manage your squadmates. 

I have recommended your immediate transfer to the 134th Barracudas, a combat evaluation unit. At least the consequences of failure in such a squadron are not so grim. I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for a suicide mission. Of course, that decision is entirely up to you. "

1007, "(fr)Alpha, your primary objective is to intercept the escort. The rebel cruisers have anti-fighter guns. Stay out of range to avoid them. "

1008, "(fr)This is the GTC Rampart. We are powering down our beam cannons to minimize damage against the cruisers. If we destroy them by accident, our ruse is finished."

1009, "(fr)This is Zeta wing. We have delivered the goods and are returning to base.  "

1010, "(fr)Iota wing here. If we hit these cruisers any harder, there won't be any bait left for the trap. We're bugging out. "

1011, "(fr)Rampart now powering up primary batteries. Our beam cannons are back on line."

1012, "(fr)Sensors picking up a wing of rebel Lokis, designation Libra. Seek and destroy."

1013, "(fr)Proceed with caution, Alpha. Those anti-fighter beams have an effective range of fifteen hundred meters. Try to lure the escorts away from their cruisers."

1014, "(fr)This operation will mark the beginning of the end for the NTF. Well done, pilots. "

1015, "(fr)This is the GTVA Colossus. Admiral Koth, you are ordered to power down your vessel immediately and surrender. The Polaris jump node is blockaded. There is no escape!"

1016, "(fr)I have no intention of escaping, Colossus, nor will I surrender. Even if I send my crew to hell with you, this monstrosity will be destroyed!"

1017, "(fr)The Repulse has set a collision course for the Colossus!"

1018, "(fr)Admiral Koth's destroyer has jumped in! The NTD Repulse! The big fish has devoured our bait. Now sending in the Colossus."

1019, "(fr)Incoming jump signature! Friendly configuration! The Colossus is now on station!"

1020, "(fr)The Repulse is deploying its fighter wings. Alpha, we need to you to intercept! Destroy Aries wing!"

1021, "(fr)Don't be absurd, Koth! You are sacrificing ten thousand lives for nothing!"

1022, "(fr)Your cynicism appalls me, Colossus. I have ten thousand officers and crew willing to die for Neo-Terra! The tyranny of your regime is finished! Admiral Koth out!"

1023, "(fr)Evacuating forward decks four hundred through twelve hundred. Bringing turrets to bear. Auxiliary bridge, stand by. All hands brace for impact!"

1024, "(fr)Repulse objective neutralized. Colossus, what's your status?"

"

1034, "(fr)News from the Front

At 2150, the Colossus entered the Polaris system and neutralized the NTD Andronicus and the NTC Camisard, securing the jump node from Epsilon Pegasi. Meanwhile, the 13th Vasudan Battle Group has destroyed the NTD Cyrene and gained foothold in Sirius. Intelligence reports that Admiral Bosch and his elite guard have withdrawn to the rebel enclave of Regulus. 

Command anticipates a total allied victory in less than 30 days."

1035, "(fr)The Subspace Portal

Dr. Hargrove's task force has determined that the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis was constructed by the Ancients, an extinct civilization discovered near the end of the Great War. Artifacts excavated in the Altair system contained data that enabled the GTA and PVN to destroy the SD Lucifer. Many Terran and Vasudan systems once belonged to the Ancients' empire, which the Shivans obliterated eight thousand years ago. The portal has been renamed Knossos, after the Earth's Minoan civilization."

1036, "(fr)The Deneb Connection

Intelligence has learned that Bosch acquired Ancient materials from an excavation site in the Deneb system. These artifacts somehow enabled Bosch to locate and activate the Knossos portal. This explains the presence of the admiral's command ship in the Deneb asteroid belt. Bosch then sent the NTC Trinity into Gamma Draconis to activate the portal, which lured the Shivans into that system. 

We do not know Bosch's motives or what the Shivans are doing in the nebula."

1037, "(fr)Nostos

Allied scientists studying the portal remain optimistic about the potential for this technology. In five to ten years, we might be able to restore contact with Earth or create new jump nodes to unexplored regions of the galaxy. For this reason, the portal must remain open for as long as possible. 

Command has issued a standing order to destroy the device should a full-scale invasion be imminent."

1038, "(fr)Our Objectives

The destruction of the Ravana has intensified Shivan activity in the nebula. The Shivan fleet appears to be smaller than the armada we defeated three decades ago, and our improved technology gives us a tactical advantage. However, with the possibility of uncharted jump nodes leading to more Shivan-infested systems, we cannot know with any certainty the full extent of the enemy force. 

A miscalculation on our part could unleash the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1039, "(fr)New Technologies

The Aquitaine will spearhead the next phase of our exploration and containment operation in the nebula. To help us achieve our objectives, the Alliance has developed new technologies, including Advanced Warning And Control Systems, or AWACS, and gas mining vessels to gather deuterium for our fusion reactors. 

Prototypes of these new tactical weapons and fighters will be deployed pending successful completion of field tests. The 134th Barracudas will be conducting these combat exercises near the Gamma Draconis jump node."

1040, "(fr)GTW ML-70 Morning Star

Two next-generation weapons are now available: the Morning Star and the EMP missile. The GTW ML-70 Morning Star improves upon the Flail gun developed during the Great War. Recent advances in high-temperature optics enable the primary focusing chamber of the Morning Star to produce a more coherent charge. Though an energy weapon, the Morning Star has a powerful kinetic effect on its target."

1041, "(fr)EMP Missile

The EMP missile interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within the blast radius of the warhead. The detonation scrambles targeting data and jams communications. Tactically, the EMP is an effective anti-bomber weapon. It prevents these craft from acquiring aspect lock and temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight."

1042, "(fr)Welcome to the 134th Barracudas, pilot. I'm Commander Vincey, your squadron leader. The 134th is a combat evaluation unit, or CEU, which means we're among the first to test new ships and weapons in the field. While we carry out our missions, engineers will gather data on the systems we've been assigned to test."

1043, "(fr)In this mission, our primary objective is to escort two Triton-class freighters, the $f Erinpura and the $f Vauban. They will enter the nebula at the Gamma Draconis node and travel to their waypoint, where they will rendezvous with the $f GTCv $f Warspite. Their cargo is the new Target Acquisition and Guidance missile system. "

1044, "(fr)The $f GTA $f Lucidity will provide AWACS support for this mission. With its powerful sensor array, the $f Lucidity will transmit targeting data to your fighter, effectively increasing your sensor range. The 134th will be the first to test the system in the nebula."

1045, "(fr)Now keep in mind that the C in CEU stands for Combat. These aren't controlled laboratory experiments. Shivan activity has intensified, so you can expect to engage some $h Maras and $h Cains out there. If the action gets too intense, call in reinforcements at your discretion. Good luck, pilot."

1046, "(fr)Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation. As we speak, analysts are reviewing the data from our flight recorders. The entire squadron has been grounded pending the conclusion of this inquiry.

Command considers this deployment of the AWACS to be a total failure."

1047, "(fr)It is essential that you concentrate your efforts on enemy bombers. You also have reinforcements at your disposal. You would be well advised to make efficient use of them."

1048, "(fr)Though we lost a freighter in this engagement, the combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios. On the other hand, your unit's failure to protect the AWACS indicates that more effective leadership may be required here."

1049, "(fr)Both the Erinpura and the Vauban survived the Shivan attack. The combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios. On the other hand, your unit's failure to protect the AWACS indicates that more effective leadership may be required here."

1050, "(fr)Both the Erinpura and the Vauban survived the Shivan ambush. The combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite on this exercise. 

Command rates the initial deployment of the AWACS a complete success. Our improved sensor capability gave us the tactical advantage we required to respond quickly and decisively to the Shivan attack. 

Prepare your wing for your next sortie, pilot. The TAG missile combat field test begins at 0315."

1051, "(fr)You have flown an excellent mission."

1052, "(fr)Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation. As we speak, analysts are reviewing the data from our flight recorders. The entire squadron has been grounded pending the conclusion of this inquiry.

"

1083, "(fr)The 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile. Captain Forsythe of the Warspite has requested you specifically for this mission, so you must have made quite an impression on your last sortie. The Warspite will supervise this combined arms exercise."

1084, "(fr)The 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile. This will be the first deployment of this system in an actual combat exercise. Our laboratory simulations indicate it has significant potential as a tactical weapon. "

1085, "(fr)When you hit a target with the TAG warhead, the missile's beacon will illuminate the target for allied capital ships within range. All available firepower will be brought to bear for a quick resolution. This technology could be a decisive advantage for the $f GTVA. In this exercise, we will test the prototype TAG-A."

1086, "(fr)Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your TAGs. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness. The $f Lucidity will provide AWACS coverage.  "

1087, "(fr)Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your TAGs. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness. "

1088, "(fr)For this mission, you'll be flying a refurbished Ulysses space superiority fighter, specially modified for this exercise. The Ulysses is a Great War antique, but the fighter still handles well, and the modifications will enable TAG engineers to monitor the progress of the exercise. "

1089, "(fr)Though this exercise did not proceed as planned, the 134th met the challenge head-on and defended our warships admirably. 

Overall, this field deployment of the TAG missile exceeded our expectations. Research and Development is now working on improvements to the TAG-A prototype, including an aspect-seeking warhead and a more maneuverable projectile. These enhancements should make the TAG a versatile weapon for our tactical wings."

1090, "(fr)The destruction of the Warspite was a senseless tragedy. The lives of Captain Forsythe and his crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise. The 134th was called upon to get our warships out of a difficult situation, and we failed. As leader of Alpha wing, re-evaluate this scenario carefully. What could you have done to save the Warspite?"

1091, "(fr)You must make careful use of every TAG missile you are alotted.  Since they are unguided missiles you are advised to get as close to your target as possible.  Once an enemy is TAG'ed move clear quickly so you don't take friendly fire."

1092, "(fr)The destruction of the Lucidity was a senseless tragedy. The lives of its crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise.

1122, "(fr)I am transmitting the coordinates of the Aquitaine's current position. Return to base immediately. You are badly damaged."

1123, "(fr)Listen to me! There's no way we can stop them this time! Shut down the portal before it's too late! There's something out there, Command! Please! "

1124, "(fr)Kappa 3, do you copy? Please respond. I repeat. Do you copy?"

1126, "(fr)Proving Grounds"

1127, "(fr)The 134th participates in a field exercise with the new Pegasus stealth fighter.
"

1128, "(fr)In this mission, the 134th will participate in a test of the new Pegasus-class stealth fighter, developed for allied operations in the nebula. The unusual design of the Pegasus minimizes the EM signature emitted by the fighter, making it all but impossible to detect with sensors. This exercise will be the first simulation of the Pegasus under combat conditions in the nebula environment."

1129, "(fr)Alpha wing, your objective is to defend the $f GTC $f Oberon, a decommissioned Fenris cruiser. The $f Oberon has served the Alliance since the Great War, and most of its systems have been stripped down to repair other cruisers in circulation. Flying the Pegasus prototypes, $h Delta wing will attack the $f Oberon. Your job is to repel their offensive."

1130, "(fr)Your weapons will be neutralized for the duration of the test. Though you may fire your lasers and missiles, they will inflict only superficial damage against $h Delta wing. Engineers on board the $f GTD $f Aquitaine will monitor the progress of the exercise and gather data to verify the stealth capability and combat potential of the Pegasus."

1131, "(fr)The Shivans destroyed the Aquitaine. Without this ship, our operations in the nebula are in jeopardy. Though we were outnumbered and outgunned, the Aquitaine went down on our watch. The 10,000 officers and crew who perished were our friends and comrades. The 134th is the disgrace of the allied fleet. 

Because we serve on the front lines, the brass think it's our duty to take the fall for their mistakes. As your squadron leader, I will testify on your behalf. More wings should have been deployed to cover the Aquitaine's retreat. However, until Command completes its inquiry, you will be stripped of your wings and held in custody. You are dismissed, pilot."

1132, "(fr)Bombers should be your highest priority when protecting the Aquitaine."

1133, "(fr)Well done, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node.  The Moloch and its fighters inflicted severe damage, and repair crews are now working to get the destroyer back on line. Nevertheless, your actions saved thousands of lives.

The 64th Raptors are in need of bomber pilots. I've recommended that you be transferred. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1134, "(fr)Excellent work, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node. For saving a capital ship of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance from imminent destruction, you are hereby awarded the Order of Galatea. Congratulations.

The 64th Raptors need a wing leader, and I think you are just the pilot for the job. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1156, "(fr)Target profile is razor thin. Hard to hit at medium range."

1157, "(fr)Alpha, can you target Delta wing?"

1158, "(fr)Negative, Command. Even at point blank range my sensors pick up nothing."

1159, "(fr)Good. How are you holding up, Delta?"

1160, "(fr)Shielding and armor have a low damage threshold."

1161, "(fr)Speed and maneuverability are well above average."

1162, "(fr)Limited offensive capability. An excellent reconnaissance fighter in my estimation."

1163, "(fr)Delta wing has inflicted moderate damage against the Oberon. Stay on them, Alpha. Don't lose them in the fog."

1164, "(fr)The Oberon has sustained heavy damage. The stealth fighters are getting the best of you, Alpha."

1165, "(fr)The Oberon's hull integrity has fallen below critical. Looks like a victory for Delta wing."

1166, "(fr)That's enough for the first test, pilots. Our engineers have gathered important data. Good work attacking the Fenris, Delta. You caught Alpha wing off guard."

1167, "(fr)Excellent work, pilots. Our engineers have gathered valuable data. Good work defending the Fenris, Alpha wing."

1168, "(fr)We will now begin the second test."

1169, "(fr)Abort the exercise! Repeat! Abort the exercise! Sensors are reading incoming hostiles! Delta wing, return to the Aquitaine on the double."

1170, "(fr)Alpha wing, your primary and secondary weapons have been rearmed. Hold off the Shivans as the Aquitaine withdraws."

1171, "(fr)Roger that, Command. Engaging fusion drives. Distance from the node is 4500 meters. We will reach our jump point in 6 minutes."

1172, "(fr)This is the Aquitaine. Shivan warheads have impacted our hull. We are sustaining heavy damage from the Moloch's main gun."

"

1180, "(fr)Bosch's Gambit

We have received news of an alarming development on the civil war front. Massing his forces in the Regulus system, Admiral Bosch outmaneuvered the Colossus and its battle group. The rebel armada is now en route for the Gamma Draconis system, via Polaris, Epsilon Pegasi, and Capella. 

Their final destination: the Knossos subspace portal."

1181, "(fr)Running the Gauntlet

Allied forces destroyed a number of NTF warships as they ran our gauntlet of jump node blockades. However, the rebels have sufficient firepower to threaten our positions in Gamma Draconis. 

The Colossus and its battle group are in close pursuit, neutralizing enemy stragglers. We must hold Gamma Draconis until these reinforcements arrive."

1182, "(fr)On the Barricades

Our squadrons will assist with the blockade of the Capella node. As the rebels begin their incursion, our objective will be to inflict as much damage as possible. The second phase will involve a counterstrike against enemy rallying positions, where the rebels will gather to coordinate their final attack. 

We must diminish the NTF's offensive capability before our confrontation at the node."

1183, "(fr)Rebellion's End

This campaign may prove to be the admiral's final gambit. Whether or not Bosch reaches the portal, the NTF regime and its domination of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are effectively over. Command has disclosed neither the motives behind Bosch's actions nor the consequences should the admiral succeed. 

We do know that 18 months of carnage and terror will soon come to an end."

1184, "(fr)Artemis Bomber

The Aquitaine has just received four wings of the new GTB Artemis, the Alliance's next-generation light bomber. The most agile ship of its class, the Artemis will carry the Cyclops torpedo, our modified anti-cruiser warhead. I have reassigned pilots to the 64th Raptors. This squadron will play a bomber and heavy assault role in the upcoming operation."

1185, "(fr)Prometheus S

The Artemis will be armed with the new Prometheus cannon. Our nebula gas miners have gathered sufficient resources to resume production of the GTW-5 Prometheus S. The S-type is based on the original design of the Prometheus cannon. With high marks for shield and hull damage, the Prometheus was our weapon of choice in the Great War."

1186, "(fr)This is Commander Beckett, leader of the 64th Raptors Bomber Squadron. At 0457, NTF warships entered the Gamma Draconis system and engaged our blockade. So far we've taken down the NTC Absalon, the NTC Cunaxa, and several troop transports.  Admiral Petrarch has called in the 64th to assist."

1187, "(fr)The Vasudans are leading the blockade with the $f GVD $f Hedetet, a Typhon-class destroyer. The Alliance has also set up a network of five $f Mjolnir RBCs, or Remote Beam Cannons. These unmanned experimental weapon platforms discharge anti-warship beams to complement the defense of a strategic target."

1188, "(fr)The $h NTF fleet will enter through the Capella jump node. Each warship will then jump to a rallying point within the Gamma Draconis system. In the interval between jumps, they will re-energize their subspace drives. Your role will be to neutralize the warships with your Cyclops torpedoes."

1189, "(fr)The $h Iceni has already slipped through our defenses, but we will make every effort to track Bosch down before the rebels rally their forces and attack. According to Intelligence, the $h NTD $h Uhuru, the $h NTC $h Pax, the $h NTC $h Liberty, and the $h NTC $h Undaunted have entered the subspace node and are heading for the blockade."

1190, "(fr)The 64th Raptors are the disgrace of the Aquitaine and the GTVA. Every warship that ran our blockade threatens our positions in the Gamma Draconis system. Though we have the strength to crush the rebellion, our failure here will cost lives and resources we should not have to sacrifice.  

Admiral Petrarch has grounded the 64th until further notice. Our bombers will be reassigned to the 107th Ravens. Dismissed, pilot."

1191, "(fr)Coordinate your squadmates to attack the critical targets."

1192, "(fr)Excellent work, pilot. With our blockade of the Capella jump node, the Alliance has achieved a major victory. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th negated a significant component of the rebel fleet. The Raptors neutralized all hostile warships that crossed our lines. No other squadron can make that claim.

Our unit will be redeployed ASAP. Report to the ready room on the double."

1193, "(fr)Good work, pilot. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th reduced the offensive capability of the NTF fleet. Our chances of minimizing allied casualties in Gamma Draconis have improved significantly.

1203, "(fr)Good work, pilots! Don't smoke 'em yet. We've got more trouble on the way."

1204, "(fr)The NTD Uhuru has jumped! Now en route to rallying position."

1205, "(fr)Alpha 1, a Deimos-class corvette, the NTCv Pax, has entered the system."

1206, "(fr)The Pax is going down!"

1207, "(fr)The Pax has escaped! This is a blockade, pilots! We've got to shut the rebels down!"

1208, "(fr)The NTC Liberty now entering the system. Aeolus-class cruiser. Evade the Loki escort, Alpha!"

1209, "(fr)That's a confirmed kill! We've got more hostiles jumping in!"

1210, "(fr)Heads up, Alpha! The NTC Undaunted, a Leviathan-class cruiser, has entered the fray."

1211, "(fr)Stay focused, Alpha. The battle's not over yet."

1212, "(fr)The Undaunted has jumped out. Every ship that gets away means trouble later, pilots!"

1213, "(fr)The Liberty has jumped to subspace. Bet we'll see that scrap heap again!"

1214, "(fr)Here comes the NTF Inspiration, Alpha. Hit them hard, and make it count!"

1215, "(fr)Inspiration objective neutralized! Stand clear of the blast!"

1216, "(fr)The Inspiration has run the blockade!"

"

1223, "(fr)Reconnaissance has located one of the $h NTF's rallying points within the Gamma Draconis system. The rebels are preparing to execute a coordinated strike to acquire control of the Knossos subspace portal. Intelligence believes the $h NTF has sufficient firepower to mount a credible offensive."

1224, "(fr)Your primary target is the $h Iceni, Bosch's command ship. The 64th Raptors will lead the strike. The Vasudans will sortie the $f GVC $f Hyksos and a wing of Serapis fighters to assist. We will deploy additional forces as they become available."

1225, "(fr)You are now authorized to carry the GTM-10 Piranhas. A third-generation version of the Synaptic bomb, the Piranha provides a high-explosive anti-fighter screen. Trigger the Piranha's detonation by pressing your launch button a second time."

1226, "(fr)You faced down fierce resistance and damaged the rebel fleet. The NTF has commenced its attack on the Knossos subspace portal, but the efforts of our squadron have significantly reduced their offensive capability. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also achieved major victories, though Admiral Bosch remains at large. This is the beginning of the end for the NTF."

1227, "(fr)Our inability to inflict significant damage against the rebel warships may compromise our defense of the Knossos subspace portal. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also failed to achieve decisive results. Though the Neo-Terran Front remains on the brink of collapse, we cannot afford to underestimate Bosch and his followers."

1228, "(fr)Coordinate your efforts with your squadmates. Keep them focused on critical targets."

1229, "(fr)We mourn the loss of our ships and crew. Many lives were lost in this battle that perhaps could have been saved had we been more vigilant. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, but this victory should not come at such a high price. The end of the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance. We have the Shivans to contend with, and for that battle, we will need every warship in the armada."

1230, "(fr)Use your squadmates to protect friendly craft."

1231, "(fr)Command is pleased we have succeeded in minimizing allied casualties throughout this operation. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, though a victory in the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance.

1241, "(fr)Either recon screwed up or Bosch jumped already."

1242, "(fr)Should we abort our attack, Command?"

1243, "(fr)Recon will track down the Iceni. Keep an eye out in case Bosch jumps in from another rallying point."

1244, "(fr)Roger, Command. We'll take em down!"

1245, "(fr)This is Epsilon wing of the 33rd fighter squadron, GVD Memphis. Escorting the Hyksos into position."

1246, "(fr)Pilots, the NTC Alba has run our blockade of the Capella jump node. We are tracking the vessel to your rallying point. The Alba will emerge from subspace momentarily."

1247, "(fr)Negative, pilots. Destroy the Vindicator. Neutralize any rebel ship that reaches the rallying point. We'll intercept Bosch at the portal."

1248, "(fr)Command, we need more firepower here!"

1249, "(fr)We are deploying Delta wing and the GTC Diomedes to assist. Please stand by."

1250, "(fr)This is the Diomedes. Engaging the rebels now."

1251, "(fr)An Aeolus-class cruiser has jumped in! Watch the flak guns on that ship, pilots!"

1252, "(fr)The Yoshitomo has been neutralized!"

1253, "(fr)We have destroyed the Alba!"

1254, "(fr)We've taken down the Vindicator!"

1255, "(fr)We've lost the Hyksos!"

1256, "(fr)The rebels have vaporized the Diomedes!"

1257, "(fr)The Vindicator is jumping out! The rebels are commencing their attack! Abort mission and return to base, pilots!"

1258, "(fr)The Vindicator is making the jump to subspace! No cause for alarm, pilots. I think we hit 'em hard enough."

1259, "(fr)The NTF have commenced their attack on the subspace portal! All ships return to base!"

1260, "(fr)Endgame"

1261, "(fr)The 64th must intercept a rebel attack at the Knossos subspace portal."

1262, "(fr)The $h NTF has attacked our warships defending the Knossos. We repelled their first offensive, but the $h NTC $h Alexandria reached the portal and made the jump into the nebula. We believe the rebels are regrouping to launch a second assault. Command has positioned the $f GTA $f Monitor to hold off the attack, and reinforcements are on their way."

1263, "(fr)The 64th will play a fighter role in this mission. The $h NTF have a few Zeus and Medusa wings remaining, so your objective will be to engage all rebel bombers and neutralize their fighter escort. The $f Colossus has engaged the $h NTC $h Vanguard and the $h NTCv $h Congreve. We will move the $f Colossus into position as soon as this battle has been resolved."

1264, "(fr)Keep an eye out for the $h NTF $h Iceni. If this vessel emerges within range, you are authorized to engage and destroy it. Bosch has eluded our forces since he entered the Gamma Draconis system. Though we anticipate Bosch will either attempt to gain control of the Knossos or enter the portal itself, be prepared for any development."

1265, "(fr)This is the endgame, pilot. Bosch's $h Neo-Terran $h Front has been crushed.  Only the die-hard fanatics remain. They'll fight to the death and take as many of us with them as they can. We have every confidence in your ability to get the job done. Good luck."

1266, "(fr)The Aquitaine now has available the GTM-4a Tornado, a modified version of the Hornet missile. With improved fire control systems and guidance computers, the Tornado can fire more often and with greater accuracy than the Hornet. Be advised the Tornado will fail to arm its ordnance properly if aspect lock has not been achieved."

1267, "(fr)You are also authorized to carry the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. The Infyrno is a remote detonation missile. Hit your secondary trigger a second time to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the warhead's distance.  The Infyrno will release multiple submunitions with ultra-high explosive charges."

1268, "(fr)The Alliance charged the 64th Raptors with the duty of defending the Monitor, the Fortune, and the thousands of lives on board these warships. We failed our mission. Though these officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA, there is no hero's welcome for our squadron. Our job was to get these men and women home alive.

I am recommending your immediate transfer out of this unit. The Admiral and I believe you might be better suited to pilot a support ship, a freighter, or maybe a transport. A tactical squadron is no place for officers who cannot get the job done. There's too much at stake here."

1269, "(fr)Bombers should be your highest priority."

1270, "(fr)The Alliance mourns the loss of the GTC Monitor. Thousands of courageous officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA. We as a squadron must ask ourselves what could have been done to avert this tragedy.

Aken Bosch has eluded capture once again. Jumping in near the Knossos was a risky maneuver, but it enabled him to reach the nebula. Rebel saboteurs on board the Colossus temporarily shut down fire control to give the Iceni a window of opportunity. These operatives are now in custody.

You have been reassigned. Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for pilots to participate in an officer exchange program with the Vasudans. The Admiral and I believe a tour of duty with Vasudan Tactical Command may do you some good."

1292, "(fr)Intercept Aquarius wing! Neutralize their warheads before they impact the Monitor!"

1293, "(fr)This is the GTVA Colossus. Monitor, you are relieved. Great job holding down the Knossos, Captain."

1294, "(fr)Roger that, Colossus. We're clearing out."

1295, "(fr)And keep an eye on the fighter escort! Don't let those bandits flank you!"

1303, "(fr)Negative. We'll send in a search party to find the Admiral."

1304, "(fr)Command, should we pursue the Iceni through the portal?"

"

1308, "(fr)Twilight

This is Admiral Khafre, commanding officer of the GVD Psamtik, 13th Vasudan Battle Group.

The NTF rebellion is over. Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are now under allied control, and we begin the process of rebuilding these systems after 18 months of bloodshed. NTF officers responsible for the genocide of Vasudan civilians will face a war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. GTVA warships in the nebula are now hunting down the Iceni and the other blockade runners."

1309, "(fr)Welcome, Terrans

For those Terran pilots joining us in Gamma Draconis, welcome aboard. Your reassignment is part of an officer exchange program to foster better cooperation and understanding. You will serve in Vasudan wings and pilot Vasudan fighters. Our crews have modified our craft to accommodate Terran pilots.

We as an alliance have come a long way since the Terran-Vasudan War, and initiatives such as this can only strengthen the bond between our species."

1310, "(fr)The Second Front

With the rebellion defeated, we are now able to focus on our exploration and containment operation in the nebula. 

We have three objectives in this theatre: to locate uncharted Shivan jump nodes, to destroy all hostiles encountered, and to apprehend Admiral Aken Bosch. 

We begin launching our squadrons at 3230, Vasudan Galactic Time."

1311, "(fr)Maxim

The Psamtik has received a shipment of the new GTW-66 Maxim Gun. The Maxim is by definition an energy weapon, though it behaves like a mass-driver, accelerating caseless uranium slugs along its smoothbore barrel. The Maxim has difficulty penetrating shield defenses but its effect on hull plating is devastating. 

Use the Maxim at your discretion."

1312, "(fr)Lamprey

You have also been issued the GTW-83 Lamprey Cannon. A second-generation Leech gun, the Lamprey affects the energy systems of your target, draining its weapon, shield, and afterburner reserves. Coupled with a balanced hull and shield damaging weapon, the Lamprey is highly effective against smaller vessels."

1313, "(fr)Mekhu HL-7

All Terrans be advised that Vasudan fighters and bombers may be equipped with the Mekhu HL-7. A modified version of the Subach HL-7, the Mekhu design has been optimized for the reactor grids of Vasudan craft to increase the cannon's rate of fire."

1314, "(fr)Welcome to the 203rd, Terran. I am Commander Habu, squadron leader. Our unit has served the Emperor since the war between our species, nearly five decades ago. I understand you were among the pilots who assisted our counter-insurgency effort in the Deneb system. We are honored to fight by your side, pilot. You will lead Alpha wing."

1315, "(fr)Allied Command has ordered the 203rd to nullify a gas mining operation in the vicinity of our secured perimeter. Reconnaissance has located six $h Rahu-class miners, defended by a screen of sentry guns. Your primary objective is to destroy the miners. Your secondary objective is to neutralize the sentry guns."

1316, "(fr)Be advised the shockwave of a gas miner explosion will have a destructive radius greater than that of a ship of comparable size. As the hull integrity of your target approaches zero, put as much distance as possible between yourself and the miner. We believe the Shivans are using the nebular gas for energy. Good luck."

1317, "(fr)Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

If our preliminary assessment is correct, the Shivans are preparing a full-scale incursion. However, the Sathanas could pose a much greater threat than the Lucifer superdestroyer of the Great War. Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

You performed well in this mission, Terran. Though we damaged their gas-mining operation, we now have greater concerns to attend to."

1318, "(fr)A Vasudan never leaves the field of battle without authorization from a superior officer. Your cowardice jeopardized the lives of our brothers and sisters. You are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance. You will be taken into custody and handed over to the Terran 3rd Battle Group authority, where you will face a court martial. You are a disgrace to your species, Terran."

1319, "(fr)Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

Your valor and skill are formidable, Terran. Your commanders spoke very highly of you, and we see now their praise was not exaggerated. You risked your life above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill your objectives, regardless of the danger.  We'll make a Vasudan of you yet."

1338, "(fr)Perimeter objective neutralized. All guns are down."

1339, "(fr)We have destroyed one Rahu-class miner. Five remain. Seek and destroy."

1340, "(fr)Disengage now, Tatenen! Break off and retreat! We're pulling you out!"

1341, "(fr)All units, defend the Tatenen! We'll resume our attack once we eliminate this threat. Intercept and destroy!"

1342, "(fr)All units, we are picking up an unusual jump signature in your immediate vicinity.  Seek and identify."

1343, "(fr)A Monster in the Mist"

1344, "(fr)Flying the Ptah stealth fighter, Alpha 1 of the 203rd must scan the subsystems of the Sathanas.
"

1345, "(fr)Alpha 1, you will pilot the new Ptah-class stealth fighter. Your mission is to scan the subsystems of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. Allied Intelligence has requested data regarding the navigation, weapons, sensors, and communications subsystems of the warship."

1346, "(fr)To scan a subsystem, you must first select it with the subsystem targeting control. Then close to 150 meters to scan. The lead indicator must be in the center of your reticle. Maintain that position until the scan indicator has moved across your target view. Average scanning time is five seconds."

1347, "(fr)The design of the stealth fighter will minimize your EM signature, though we have not tested the stealth fighter against Shivan targets. Avoid flying into the line of sight of enemy fighters, and keep moving as much as possible. The longer you stay in one position, the greater your risk of detection. Firing weapons will also reveal your position."

1348, "(fr)To create a diversion, the $f GVCv $f Maahes will direct an assault toward the stern of the warship. This will draw enemy fire away from you and the systems you must target. The $h Sathanas has a smaller concentration of turrets in this quadrant, but you must complete your mission quickly. The corvette will not last long against the Juggernaut."

1349, "(fr)Very impressive, Terran. Though Vasudan Tactical Command had its doubts, our deployment of the Ptah-class stealth fighter was successful. Against difficult odds, you acquired subsystem scans of the Shivan Juggernaut. 

GTVI analysts are now reviewing the data, searching for a weakness in the Juggernaut's defenses. Once Intelligence completes its report, Allied Command will outline our strategy for neutralizing the Sathanas threat."

1350, "(fr)The operation did not proceed as smoothly as we had anticipated. However, you survived a difficult engagement and scanned 3 of the 4 subsystems. Though we are lacking 25% of the requested data, our analysts assure us your performance was satisfactory, under the circumstances. Perhaps a Vasudan pilot would have been more successful, given the unusual design of our stealth fighter."

1351, "(fr)The mission did not proceed as smoothly as we planned. With data acquired for only 2 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1352, "(fr)This mission was a complete failure. With data acquired for only 1 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1353, "(fr)This mission was a disaster, pilot. You failed to scan any of the Juggernaut's subsystems, and our analysts have no information to plan a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1354, "(fr)The Sathanas vaporized the Maahes, killing all on board. Perhaps if you had completed your objectives in a more timely fashion, this tragedy might have been averted. Of course, Command must accept its share of the blame for failing to assess the status of the engagement."

1355, "(fr)Your attack against the turrets of the Sathanas has yielded important data regarding the relative strength of the Juggernaut's weapons. This information should prove useful."

1356, "(fr)For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of your own life, you are hereby awarded the Medal of Valor."

1366, "(fr)The subsystem's lead indicator must also be in your reticle. The average scanning time is five seconds. If the scan cycle is aborted, you will have to make another attempt."

1367, "(fr)The Maahes has already engaged the Sathanas. You'll have to move quickly."

1368, "(fr)This is the Maahes. We have sustained damage from the juggernaut's cannons. We cannot distract the Shivan force indefinitely."

1369, "(fr)Hang in there, Maahes. We need more time. Alpha 1, let's get a move on!"

1370, "(fr)Command, this is the Maahes. Our hull cannot withstand another salvo. We must withdraw immediately."

1384, "(fr)However, be advised you may return to base at any time."

1385, "(fr)The Sathanas has departed. Return to base, pilot."

1386, "(fr)Speaking in Tongues"

1387, "(fr)The 203rd attacks a Shivan warship in an attempt to lure the Sathanas into position."

1388, "(fr)Your reconnaissance of the $h Sathanas identified weak points in the Juggernaut's defenses. However, exploiting these weaknesses will require firepower that can be provided only by the main guns of our capital ships. The $f GVD $f Psamtik, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine, and the $f GVD $f Toeris are standing by. Your mission is to lure the $h Sathanas into position."

1389, "(fr)In the first phase, you will attack the $h SC $h Rephaim, a Rakshasa-class warship. Our recon flights have located the $h Rephaim near the allied secure zone. The cruiser is accompanied by two wings comprised of Mara-class fighters. Our analysis of the $h Rephaim's flight pattern suggests the vessel is patrolling the region."

1390, "(fr)Your first task is to eliminate the fighter escort. This must be achieved quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Once the escort has been neutralized, call in Delta wing. The bombers will help you destroy the $h Rephaim. If necessary, your wing will need to incapacitate the cruiser's beam turrets to clear a path for your bombers."

1391, "(fr)We anticipate the attack on the $h Rephaim will bring Shivan reinforcements.  Your squadron is charged with the duty of engaging and destroying these hostiles until the $h Sathanas arrives. Sigma wing will also be available to assist, once these bombers have returned from their current sortie."

1392, "(fr)The upgraded Target Acquisition and Guidance warhead is now available. The TAG-B, an aspect-seeking missile, features an improved shock-resistant substrate that enables the beacon to transmit data with greater precision.  The $f GVCv $f Sopedu will provide fire support for this operation."

1393, "(fr)The Alliance will execute simultaneous, coordinated strikes against Shivan positions in the nebula. For this reason, our destroyers will not be deployed unless the $h Sathanas appears in your field of engagement.  If we fail to lure the $h Sathanas, or if the Juggernaut engages our forces elsewhere, we will abort this mission."

1394, "(fr)At 0745 hours, reconnaissance sighted the Sathanas juggernaut heading for the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. Because of the immediate risk to our home systems, Command has aborted the plan to attack the juggernaut in the nebula. All allied forces have been ordered to withdraw immediately to Gamma Draconis. Further orders will be issued upon our arrival. We have no conclusive data regarding the transmissions exchanged between the Iceni and the Rephaim."

1397, "(fr)<Incoming Transmission>"

1398, "(fr)Command, we have hostiles on radar, but we cannot acquire a target."

1399, "(fr)Are you able to see anything?"

1400, "(fr)Negative. No visual contact."

1401, "(fr)Maintain your current heading, pilots."

1402, "(fr)Command, we're picking up an unusual transmission."

1403, "(fr)Can you identify it, Alpha?"

1404, "(fr)The transmission is coming from the Rephaim!"

1405, "(fr)That's impossible! This is an allied channel!"

1406, "(fr)Confirmed. We are receiving a transmission from the Shivan warship!"

1407, "(fr)Command, I have targeted the Iceni! The rebel command ship is in the field of engagement."

1408, "(fr)All units, engage the Shivans! Stand clear of the Iceni! Do not attack that ship!"

1409, "(fr)Acknowledged, Command. We will not engage the Iceni."

1410, "(fr)The Iceni has activated its subspace drive!"

1411, "(fr)Now deploying the Thutmose!"

1412, "(fr)We have destroyed the Rephaim! Excellent work, pilots."

1413, "(fr)This is the Thutmose. We are now engaging the enemy."

1414, "(fr)We are under attack! We have sustained heavy damage! We require assistance, Command!"

1415, "(fr)Alpha 1, get some cover on the Thutmose!"

1416, "(fr)The corvette has been destroyed!"

1417, "(fr)Incoming jump signature! Cain-class warship! Designation, Thaumiel."

1418, "(fr)We have nullified the Thaumiel. Job well done, pilots."

1419, "(fr)Incoming warship! It's a Moloch-class corvette, designation Golab!"

1420, "(fr)Shivan reinforcements could arrive at any time. Rearm if you need to, pilots."

1421, "(fr)No sign of the Sathanas! We must keep up this offensive to lure the Shivan juggernaut!"

1422, "(fr)Delta wing is standing by. Call in the bombers at your discretion, Alpha."

1423, "(fr)Sigma wing is now standing by. Deploy these bombers at your discretion."

1424, "(fr)All units! Return to base! The Shivan juggernaut is heading for the Gamma Draconis node!"

1425, "(fr)Alpha 1, you are disobeying a direct order! Command is withdrawing the fleet to Gamma Draconis. If you do not jump out now, you'll be left behind."

1426, "(fr)You'll pay for your insubordination, pilot. Allied Command, out."

1427, "(fr)A Flaming Sword"

1428, "(fr)As a last resort, the GTVA demolishes the Knossos subspace device in Gamma Draconis.
"

1429, "(fr)Sathanas

The Shivan juggernaut Sathanas is now en route to the jump node leading to Terran-Vasudan space. Command ordered all units to rally in Gamma Draconis in three hours' time. Though we have accounted for most of our fleet, at least six warships have failed to reach the rendezvous point. We can wait for them no longer.  The GTVA Security Council has authorized the immediate destruction of the Knossos subspace portal."

1430, "(fr)Meson Bomb

To demolish the Knossos portal, we will detonate the meson bomb, an experimental new weapon under development at the Hideki Institute in the Vega system. Though its specifications are highly classifed, physicists claim the meson bomb has more explosive power than any other warhead in our arsenal, sufficient to destroy any small craft within a three-kilometer radius. The size of the bomb prohibits tactical deployment."

1431, "(fr)Allied Strategy

A small task force will oversee the demolition of the Knossos while the bulk of the allied fleet blockades the jump node leading to the densely-populated Capella system. Command has begun the process of evacuating the two hundred fifty million civilians inhabiting Capella, the largest exodus since the Great War. The Colossus will remain in that system to engage the Sathanas should we fail."

1432, "(fr)At 2230 hours, the $f GTVA announced its plan for the destruction of the Knossos device. For strategic and scientific reasons, we will not attack the portal with the main guns of our warships. The demolition of the subspace portal will be accomplished with the use of the experimental Meson bomb."

1433, "(fr)Our first objective will be to sanitize the area. Observers report that Shivan scouting wings have already entered Gamma Draconis, and enemy activity will intensify before the arrival of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. The $f Renenet, a Sobek-class corvette, will monitor the operation and provide fire support."

1434, "(fr)Once we have eliminated the enemy presence, a freighter carrying the Meson warhead will deposit the bomb at the detonation site. This is the first deployment of the weapon prototype. Because computer simulations predict only a forty percent chance of success, we have two more warheads standing by."

1435, "(fr)We demolished the portal but to no avail.  The subspace vortex generated by the Knossos device has stabilized, and the Sathanas entered the Gamma Draconis system. Our forces are standing by to intercept the juggernaut at the Capella jump node.

We do not know how long the nebula jump node will remain open. In theory, it could be centuries before it collapses again. Scientists assure us that we have gathered sufficient data to reconstruct the Knossos, but a project of that magnitude would take decades to complete.
"

1436, "(fr)We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to avert this catastrophe."

1437, "(fr)Nevertheless, your tenacity is impressive. You eliminated all Shivan fighters. You are a credit to your species. Vasudan Tactical Command has taken note of your performance."

1438, "(fr)The destruction of the freighter was unacceptable, Terran. You have sufficient combat experience to understand that freighters and transports are vulnerable targets, and they require fighter support in hostile environments. In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1439, "(fr)It is not enough to attack targets of opportunity.  You must single out those that threaten your objectives and deal with them, either through direct action or by ordering your squadmates to do so."

1440, "(fr)We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board.  In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1447, "(fr)Protect the Renenet"

1448, "(fr)Command, this is the Renenet. We have detected 2 wings of Mara fighters 4000 meters from our position. The enemy has not engaged."

1449, "(fr)There's no time to wait. Alpha, close in and draw the fighters away from the Knossos. Lure them toward the Renenet. We need to clear that detonation site before we sortie the freighter. "

1450, "(fr)Acknowledged. We will lure them within range of the corvette's guns."

1451, "(fr)Command, we have engaged the enemy. We are now heading back to the Renenet."

1452, "(fr)Command, we achieved a clean detonation of the meson warhead. However, the Knossos portal remains fully operational. "

1453, "(fr)We will proceed with the second deployment. Demolition pattern sigma. We will use the remaining meson bombs for this attempt. The Sathanas juggernaut cannot be far away. "

1454, "(fr)The meson bombs have drawn the Shivans' attention. Defend the warheads until they are in position and the freighters have cleared the area."

1455, "(fr)This is Lambda 2. We are now in position."

1456, "(fr)Lambda 3 here. We have reached the detonation site."

1457, "(fr)Command, we have delivered the package, and we're moving out."

1458, "(fr)Undocking sequence complete. We are now returning to base."

1459, "(fr)Lambda 2 has cleared."

1460, "(fr)Lambda 2 is down! Repeat! Lambda 2 is down! All units, return to base. We must abort this mission."

1461, "(fr)We lost Lambda 2. Proceed with your objectives."

1462, "(fr)Lambda 3 has made the jump to subspace."

1463, "(fr)All units, return to base! We lost the meson warhead! Engage your jump drives now!"

1464, "(fr)Lambda 3 has been destroyed."

1465, "(fr)Command, this is Lambda 1. We are now in position. Initiating undocking sequence now."

1466, "(fr)Meson warhead armed and ready, Command. We're outta here."

1467, "(fr)Lambda 1 has cleared the blast zone. "

1468, "(fr)We've lost the warhead! We're pulling you out, Alpha. Return to base."

1469, "(fr)Lambda 1 has been annihilated. "

1470, "(fr)Command, we have sanitized the area. All hostiles have been eliminated."

1471, "(fr)It seems improbable a warhead would have sufficient force to demolish a structure of this size."

1472, "(fr)Particularly a weapon of Terran design."

1473, "(fr)The meson bomb is a joint development, Alpha 4. We are full partners in this enterprise."

1474, "(fr)Alpha wing, you would be well advised to concern yourself with the Shivans and leave these matters to the Security Council."

1475, "(fr)The Shivans have accepted your challenge, Alpha wing. Head back to the Renenet. Our turrets will open fire when the enemy comes within range."

1476, "(fr)Initiating detonation sequence. All units, stand clear of the blast zone."

1477, "(fr)Alpha, your vessel must be no less than 3,000 meters from the center of the portal."

1478, "(fr)Alpha, this is your final warning. We have no choice but to detonate."

1479, "(fr)Detonation in . . 5 . . 4 . . 3 . . 2 . . 1 . . Zero"

1480, "(fr)Incoming hostiles! Twelve dragon-class fighters have entered Gamma Draconis!"

1481, "(fr)All units, prepare for second detonation. You must be 3,000 meters from the warheads. This is your final warning."

1482, "(fr)Command, demolition pattern sigma has proven successful. The Knossos subspace portal has been destroyed."

1483, "(fr)Congratulations, Renenet. You just saved millions of lives out there. You'll get a hero's welcome back at the fleet. "

1484, "(fr)With all due respect, Command. This is no time for celebration. The destruction of this ancient artifact is an immeasurable loss. "

1485, "(fr)Our scientists have all the data we need to rebuild the portal in the future, Renenet. We just stopped the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1486, "(fr)Command, I'm picking up an incoming jump signature! The Sathanas is entering the system!"

1487, "(fr)That's impossible! Request immediate status update!"

1488, "(fr)The jump node between Gamma Draconis and the nebula has stabilized. Our destruction of the Knossos had no effect."

1489, "(fr)All units, return to base! We're pulling you out! Get out of there, pilots!"

1490, "(fr)Lambda 1 here. We have entered the field of engagement."

1491, "(fr)This is Lambda 2. We're in, Command. Setting course for the detonation site."

1492, "(fr)This is Lambda 3 on the scene. Proceeding to the drop point."

1493, "(fr)All probability for success has been nullified. Return to base, pilot. Mission aborted."

1494, "(fr)Bearbaiting"

1495, "(fr)Alpha wing of the 203rd must destroy the forward beam cannons of the Sathanas before it reaches the Capella jump node in Gamma Draconis"

1496, "(fr)The $h Sathanas decimated our fleet at the Capella node. Your bomber wing will be scrambled to destroy the Juggernaut's forward beam turrets before it reaches Capella. You must destroy at least two turrets to give the $h Colossus a fighting chance. You will be armed with the new long-range Trebuchet missile and the Helios torpedo, the $f GTVA's most powerful tactical warhead."

1497, "(fr)Your wing destroyed the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. The tactical significance of this achievement cannot be over-emphasized. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus. "

1498, "(fr)Your performance was outstanding."

1499, "(fr)Your wing destroyed three of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is superb. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1500, "(fr)Your performance was excellent."

1501, "(fr)Your wing destroyed two of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is adequate.  Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1502, "(fr)You have performed well. The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1503, "(fr)You destroyed only one of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons, pilot. You faced overwhelming odds, but they were not insurmountable. The Sathanas poses a dire threat, not only to the Colossus but to all systems of the GTVA. We are on the threshold of a second Shivan invasion, and we have limited resources to wage this war. "

1504, "(fr)The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1505, "(fr)You failed to destroy any of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons, pilot. You faced overwhelming odds, but they were not insurmountable. The Sathanas poses a dire threat, not only to the Colossus but to all systems of the GTVA. We are on the threshold of a second Shivan invasion, and we have limited resources to wage this war."

1506, "(fr)You also helped to eliminate the Beleth. Consequently, our remaining forces in Gamma Draconis are on the verge of securing the system.  "

1507, "(fr)The destroyer Thebes, however, did not survive the engagement. Our sacrifice in this battle is immeasurable. "

1508, "(fr)Regrettably, you were unable to stop the Beleth. However, neutralizing the Sathanas must remain our highest priority. "

1524, "(fr)You're halfway there, Alpha. Don't give up!"

1525, "(fr)One more turret to disable!"

1526, "(fr)Excellent. Continue with your attack, pilot. The more turrets we eliminate, the better our chances. Your work is done, so do not put yourself at unnecessary risk."

1527, "(fr)Impressive work, Alpha 1. The odds for the Colossus have improved dramatically."

1528, "(fr)We have lost the Phoenicia! Repeat! We have lost the Phoenicia!"

1529, "(fr)The Shivans wiped out Delta wing. It's all up to you, Alpha."

1530, "(fr)--Command, I will not jeopardize the lives of my crew! Either you deploy more ships now, or we will withdraw! We cannot hold this position without additional fleet assets!"

1531, "(fr)Alpha wing, your mission is to assist the Phoenicia. We must hold this node against the Shivan advance. Your objective--"

1532, "(fr)Alpha, your objective is to destroy the juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Target the tip of each of the four arms of the Sathanas. "

1533, "(fr)You must order the Phoenicia to withdraw, Command. The destroyer will not survive this engagement."

1534, "(fr)Neither will the Colossus if you fail your mission! You have your orders! Do it now!"

1535, "(fr)Delta wing, disable the forward flak guns or we'll be ripped to shreds. Alpha, focus on the main cannons."

1539, "(fr)This is the Thebes. We have emerged within a large debris field, Command. "

1540, "(fr)Alpha wing just resolved a tactical engagement, Thebes. Recon has sited a Demon-class destroyer, designation Beleth. The warship will be upon us momentarily."

1541, "(fr)Alpha and Gamma, you will be tasked with destroying the Demon's beam cannons. The Thebes will provide fire support. Reinforcements are standing by."

1542, "(fr)A Demon-class destroyer has jumped in. Command is well-informed."

1543, "(fr)Then they must know this mission is suicide."

1544, "(fr)Your performance was less than satisfactory, pilot. The Thebes will be in system momentarily to secure the node. Rearm and repair quickly. More enemy warships are inbound. Gamma wing deployed."

1545, "(fr)Excellent work, pilots. We have destroyed the Beleth. Secure the area and return to base. We need you in the Capella system."

1546, "(fr)Excellent work, pilots. Return to base pronto. We need you in the Capella system."

1547, "(fr)Good work."

1548, "(fr)Return to base, pilots. We need you to assist the Colossus in the Capella system."

1549, "(fr)The Phoenicia will hold back the Sathanas until you complete your objectives."

1550, "(fr)We have neutralized the first beam cannon!"

1551, "(fr)Good work. The Demon has only one beam turret operational."

1552, "(fr)We've destroyed the last of the main guns. Excellent job. Concentrate now on the anti-fighter beams and flak cannons."

1553, "(fr)The Sathanas is engaging its subspace drives. All units, get out of the way now!"

1554, "(fr)You failed this mission, pilot. The Sathanas will be at full strength when it confronts the Colossus. "

1555, "(fr)The Beleth has entered the Capella system! We have a massacre on our hands, pilot! Your incompetence has endangered millions of innocent lives! Return to base!"

1556, "(fr)The forward flak cannons are down. Good work."

1557, "(fr)The Beleth is engaging its jump drive! All units, stand clear!"

1558, "(fr)High Noon"

1559, "(fr)The Colossus and the Sathanas face off in the Capella system.
"

1560, "(fr)The $h Satahanas entered the Capella system and obliterated the line of defense we had established to intercept it. We now have no choice but to send in the $f Colossus. With its beam cannons still operational, the $h Sathanas has sufficient firepower to win this engagement.

Your wing will be scrambled immediately. There is no time to select your ship or armaments. Your mission is to neutralize these remaining beam cannons as quickly as possible. If you fail, we risk losing the $f Colossus and the Capella system. "

1561, "(fr)The $h Satahanas has entered the Capella system and engaged the $f Colossus. Your exceptional performance in Gamma Draconis has significantly improved the odds for the Alliance. We are deploying your wing to provide bomber support for the $f Colossus. Eliminate any target of opportunity, but do not take unnecessary risks."

1562, "(fr)With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. This operation could not have succeeded without your intervention, pilot. By neutralizing the forward beam cannons of the Sathanas, you gave the Colossus the advantage it required to win the battle.

For your outstanding record of service, you are hereby awarded the Nebula Campaign Victory Star. This medal recognizes your contributions to our mission of exploration and containment, from your first engagement in Gamma Draconis to our victory in the Capella system. Most notably, we commend you for three successful sorties against the Shivan Juggernaut Sathanas. Congratulations, Terran."

1563, "(fr)With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. The outcome of this operation would have been more favorable had you completed your objectives. Though the Colossus won the engagement, neutralizing the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons would have reduced the damage it sustained. "

1564, "(fr)The GTVA Colossus, the largest Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, over twenty years in the making, has been destroyed. Thirty thousand perished in the Juggernaut's attack, and millions more are in jeopardy. Though you neutralized the four beam cannons, you completed your objectives too late. "

1580, "(fr)The Sathanas is going down! All units, stand clear!"

1581, "(fr)Colossus, the Juggernaut has sustained only moderate damage. You need to direct more energy through your main guns!"

1582, "(fr)We're having difficulty stabilizing the power grid, Command. Shutting down non-essential systems."

1583, "(fr)More firepower, Colossus! The hull integrity of the Sathanas has fallen below fifty percent. "

1584, "(fr)Heat sinks were not made for this kind of abuse, Command! We'll melt down our cannons if we push any harder."

1585, "(fr)We're almost there, Colossus! Target has gone critical! The war must end here and now!"

1586, "(fr)Secondary and Tertiary reactors are down! Fire control is on the verge of redline! We're giving it all we got!"

1587, "(fr)One cannon left! We are running out of time, Alpha! "

1588, "(fr)All cannons are down! Repeat! All cannons are down!  Eliminate targets of opportunity, but be careful. It's all up to the Colossus now."

1589, "(fr)You completed your mission too late, pilot. The battle has been lost.  Return to base."

1591, "(fr)We have eliminated Cancer wing."

1592, "(fr)Return to Babel"

1593, "(fr)The 203rd must capture the NTF Iceni, Admiral Bosch's command ship.
"

1594, "(fr)Colossus Triumphant

At 0345 hours, the GTVA Colossus destroyed the Shivan juggernaut Sathanas near the Gamma Draconis jump node in Capella. This victory proves without a doubt our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. For the second time, the Alliance defeated a species which has annihilated entire civilizations across this galaxy. 

With the Colossus, we will have nothing more to fear."

1595, "(fr)Damage Control

We still have much to accomplish, however. The Sathanas inflicted moderate damage against the Colossus, though its systems remain 80% operational. Terran and Vasudan engineers anticipate it will take several months to fully repair the warship's hull. Until we completely secure the nebula, our evacuation of Capella's civilian population will proceed as planned."

1596, "(fr)Chasing the Iceni

With the immediate Shivan threat neutralized, we must now focus on capturing Admiral Bosch. Recon units are scouring the nebula for any sign of his command ship. The Psamtik will lead a task force assigned to recover the Iceni once its position has been determined.

Command has disclosed new information concerning the NTF's secret agenda."

1597, "(fr)ETAK

We now know that Admiral Bosch has developed a Shivan communication technology that transmits and modulates quantum pulses. Bosch secretly resurrected a defunct GTI project involving captured Shivan specimen, terminated after the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. Bosch referred to his project as ETAK, short for Etamnanki, the tower that may have inspired the story of Babel."

1598, "(fr)Stealing History

Through a rigorous study of Ancient archeology, Bosch learned the location of the Knossos subspace device, the portal to the region of the galaxy where the Ancients first encountered the Shivans. His genocidal war was a smoke screen to cover his plunder of Ancient sites in Vasudan systems. In Deneb, he learned how to activate the portal and deployed the Trinity to power up the device."

1599, "(fr)An Infernal Pact

Integral to Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra was an alliance with the Shivans upon their return to our systems. When Bosch realized his regime was on the brink of collapse, he ordered his forces into the nebula to make contact with the enemy. Interrogation of rebel prisoners reveals that only Bosch's immediate subordinates had access to the ETAK project. No further details are available at your level of clearance."

1600, "(fr)Circe

You are now authorized to use the GTW-19 Circe. Derived from advanced EM weaponry, the Circe disrupts shield systems by directing a barrage of fluctuating EM harmonics on the target. This energy is completely ineffective against armor plating or insulated subsystems. For this reason, the Circe is best paired with a weapon such as the Maxim or the Prometheus, which inflict heavy hull damage."

1601, "(fr)Reconnaissance has located the NTF Iceni. Bosch has made contact with the Shivans a second time. An Azrael-class transport is currently docked with the vessel. A second transport appears to be waiting nearby. We do not know if the Shivans are boarding the Iceni, or if Bosch and his followers are boarding the transports."

1602, "(fr)Our objective is to capture the $h Iceni and the ETAK technology. Two Shivan cruisers are guarding the vessel, the $h Azmedaj and the $h Sammael. Once the cruisers have been destroyed, we will deploy a Special Forces unit to board and secure the rebel command ship. Your second objective will be to defend our transport, the $f GVT $f Qeb."

1603, "(fr)To our knowledge, the $h Iceni holds the only example of the ETAK technology in existence. Bosch took extraordinary measures to destroy all evidence of his research. If we fail, we have little hope of rebuilding the device. Command has absolute faith in your ability to succeed in this endeavor."

1604, "(fr)Our transport failed to dock with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and we lost the communication technology. All evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1605, "(fr)Use your squadmates to cover multiple objectives."

1606, "(fr)The GVT Qeb rescued the survivors of the Iceni and retrieved the specifications for Bosch's ETAK device. 

Command has classified these materials Level Omega, accessible only by persons specially authorized by the GTVA Security Council. Be advised that divulging any information regarding this operation is punishable under the GTVA Security Act, Antares Convention, Section 15-5-7.

We arrived too late to stop the Azrael transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his immediate subordinates. Our questioning of the survivors reveals the encounter had been violent. The motives of the Shivans cannot be determined, though it seems Bosch's experiment attracted their attention. Reconnaissance is now searching for the Shivan transport.

Against overwhelming odds, you destroyed the Shivan cruisers, protected the Iceni, and escorted the transport safely home. It is indeed an honor to serve with a pilot of your caliber."

1607, "(fr)The Shivans destroyed the GVT Qeb while the transport was still docked with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1608, "(fr)We were almost there, pilot. Our transport was mere seconds away from jumping to safety. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed.

1649, "(fr)I'm telling you there's no time, Command! Get us out of here now!"

1650, "(fr)Hull integrity has fallen below critical! We're gonna die out here, Command! Get us some fighter cover!"

1653, "(fr)Transmit the specs, Lieutenant. This is your last chance to redeem yourself."

1654, "(fr)Sorry, Command. We're taking that secret to hell with us. Believe me. You don't want to know. Rusk out."

1655, "(fr)The Azrael has undocked with the Iceni. The vessel is preparing to engage its subspace drive."

1658, "(fr)The 203rd pursues the Shivan Azrael transport to an uncharted region of the nebula."

1659, "(fr)At 1640 hours, reconnaissance detected the Shivan transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his subordinates deep within a Shivan-controlled zone of the nebula. A wing of $h Maras repelled our recon unit, but we now have an approximate location. Alpha and Beta, your mission is to find and disable the $h Azrael transport."

1660, "(fr)The attack must be executed quickly, before the transport escapes. Once its engines are disabled, defend the transport until the recovery team arrives on $f Lambda $f 1. They will dock with the $h Azrael and haul the vessel back to Gamma Draconis. $f Lambda $f 2 will be standing by in case $f Lambda $f 1 should fail."

1661, "(fr)Capturing Bosch and his lieutenants is of the utmost importance. We do not know if they are alive or dead, or what the Shivans intend to do with them."

1662, "(fr)Welcome to the GVD Memphis, Terran. The annihilation of the Psamtik and the thousands on board is a tragedy for all Vasudans. A people birthed in sorrow will die in sorrow, as the old proverb goes. The discovery of the second Knossos portal was of extraordinary significance, but there will be no expedition.

Allied forces have sighted multiple Sathanas-class juggernauts converging on our positions throughout the nebular theater. We stand on the brink of a new Shivan resurgence, and our systems are once again in jeopardy. 

For the second time, Command has ordered a full retreat of all allied vessels from the nebula. We will withdraw immediately to the Capella system, where we will mount our defense. However, not even the Colossus has the firepower to repel a juggernaut fleet.

With the disappearance of the Azrael, and the extreme secrecy surrounding the Alliance's handling of the ETAK project, it could be many years before we learn what happened out here."

1674, "(fr)Maintain your current heading. Recon tracked the Azrael to that position. It must be somewhere nearby."

1675, "(fr)Command, we have encountered a second subspace portal!"

1676, "(fr)Say again, pilot? Another subspace portal?"

1677, "(fr)Affirmative. The device has been activated."

1678, "(fr)Can you locate the Azrael?"

1686, "(fr)9,000 meters? You're way off course, Psamtik! What happened?"

1687, "(fr)The subspace field generated by the portal appears to have interfered with our transit."

1688, "(fr)Pilots, head directly for the Psamtik. We need time to get the ship into position."

1689, "(fr)The Psamtik will spearhead our exploration of the region beyond the portal. You will escort the Psamtik until we deploy our expeditionary force."

1690, "(fr)All units, defend the Psamtik! Do not allow the Shivan attack to build momentum!"

1692, "(fr)Affirmative! Sathanas configuration! Repeat! Sathanas configuration!"

1693, "(fr)That's impossible, Psamtik!"

1695, "(fr)Psamtik, get out of there! Now! We're pulling you out!"

1696, "(fr)Jump drive inoperative! All systems compromised! Catastrophic hull failure imminent!"

1697, "(fr)Psamtik, do you copy? Come in, Psamtik! This is Allied Command! Do you read me?"

1698, "(fr)Pilots, you will jump to the GVD Memphis. Your nav computer has the coordiantes. Return to base!"

1699, "(fr)Jump out immediately, pilot. We are in full retreat. Allied Command, out."

"

1703, "(fr)At 3320 Vasudan Galactic Time, we received a distress signal from the $f GTD $f Aquitaine. The destroyer came under attack 4,000 meters from the Gamma Draconis jump node. The $h SC $h Urobach and its fighter escort incapacitated the $f Aquitaine's engines and fighterbay."

1704, "(fr)Admiral Petrarch reports that his gunners destroyed the $h Urobach and all but one of the fighter wings. With the entire Shivan armada now heading for Terran-Vasudan space, we must get the $f Aquitaine out as soon as possible. Your mission is to defend the $f Aquitaine until its propulsion systems are restored."

1705, "(fr)A damage control team is currently en route from Gamma Draconis. The $f GTC $f Agrippa, an Aeolus-class warship, escorts the $f Argo transport carrying the team and the components needed for the repair. When the $f Argo arrives, your objective will be to ensure it docks safely with the damaged destroyer."

1706, "(fr)The $f Aquitaine's Engineering Officer estimates that once the damage control team arrives with the required materials, the repair will be accomplished in a matter of minutes. However, this provides the Shivans sufficient time to launch additional wings and threaten the $f Aquitaine."

1707, "(fr)With sorrow, we remember the 10,000 officers and crew of the GTD Aquitaine. They fought courageously and died with valor. 

Your next assignment would have been on board the Aquitaine, leading the 70th Blue Lions squadron. However, with these recent developments, you have been reassigned to fly support for the 12th Fleet in the remote Wolf 359 system. 

Your transport departs at 0150."

1708, "(fr)Stay close to the Aquitaine. Use its defenses to your advantage."

1709, "(fr)Because of your actions, the GTD Aquitaine safely reached the Gamma Draconis system. The damage to the vessel's fighterbay and targeting system is now being repaired. 

Vasudan Tactical Command has informed us you are to be transferred immediately to the GTD Aquitaine for your next assignment. You will serve as leader of the elite 70th Blue Lions. However, you have also received an urgent transmission from Special Operations Command. Your talents are in demand, pilot. 

For your exceptional service to the crown of Emperor Khonsu II, Heir of the Dynasty of Ten Thousand Years, you are hereby inducted into the Imperial Order of Vasuda. Rarely is this honor conferred upon those of your species. Congratulations, Terran."

1739, "(fr)Aquitaine here. Initiating jump drive sequence. See you in Gamma Draconis, Alpha. Thanks for your help."

1740, "(fr)Well done, Alpha. Return to base."

1741, "(fr)This is the Aquitaine. Hull integrity has fallen below critical! We need more fighters out here, or we're not going to make it, Command!"

1742, "(fr)We have lost the Aquitaine! All units return to base! Mission aborted!"

1743, "(fr)We have deployed reinforcements, Alpha. Stand by."

1749, "(fr)70th Blue Lions

Welcome back to the Aquitaine. Because of your outstanding service to the Alliance, the GTVA has granted you command of your own elite fighter squadron, the 70th Blue Lions. This is quite an honor, pilot. You'll receive all your briefings directly from quarterdeck. 

As squadron leader of the Blue Lions, you will be granted the highest priority in ship and weapon selection, but choose your ordnance carefully. Review the techroom database if you have any questions."

1750, "(fr)The Shivan Armada

Nine Sathanas juggernauts have now entered the Capella system, and Intelligence has sighted even more in the nebula, converging on the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. 

We are on the threshold of a new apocalypse. Though the juggernauts have not engaged our warships, they have set course for the Capella star. We can only speculate about their intentions, but this development cannot bode well for the Alliance."

1751, "(fr)Exodus

Allied Command is committed to evacuating all non-essential personnel. A contingency plan is in the works to hold the Shivans here, in Capella, and prevent the expansion of the Shivan incursion to other systems of the GTVA. 

The 70th Blue Lions will provide the fighter cover needed to get our convoys out of the system. Millions of lives are at stake here, pilot. And if we fail, all our worlds and systems will be in jeopardy."

1752, "(fr)Erinyes Fighter

The GTVA has just unveiled the newly developed Erinyes-class heavy assault fighter. With eight gun banks, you'll have sufficient firepower to make short work of enemy targets at close range.  The Erinyes can accommodate fire control for up to two different primary systems. 

You may need to allocate more power to weapons to fight effectively, so make adjustments as needed."

1753, "(fr)GTW UD-8 Kayser

You have also been issued the GTW UD-08 Kayser. For its limited OpEval period, only select units will be authorized to carry this weapon. The Kayser emits focused wavelets of subatomic particles that bombard the target, causing the wave function of the particles to collapse and emit intense zero-point energy microbursts. The Kayser is the product of our research into Shivan weapon technology."

1754, "(fr)GTM-11 Infyrno

Finally, we have received the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. To use the Infyrno, press your secondary trigger once to launch the missile, then press it again to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the distance of the warhead from your ship.  Upon detonation, the Infyrno releases multiple submunitions which themselves contain ultra-high explosive charges."

1755, "(fr)As we speak, convoys of transports, freighters, and medical ships are heading for the jump nodes to Vega and Epsilon Pegasi. The evacuation of civilian personnel proceeds on schedule, but the enemy offensive has intensified. We have blockaded the Gamma Draconis node, though Shivan forces are swarming into the system."

1756, "(fr)The 53rd will relieve the 309th at the Gamma Draconis node, and we'll deploy the 19th to hold down the fort at 3rd Fleet Headquarters as we evacuate non-essential personnel. Command needs a closer look at the Juggernauts, so we'll be sending in the 91st.  70th Blue Lions will be sortied to the Epsilon Pegasi node."

1757, "(fr)Blue Lions, your mission is to escort a four-ship convoy to Epsilon Pegasi. The group consists of civilian transports $f Lambda $f 1 and $f 2, $f GTFr $f Sulla, and the medical ship $f GTM $f Vesalius. All have minimal armaments and vulnerable hull plating. $f GVCv $f Nebtuu leads the escort."

1758, "(fr)At 1415 hours, the Shivan corvette $h Abraxis and a wing of $h Manticore fighters attacked the convoy. The $f Nebtuu called for assistance, so you're going in. Theta wing will stand by to reinforce your position. Call them in at your discretion. Good luck, pilots. The people of Capella are counting on you."

1759, "(fr)Do not jump out until ordered to do so. You should not be making this mistake at this stage of your career."

1760, "(fr)Excellent work, pilot. Your first sortie as leader of the 70th Blue Lions proved you are just the officer to lead this outfit. The Shivans launched a savage attack, but you and your squadron held them off. Because of your tactical leadership, the entire convoy safely reached Epsilon Pegasi. 
"

1761, "(fr)The Shivans launched a massive offensive against all our outbound convoys. The death toll has escalated into the hundred of thousands. We do not have the resources to defend every ship escaping this system. Even your elite 70th Blue Lions failed to complete all mission objectives."

1762, "(fr)Both Lambda transports perished in the Shivan attack. Thousands of civilians were lost."

1763, "(fr)Both Lambda transports reached Epsilon Pegasi. Your efforts saved thousands of lives. "

1764, "(fr)One of the Lambda transports reached the jump node. Half the civilians perished in the Shivan attack."

1765, "(fr)Relief workers in Vega and Epsilon Pegasi report a shortage of vital provisions and medical supplies. The loss of the Sulla will only complicate matters."

1766, "(fr)We managed to save the GTFr Sulla. The provisions it carried will help alleviate the supply shortages in Epsilon Pegasi."

1767, "(fr)The destruction of the GTM Vesalius is a tragedy. With the casualties the Shivans have inflicted in Capella, every medical vessel is vital to our efforts."

1768, "(fr)The GTM Vesalius arrived in Epsilon Pegasi. The medical vessel will play a crucial role in handling the influx of refugees from Capella."

1769, "(fr)Your squadron eliminated all hostile targets. If we are to halt the Shivan advance, every effort must be made to diminish the enemy force."

1770, "(fr)We need to deploy your unit to 3rd Fleet Headquarters pronto. Assemble your squadron in the ready room."

1794, "(fr)Lambda 1 here. Hull has sustained heavy damage. Requesting fighter protection."

1795, "(fr)This is Lambda 1. Hull integrity now below critical! Hundreds will die if you don't get us out of here!"

1803, "(fr)We've lost Lambda 2! They're slaughtering us out there!"

1804, "(fr)Lambda 1! Come in, Lambda 1! We've lost your signal! "

1805, "(fr)The GTM Vesalius has been destroyed. All personnel on board were lost."

1806, "(fr)Alpha, the Nebtuu is gone. All allied warships are currently engaged. You're on your own out there."

1807, "(fr)The Shivans wiped out our entire convoy. Return to base, Alpha."

1808, "(fr)The Sulla has engaged its jump drives and is now en route for Epsilon Pegasi."

1809, "(fr)The civilians are now all accounted for. 50% survived the engagement. "

1814, "(fr)The 70th Blue Lions assist with the evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters in Capella."

1815, "(fr)At 2345 hours, Allied Command authorized the immediate evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters in the Capella system. The installation has come under heavy fighter and bomber attack. The Shivans are deploying their wings from the $h SD $h Nebiros, a Ravana-class destroyer. The 19th squadron, assigned to defend headquarters, has been wiped out."

1816, "(fr)The evacuation will proceed as follows. $f Lambda $f 1, an Argo-class transport, will dock with the installation. Personnel will then board the Argo, which will take them to the $f GTD $f Messana. Command will deploy a second transport to extract the remaining personnel on board the installation. The injured have already been transferred to the medical vessel $f GTM $f Galen."

1817, "(fr)After $f Lambda $f 2 has docked with the $f Orion, the $f Messana will leave the system, and you will be authorized to return to base. You will take Alpha and Delta wings and provide fighter cover for this operation. You must protect the installation, the $f Messana, and the two transports. Once evacuated, the installation will be destroyed."

1818, "(fr)We have already extracted non-essential personnel, so the operation should proceed quickly. With the evacuation of Headquarters, the Alliance is preparing to initiate the final phase of its plan to hold the Shivans in Capella."

1819, "(fr)Outstanding work, pilot. Both Lambda transports safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was a complete success. Under your capable leadership, the 70th Blue Lions upholds its standing among the elite squadrons of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance.

The GTVA Security Council has revealed its strategy for holding the Shivans in the Capella system. I will address the officers and crew of the Aquitaine in one hour. The 70th Blue Lions will play a critical role in the upcoming operation. I know that you and your squadron are up to the challenge."

1820, "(fr)Though we lost the first transport, Lambda 2 safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was only a partial success. Under the circumstances, this outcome is perhaps the best we could hope for. However, may I remind you that elite squadrons earn their status by going above and beyond the call of duty.

1824, "(fr)The loss of the GTD Messana is a tragedy. Many friends and colleagues perished today, and we are left only to ask what could we have done to save them. As Commanding Officer of the Aquitaine, I placed my faith in you and your squadron. The 70th Blue Lions have earned a reputation as one of the finest units in the GTVA. But reputations do not save lives. Reputations do not achieve results. I have no choice but to relieve you of your command. You are dismissed, pilot."

1867, "(fr)Their Finest Hour"

1868, "(fr)The 70th Blue Lions participate in a feint at the Gamma Draconis jump node.
"

1869, "(fr)Exodus

With over one hundred thousand casualties and more Shivans incoming, we have no hope of holding Capella. Our only real chance is to seal off the system and prevent the invasion from spreading to other Terran-Vasudan worlds. If we fail to contain the Shivan advance, we will unleash the second Great War, a conflict we have virtually no chance of surviving. The Lucifer fleet we defeated 32 years ago is nothing compared to the strength of this armada. Command is committed to getting every last Terran out of the system."

1870, "(fr)A Subspace Anomaly

Over 80 Shivan Juggernauts are now in position around the Capella sun. Science vessels monitoring their activity have detected an anomalous subspace field rippling from the Juggernaut fleet. Though we can barely detect the field with our instruments, its intensity has been increasing slowly over the past seventy-two hours. We have known since the Great War that the Shivans possess advanced subspace technologies, but this field goes beyond our wildest speculations. The Shivans may be powering up a new kind of weapon, the likes of which we have never before encountered."

1871, "(fr)Sacrifice

Preparations are now underway to collapse the Epsilon Pegasi jump node. A Great-War-era destroyer, the GTD Bastion, will contain multiple meson warheads that will detonate inside the node. Scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse, as evidenced by the destruction of the Lucifer 32 years ago. The detonation of the Lucifer's reactors sealed off the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis and severed all contact with Earth. The Bastion has completed its modifications in the Vega system and is now entering Capella."

1872, "(fr)Will the Strategy Work?

Skeptics have argued the Shivans made intersystem jumps without using nodes in Ross 128, Ikeya, Vega, and other systems at the outbreak of the Great War. However, scientists assure us this plan will work. Though Shivans have used uncharted nodes and nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels, they are as dependent on jump nodes as we are. Nevertheless, we must accept this strategy as nothing more than a temporary measure."

1873, "(fr)Endgame

Once we have evacuated all civilian and military personnel from the Capella system, we will send a second destroyer, also carrying meson warheads, through the Capella jump node in Vega. If we succeed in sealing off both nodes, the Alliance will have trapped the Shivans in this system. If we fail, we face certain annihilation. 

This is our Alamo, pilots. We hold them here, or we die trying."

1874, "(fr)The $f GTD $f Bastion will enter the Capella system at 1835 hours. We're sending in the 116th to escort the warship into position. Our forward observer units near the Juggernauts are calling for backup, so we'll send in the 83rd. The 309th will assist with the containment effort at the Vega node, and as for the 70th Blue Lions, we've got something special for you."

1875, "(fr)Your mission is to create a diversion at the Gamma Draconis node. The operation here will be a feint to lure the Shivan armada. The $f Colossus and its group will form a battle line near the node. By focusing our firepower here, we'll draw the brunt of the Shivan offensive. Meanwhile, on the other side of the system, the $f Bastion will collapse the node to Epsilon Pegasi."

1876, "(fr)Your objectives are simple. Destroy all enemy targets. Be advised reinforcements will not be readily available. In a recent engagement, the $f Colossus sustained damage to its fighterbays. You'll have to hold out until they get the flight deck cleared. Good luck, pilot."

1877, "(fr)The Colossus has been destroyed. Over thirty thousand officers and crew, our colleagues, compatriots, and friends, perished in this battle. The most powerful Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, twenty years in the making, was vaporized in a matter of minutes.

Command acknowledges there was nothing you could have done to save the Colossus. Many of your squadmates were killed, and you are lucky to have survived the engagement. However, we have no time to mourn the dead. We have a job to do, and if we fail, millions more will suffer and die.

The 70th Blue Lions are being scrambled to assist the Bastion. Report to the ready room on the double."

The $f Bastion will be detonated inside the node to create a subspace cataclysm that will seal off the Capella system. If the $f Bastion fails to achieve this objective, the Shivans will swarm into our adjacent systems."

1912, "(fr)The task force defending the $f Bastion has been decimated. Three ships remain: the $f Templar, the $f Malta, and the $f Ertanax. All are Aeolus-class cruisers. The Shivans continue to send wave after wave of fighters and bombers. Only a handful of the $f Bastion's original fighter complement have survived the onslaught."

1913, "(fr)Alpha, Delta, and Beta wings will fly heavy intercept. Your mission is to take out enemy bombers before they close within targeting distance. You'll be armed with the Trebuchet missile, which has an effective range of four kilometers. Gamma wing will fly the Perseus. Their role will be to engage enemy fighters. "

1914, "(fr)The majority of the fleet is fending off a massive attack at the Vega node. Thousands of civilians await evacuation and the enemy continues to flood in from Gamma Draconis. We will not get a second chance to pull this off. If we fail here, we unleash the Second Shivan War. We must get the $f Bastion through at any cost."

1944, "(fr)Excellent work. The detonation of the $f Bastion's Meson bombs created a subspace cataclysm that sealed off the node. You and the 70th Blue Lions deserve the highest commendation.

The Security Council has authorized the deployment of the $f GTD $f Nereid. The destroyer will depart from the Vega system and collapse the node in fifteen minutes. We must therefore complete our evacuation of Capella by that time. Any ship that remains behind will be trapped with the Shivan armada.

Your objective is to defend our convoys as they flee through the Vega node. Cargo ships, personnel transports, medical vessels, and the remnants of the allied fleet are now in transit. These convoys are under heavy bomber fire. If we don't provide cover, thousands will die. 

Your secondary objective is to prevent Shivan warships from entering the Vega node. The Allied fleet has been pulverized, so for the sake of all Terrans and Vasudans, the war must end here. You will receive authorization to enter the Vega node and leave the system once the $f Nereid has been deployed."

The $h Tanis and the freighters are now in the Aldebaran system. Command anticipates the rebels will try to transfer the hostages to the destroyer."

2045, "(fr)Your main task is to keep those freighters from docking with the $h Tanis.  We need to get the hostages back and we won't be able to if they get them onto that destroyer. If you can prevent that rendezvous, we'll send in marines in troop transports to capture the freighters and rescue the hostages."

2046, "(fr)Do whatever is necessary to ensure the hostages' safety. We don't know what other forces the $h HoL has in-system, but you must handle them. Once the hostages are out of danger, wipe out the remaining $h HoL vessels."

2117, "(fr)The 53rd Hammerheads

Welcome to Vega, Ensign. I am Lieutenant Loukakis, squadron leader of the 53rd Hammerheads. You have been assigned to our unit. The Hammerheads are a space superiority squadron. We'll be flying the Myrmidon fighter, developed to replace the old GTF Ulysses. The Myrmidon is a Terran-Vasudan design and a versatile ship with high marks for speed, maneuverability, armor, and loadout."

2118, "(fr)History of the 53rd

The 53rd Hammerheads were formed during the Great War. At the time, we served on board the GTD Bastion, the finest ship in the history of Terran space travel. You may not know this, but the pilots who destroyed the SD Lucifer in 2335 were based on the Bastion, and some were even Hammerheads. With the 53rd, you're part of a long and proud tradition."

2119, "(fr)Our New Home

When the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the jump node to the Sol system and severed all contact with Earth, Command transferred the Bastion to the 4th Fleet in Vega. Since then we've called Vega our home. Now Command has de-commissioned the Bastion and reassigned its squadrons to the newer Hecate destroyers. We'll be joining the GTD Aquitaine, flagship of the 3rd Fleet, Capella."

2120, "(fr)Review Your Training

The Aquitaine will be here in 36 hours. In the meantime, it would be advisable to review your training. We have all the simulator modules you'll need for the Myrmidon fighter. These modules will give you a refresher course on such basics as your Head-Up Display (HUD), throttle controls, and targeting. If you need to review your training, now would be a good time to do so."

2121, "(fr)Armaments

Because this is your first combat assignment, you'll be authorized to carry the standard armaments: the Subach HL-7, the Tempest dumb-fire, and the Rockeye heat-seeking missile. These weapons are covered in the training modules and in the tech room database. As you gain experience in combat, you will be authorized to use more advanced weaponry.

Good luck, pilot. And welcome again to the 53rd."

2122, "(fr)Welcome to training simulator module TSM-103c, Class C qualification for the Myrmidon space superiority fighter. This module has been designed to acquaint pilots with basic targeting, throttle, and weapons systems."

2209, "(fr)In combat, you will need to acquire your targets quickly. With multiple wings and warships, you will not have time to cycle through all objects in sensor range to find a specific target. Let's take a look at some controls that will help you locate targets more efficiently."

2210, "(fr)Two drones will be used for the first part of this exercise."

2211, "(fr)You have a targeting control which enables you to acquire the nearest hostile target [$h$]. Using the control repeatedly will cycle through hostile targets in order of their proximity."

2213, "(fr)Good. Now Target Drone 02. [Press $h$]"

2214, "(fr)Excellent."

2215, "(fr)Now we'll learn another useful targeting control. As a GTVA fighter pilot, you will be called upon to defend larger vessels, from troop transports to destroyer-class warships. For this simulation, let's bring in a Triton-class freighter."

2216, "(fr)Observe that the name and hull integrity of the freighter appears in a box to the right of your reticle. This escort list enables you to monitor its status."

2217, "(fr)You can target ships on your escort list by using the escort targeting control. Target the freighter now. [Press $e$]"

2218, "(fr)Well done. On any escort mission, it is important that you stay close to vessels you have been assigned to protect. The escort targeting control makes locating these ships more efficient."

2219, "(fr)Be advised the escort list will not be limited to ships you have been ordered to protect. Any major target, friendly or hostile, could appear on that list. This will help you monitor the status of ships with tactical or strategic importance."

2220, "(fr)Let's review what we've covered so far."

2221, "(fr)Now Target Drone 02. [Press $h$]"

2222, "(fr)Now target the freighter with your escort targeting control. [Press $e$]"

2223, "(fr)Well done."

2224, "(fr)In module TSM-103c, you practiced firing your HL-7. We'll now take a closer look at your primary and secondary weapons."

2225, "(fr)Your weapons loadout is displayed to the right of your reticle. Primary cannons are listed above your secondary missile banks."

2226, "(fr)Use your primary weapon selector [Press $.$] to toggle either one or both cannons to fire. Firing both primaries will inflict more damage but will also drain more energy from your fighter's reserves."

2227, "(fr)The Myrmidon space superiority fighter has three missile banks. As a new pilot, you will be authorized to use the Tempest dumbfire and the Rockeye heat-seeker. Let's practice firing the Tempest."

2228, "(fr)Use your secondary weapon selector [Press $/$] to arm your bank of Tempest missiles."

2229, "(fr)Good. Tempests are dumb-fire projectiles. These warheads have no homing system, so they'll fly in the direction in which they are fired. For this reason, they are most effective at close range. Unless your aim is very precise, hitting targets at a distance with the Tempest may be difficult."

2230, "(fr)Now select Drone 01 using your hostile targeting control. [Press $h$]"

2231, "(fr)Good. Destroy Drone 01 with your Tempest missiles. [Press $spacebar$] Close your distance if you need to."

2232, "(fr)Well done. The Tempest may not be as accurate as a heat- or aspect-seeking missile, but a Myrmidon can carry up to 320 of these missiles. A volley of Tempests will quickly pulverize an enemy fighter."

2233, "(fr)To maximize their effectiveness, use them in conjunction with your Subach HL-7. While the lasers penetrate the shields of your target, the missiles will impact the enemy's hull."

2234, "(fr)Let's move on to the Rockeye heat-seeker. Arm the Rockeye with your secondary weapon selector. [Press $/$]"

2235, "(fr)Well done. Now target Drone 02. [Press $h$]"

2236, "(fr)When you fire the Rockeye, the missile's tracking system will lock onto the heat signature of your target. Be aware the homing radius of the Rockeye is limited, and your target must be near the center of your HUD."

2237, "(fr)Destroy Drone 02 using your Rockeye missiles. [Press $spacebar$]"

2238, "(fr)Nice shooting, pilot. Compared to the Tempest, the Rockeye is more accurate and has a greater effective range. However, the Myrmidon can carry no more than 20 Rockeyes."

2239, "(fr)You can also toggle double-fire mode to launch twice the ordnance. [Press $Shift-/$] You will inflict more damage and increase your chances of hitting the target, but your missiles will be depleted more rapidly in double-fire mode."

2240, "(fr)We will now send in more drones so you can practice firing missiles. Be sure to toggle between banks so you can get a feel for both the Tempest and the Rockeye."

2241, "(fr)When you run low on missiles, you need to rearm your fighter. To do this you must call in a support ship."

2242, "(fr)First, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key to Rearm."

2243, "(fr)In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your fighter to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you."

2244, "(fr)In the lower portion of your HUD, an indicator displays the support ship's ETA."

2245, "(fr)The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your secondary weapons and countermeasures."

2246, "(fr)Second, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to your ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem.  However, the support ship cannot repair your hull."

2247, "(fr)Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to completely rearm your fighter."

2248, "(fr)We covered a lot in this module. If you need to review this material, replay the simulation. Otherwise, you are qualified to proceed to TSM-103a. Engage your subspace drive."

2281, "(fr)You'll notice as I move, a circular indicator moves in front of my ship.  That is the lead indicator.  It shows you where you need to fire your primary weapon to hit your target."

2282, "(fr)Now target the drone. You can use your basic targeting control [Press $t$] or your hostile targeting control. [Press $h$]"

2283, "(fr)The target box in the lower left-hand corner of the HUD displays the distance to and hull integrity of your target."

2284, "(fr)Your target's hull strength is also shown in the lower part of your reticle."

2285, "(fr)As I shoot the drone, watch its hull integrity drop slowly."

2286, "(fr)A good dogfighting tactic is matching speeds with your target.  I want you to match speeds with the drone.  [Press $M$]"

2287, "(fr)Good. Your throttle can be set to automatically match the speed of your target, even as your targets change. Use your auto matching control to toggle this feature on or off. [Press $alt-m$]"

2288, "(fr)Good. You should be on the move at all times during a dogfight."

2289, "(fr)Now destroy the drone."

2290, "(fr)Don't forget you also have missiles.  [Press $spacebar$]"

2291, "(fr)Two new unarmed drones have arrived.  Destroy both of them.  Remember to match their speed.  [Press $m$]"

2292, "(fr)An easy way to target new hostiles is by using auto targeting.  [Press $alt-h$]  This will automatically target your nearest hostile after your current target has either left the area or has been destroyed."

2293, "(fr)This drone is armed.  It will start firing upon you in 10 seconds.  Destroy it."

2294, "(fr)You're sustaining a lot of damage from that drone. You may need to review the first two training modules."

2295, "(fr)Let's try this exercise again.  Here come two more unarmed drones.  Destroy them."

2296, "(fr)Here is an armed drone.  You have 10 seconds before it opens fire.  Destroy it."

2297, "(fr)Pilot, you are by no means ready for combat.  Engage your jump drive to end this simulation.  [Press $alt-j$]"

2298, "(fr)Now comes the fun part.  Five pairs of armed drones will jump in.  Destroy as many as you can."

2299, "(fr)Looks like you've had enough.  Engage your jump drive to end this simulation.  [Press $alt-j$]"

2300, "(fr)You did not follow instructions, pilot. You have failed this training simulation. Engage your jump drive.  [Press $alt-j$]"

2301, "(fr)Great job, pilot.  You have successfully qualified on the Myrmidon space superiority fighter.  Engage your subspace drive.  [Press $alt-j$]"

2302, "(fr)You have successfully qualified on the Myrmidon space superiority fighter. Engage your jump drive.  [Press $alt-j$]"

2303, "(fr)Training 4"

2304, "(fr)Put mission description here
"

2305, "(fr)Welcome to the Squadron

Welcome to the 107th Ravens, pilot. I'm Lieutenant Samsa, squadron leader.  As you know, the Aquitaine is now en route to the Gamma Draconis system. The details of the situation there have been classified at the highest level, so I'm as much in the dark as you are. The Admiral will brief the crew when we reach 3rd Fleet headquarters in Capella."

2306, "(fr)The 107th Ravens

The 107th is a heavy assault squadron, so our fighter of choice is the Hercules Mark II. Implementing advances in fusion drive technology, the Mark II improves the assault fighter's speed and maneuverability without sacrificing loadout. The Herc has only two missile banks, but its ordnance capacity is greater than the Myrmidon's. The original Herc won the Great War, so we're proud to carry on the tradition."

2307, "(fr)The Hercules Mark II

I recommend that you review the Herc II training modules before the Aquitaine arrives in Capella. These modules review advanced tactics, such as countermeasures and energy management. The Herc II is slower than the Myrmidon you've been flying with the 53rd, so learn how to evade missiles and equalize shields. These skills will help you push your fighter to the limits. Master them, and the life you save may be your own."

2308, "(fr)New Weapons

According to your file, you are now authorized to use the GTW-5a Prometheus R, the GTM-19 Harpoon, and the GTM-4 Hornet missile. 

The Prometheus R is a retrofit of a cannon developed during the Great War. After the Alliance lost contact with Earth, we lacked materials required for mass production, so engineers developed this retrofit version. The Prometheus packs a bigger wallop than the Subach HL-7, but it will drain your power reserves with extended use."

2309, "(fr)New Weapons

The Harpoon and the Hornet are both aspect-seeking missiles. While the Harpoon fires individual warheads, the Hornet launches a swarm of four projectiles, eight if you're in double-fire mode. The training modules cover the proper technique for firing aspect-seeking missiles, so be sure to review that section carefully. That's all for now, pilot. The Aquitaine will arrive in Capella in four hours."

2310, "(fr)Welcome to training simulator module TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. This module has been designed to acquaint pilots with communications systems, countermeasures, and aspect-seeking missiles."

2311, "(fr)Well done, pilot. You have successfully completed TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. You are advised to proceed to training simulator module TSM-107se, covering shield management and the energy transfer system."

2312, "(fr)Your performance was below acceptable standards for TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. You will not be advised to advance to the next training simulator module until you have completed this unit successfully. "

2330, "(fr)Welcome to module TSM-107m, pilot. Don't touch the controls until you are told to do so. You will fail this session if you do not follow instructions carefully."

2331, "(fr)Let's begin with messaging."

2332, "(fr)For Class A qualification, you learned how to call in a support ship to rearm and repair subsystems. Now we'll show you how to give orders to pilots under your command."

2333, "(fr)Our target for this simulation will be an Argo-class transport."

2334, "(fr)Target the transport. Use your hostile targeting control. [$h$]"

2335, "(fr)Good. Now you'll call in your reinforcements. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window. Select reinforcements [4]. Then select the wing you want to call in. Epsilon wing is your only option, so hit the [1] key."

2336, "(fr)Confirm that you still have the transport targeted. [$h$]"

2337, "(fr)Now have Epsilon wing destroy the transport. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging box again."

2338, "(fr)Select [2] to transmit your orders to a specific wing. Then hit [1] to choose Epsilon wing.  By selecting Epsilon wing, you are sending your orders to that wing only."

2339, "(fr)Now press the [1] key, and Epsilon will destroy your target."

2340, "(fr)Well done, pilot! Let's try this again."

2341, "(fr)Order Epsilon wing to destroy Transport 02. Do you remember your previous instruction?  If not, consult the directives list."

2342, "(fr)Good work. Be aware that fighter wings are less effective against larger targets. Bombers or vessels with beam turrets are usually required to destroy warships larger than cruiser class."

2343, "(fr)Also note that reinforcements are not always available, and you will have authorization to issue orders only to specific wings and ships."

2344, "(fr)Now let's order Epsilon wing to depart."

2345, "(fr)Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

2346, "(fr)Excellent work. As you gain experience in combat, using the communications interface will become second nature."

2347, "(fr)All right, pilot. Now it's time to learn about countermeasures."

2348, "(fr)When you launch a countermeasure, you present a new target for pursuing missiles. In theory, the missiles should hit the countermeasure instead of ripping a hole through your hull."

2349, "(fr)You need to use countermeasures to survive in battle, but you'll soon learn this tactic does not always work."

2350, "(fr)For this exercise, we'll bring in a Leviathan-class cruiser."

2351, "(fr)The cruiser will now launch missiles at you.  Press the countermeasures [$x$] key to evade the missiles."

2352, "(fr)Immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum and move away from the pursuing missiles.  Punch your afterburners [$tab$] to gain that extra burst of speed."

2353, "(fr)A yellow triangle will appear on your HUD, indicating the vector of the missile's approach. Try to keep this indicator in the 3 or 9 o'clock position."

2354, "(fr)When the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile. The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

2355, "(fr)While launching countermeasures, turn your fighter hard in sharp movements. This will also help throw the missile off your trail."

2356, "(fr)If you evade the missile, an indicator will display in the upper portion of your targeting reticle. This will alert you to the fact that you successfully avoided the projectile."

2357, "(fr)The number of countermeasures remaining is indicated on your HUD below the weapons display. If you run out of countermeasures, call in the support ship to reload."

2358, "(fr)You've sustained heavy damage from those missiles, pilot. You are advised to review TSM-107m. Your chances of survival will be minimal if you cannot use countermeasures effectively."

2359, "(fr)That's enough for evading missiles. Now let's practice firing them."

2360, "(fr)Your Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter is armed with two banks of Harpoons."

2361, "(fr)Unlike heat-seekers like the Rockeye, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

2362, "(fr)However, the aspect seeker is well worth the effort because its homing ability is much stronger."

2363, "(fr)If a heat seeker loses track of its target, chances are it will not reacquire lock. Aspect seekers, on the other hand, will track their targets until they detonate."

2364, "(fr)Transport 03 is now entering.  Let's take this opportunity to learn another targeting control."

2365, "(fr)You have a reticle targeting control [$y$] that will acquire the nearest object inside your reticle. Maneuver your fighter so that my ship is centered on your HUD."

2366, "(fr)Good. Now use the reticle targeting control [$y$] to target my fighter."

2367, "(fr)Well done. Now target Transport 03 using the reticle targeting control. [$y$] Make sure the transport is in the center of your HUD."

2368, "(fr)Excellent. Now let's see how you do with those Harpoons."

2369, "(fr)Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Triangle.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This means your Harpoons are locked and ready to fire."

2370, "(fr)Now fire one Harpoon at the freighter."

2371, "(fr)Note how fast the Harpoon moves.  This warhead delivers quite a punch."

2372, "(fr)A round of Harpoons can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

2373, "(fr)The Harpoon is almost useless if fired before lock has been acquired. That's a major distinction between the Harpoon and the Rockeye."

2374, "(fr)Now unload your Harpoons until you've destroyed Transport 03."

2375, "(fr)Excellent job.  Let's see how you do against moving targets."

2376, "(fr)In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed position inside your HUD reticle."

2377, "(fr)We'll now bring in the fighter drones. When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock. Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

2378, "(fr)Once you have acquired lock, fire a Harpoon to destroy the drone.  These drones will not be using countermeasures."

2379, "(fr)Well done.  All aspect seekers function this way, from the Hornet missile to the Helios torpedo. In general, the larger and more powerful the warhead, the longer it will take to acquire lock and countdown between volleys."

2380, "(fr)Now let's have you face a real challenge.  Multiple wings will appear simultaneously.  Destroy them all."

2381, "(fr)You must be in range of your target before you can gain aspect lock.  Hit your burners to intercept the drones."

2382, "(fr)Your missile banks are almost depleted. Call in the support ship to rearm. [Press $Shift-R$]"

2383, "(fr)Well done. This concludes module TSM-107m. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2403, "(fr)Welcome to module TSM-107se, pilot. Don't touch the controls until you are told to do so. You will fail this session if you do not follow instructions carefully."

2404, "(fr)First, let's take a look at the gauges and controls for your shield system."

2405, "(fr)The Alliance acquired shielding technology from the Shivans during the Great War. Shield systems have been standard on Terran-Vasudan fighters and bombers for over thirty years."

2406, "(fr)Your shield system generates an energy shell that protects the hull of your ship from primary fire and missile blasts."

2407, "(fr)As they absorb damage, your shields will weaken. However, your fighter will automatically regenerate its shields over time."

2408, "(fr)Your shield integrity gauge is located in the lower right of your HUD.  This gauge is now flashing."

2409, "(fr)Your shield is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant can withstand limited damage."

2410, "(fr)When a shield quadrant sustains damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

2411, "(fr)Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken a hit."

2412, "(fr)Observe how the gauge changes as your shield sustains more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage on that quadrant will impact the hull of your fighter."

2413, "(fr)Your shields will regenerate themselves automatically.  Let's accelerate this process to save time."

2414, "(fr)Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

2415, "(fr)Your shield is now fully recharged."

2416, "(fr)Effective shield management can mean the difference between life and death."

2417, "(fr)The simplest way to manage your shield is the Equalize Quadrants function."

2418, "(fr)I have damaged your front quadrant again.  Use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your shields.  [Press $q$]"

2419, "(fr)Well done.  Your front section has been partially recharged.  This shield energy came from your other three quadrants."

2420, "(fr)Practice this function often."

2421, "(fr)I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero power."

2422, "(fr)With your shield management controls, you can maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

2423, "(fr)First, maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]"

2424, "(fr)Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the other quadrants have been drained."

2425, "(fr)Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking the turret of a large ship."

2426, "(fr)Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

2427, "(fr)If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can deflect the gunfire of your pursuer."

2428, "(fr)Now Equalize Quadrants again to distribute shield energy evenly around your ship. [$q$]"

2429, "(fr)We will conclude this module with an overview of your energy transfer system, or ETS."

2430, "(fr)You can use your ETS controls to augment or diminish the energy allocated to each of these three systems."

2431, "(fr)First, let's increase your weapons energy allocation. [Press $insert$ four times.] Observe that as you divert power to weapons, the energy levels for shields and engines drop."

2432, "(fr)The more energy diverted to weapons, the faster your primaries will recharge. Your weapons will not inflict greater damage at higher ETS levels."

2433, "(fr)High-energy cannons, such as the Prometheus, can quickly deplete your weapon reserves. If you require a sustained barrage of gunfire, diverting energy to primaries may be necessary."

2434, "(fr)Now let's increase your shield allocation. [Press $home$ three times.]"

2435, "(fr)The higher your ETS setting for shields, the faster they'll recharge. Increasing your shield allocation may be critical in combat situations, such as stopping to rearm your fighter or flying through heavy flak."

2436, "(fr)Now divert more power to your engines. [Press $page up$ twice.]"

2437, "(fr)Increasing power to engines will improve your maximum speed by up to 30%, depending on the fighter's reactor capacity. Your afterburners will also recharge faster, enabling more frequent bursts of speed."

2438, "(fr)For a slower fighter like the Hercules Mark II, increasing engine power may be necessary to chase down more maneuverable targets or cover large distances quickly."

2439, "(fr)Well done. This concludes module TSM-107se. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2440, "(fr)You did not follow instructions. You have failed module TSM-107se. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation. [$Alt-J$]"

2441, "(fr)In the lower right of your HUD are three bar gauges labeled G for guns, S for shields, and E for engines."

2442, "(fr)Training 6"

2443, "(fr)Welcome

Lieutenant Commander Cordova here. Welcome to the 242nd Suicide Kings, pilot. I've heard from unofficial channels that the rebels have launched a surprise attack in the Epsilon Pegasi system. Details at this point are sketchy below Phi level clearance, and Command is in no hurry to fill us in. Petrarch says he'll brief the Aquitaine when we reach Capella."

2444, "(fr)The 242nd Suicide Kings

The GTA formed the Suicide Kings in the Great War, when the old Valkyrie fighter went into service after the Shivan attack on Ross 128. The 242nd was stationed on the Galatea back then, and our first mission was the capture of Lieutenant Alexander McCarthy. We all studied the McCarthy trials in school, pilot. We're a part of history here, though the Galatea is long gone and the Valkyrie has since been retired."

2445, "(fr)The Perseus Interceptor

The Perseus is the next-generation interceptor, the fastest fighter in the GTVA. Our primary combat role is charging bombers and chasing down warheads. We're also assigned to surgical strikes against bigger warships. We're not called the Suicide Kings for nothing, pilot. We earn that name on every mission. For that reason, I suggest you review the Perseus training modules as soon as possible. There you'll learn how to target bombs and turrets and everything else you need to serve in an intercept squadron."

2446, "(fr)Stiletto II

You are now authorized to use the GTM-43a Stiletto II missile, designed to incapacitate subsystems. The 43a improves on the original Stiletto design by modifying its guidance systems and disruptor charge. The Stiletto also boasts a more powerful propulsion system, increasing its speed and effective range."

2447, "(fr)Welcome to training simulator module TSM-122x, advanced qualification for the Perseus intercept fighter. This module has been designed to acquaint pilots with targeting bombs, turrets, and subsystems."

2448, "(fr)Well done, pilot. You have successfully completed TSM-122x, advanced qualification for the Perseus intercept fighter. Good luck with your upcoming assignment."

2449, "(fr)Your performance was below acceptable standards for TSM-122x, advanced qualification for the Perseus intercept fighter. You are advised to repeat this training module until you have completed its course of instruction successfully."

2468, "(fr)The most significant role of the Perseus interceptor fighter is destroying enemy bombers and their warheads."

2469, "(fr)For this exercise, we need a target. Let's bring in a Deimos-class corvette."

2470, "(fr)Remember the escort list? It's on the right-hand side of your HUD. Use the escort targeting control to select the Deimos. [$e$]"

2471, "(fr)Good. Now let's make this interesting. Here comes a wing of Shivan Seraphim bombers."

2472, "(fr)Don't be afraid. This is only a training simulator. Just observe the action for now."

2473, "(fr)As the Seraphim bombers approach the Deimos, they launch their ordnance."

2474, "(fr)Use the bomb targeting control [$b$] to acquire the Shivan warheads. If there are no warheads in flight, this control will select the nearest bomber."

2475, "(fr)The bomb will appear in your Target View until it detonates. Observe that as the bomb impacts the hull of the Deimos, the name of the corvette flashes in your escort monitor. That's how you know a ship on your escort list is taking damage."

2476, "(fr)Bombs also appear as amber blips on your radar."

2477, "(fr)Let's cover one more targeting control. The Target's Attacker function [$g$] enables you to select the enemy ship attacking your target. This is especially useful in defensive or escort missions."

2478, "(fr)First, select the vessel you have been ordered to defend. Cycle through friendly targets [$f$] or use the escort targeting control. [$e$]"

2479, "(fr)Very good. Now use the target's attacker control [$g$] to acquire the nearest hostile currently attacking your target. That would be the Seraphim."

2480, "(fr)Now let's see how well you do in a combat situation. To make things fair, we'll restore the Deimos to full strength."

2481, "(fr)Before we unleash the bombers, here are a few more pointers."

2482, "(fr)First, locate the bomb by sensors or by sight. You'll destroy the bombs more efficiently if you can rely on visual contact, but sometimes you'll need to use the bomb targeting control if you get disoriented. [$b$]"

2483, "(fr)It only takes one or two hits to destroy a bomb, and most warheads are generally slower than your intercept fighter. But don't get too close. The shockwave could damage your hull or knock out your subsystems."

2484, "(fr)Obviously, the best tactic is to destroy the bombers before they launch their ordnance. An intercept fighter is built for speed so that you can engage multiple bomber waves across the field of engagement."

2485, "(fr)You lost the Deimos, pilot. It's a challenge but not impossible. We'll abort the simulation now so you can start over and try again."

2486, "(fr)Excellent work, pilot. You repelled the bomber attack and protected the Deimos."

2487, "(fr)Here's another tip. Using the messaging window, you can order your squadmates to protect a target. Pilots assigned to protect a target will help you intercept bombs launched at the target. Chasing bombs is a lot easier when you work together as a team."

2488, "(fr)You have depleted your missile banks, pilot. Call in the support ship to rearm. [$Shift-R$]"

2489, "(fr)For the next phase of this simulation, let's restore the Deimos to full strength. We'll also change the vessel's IFF status from friendly to hostile."

2490, "(fr)Target the corvette using your hostile targeting control.  [Press $h$]"

2491, "(fr)Good. As a fighter, you have minimal chance of destroying a large ship on your own. Bombs and beam cannons are much more effective, but these weapons are too big to mount on a fighter."

2492, "(fr)However, the speed and maneuverability of the fighter make it ideal for surgical strikes against the turrets and subsystems of larger ships."

2493, "(fr)Use the turret targeting control [$k$] to cycle through the turrets of the ship. Observe that the corvette has a range of weapon types, including beam weapons, laser cannons, flak guns, and missile launchers. I'm sure you're well acquainted with all of these by now."

2494, "(fr)Observe how the turret is outlined by a large square. The Target View will display the type of turret and its current integrity.  If the targeted object is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2495, "(fr)Now target the missile launchers on the Deimos and destroy them."

2496, "(fr)Excellent. Once you destroy a turret, your sensors will automatically target the next turret in order of priority."

2497, "(fr)Larger warships have dozens of firing points, and in combat situations, you might not have time to cycle through all the turrets to find the one that is firing at you."

2498, "(fr)You have an attacker targeting control [$r$] that will select the nearest hostile firing on your ship. If the attacker is a warship, the turret firing on you will be targeted."

2499, "(fr)This control can help you prioritize the enemies that pose the greatest danger to your fighter."

2500, "(fr)Let's try it now. The Deimos will begin firing on you with one or more of its turrets. "

2501, "(fr)Use your attacker targeting control [$r$] to identify the turret firing on you."

2502, "(fr)Now destroy the turret. Feel free to use guns and missiles. Note that both heat-seeking and aspect-seeking missiles will home in on subsystems once they acquire lock."

2503, "(fr)Good. Now let's see how you do against multiple turrets."

2504, "(fr)Great work, pilot."

2505, "(fr)Looks like you've had enough. In the field of battle, approach a warship with the utmost caution. With a fast and light ship like the Perseus, stay on the move at all times. Destroy the turret in two or three strafing runs if you have to."

2506, "(fr)Let's end this session with a look at targeting subsystems."

2507, "(fr)By pressing the subsystem targeting control [$s$] repeatedly, you can cycle through the subsystems of your target."

2508, "(fr)A subsystem appears on your HUD outlined by a large square. If the targeted system is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2509, "(fr)Now target the sensors on the corvette.  [Press $s$]"

2510, "(fr)Nice work. Now select the Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun, or SDG, as your primary weapons. [$.$]"

2511, "(fr)The Akheton SDG is an energy weapon developed by the Vasudans. The Akheton destroys the subsystems of a target, doing only minimal damage to the target's hull."

2512, "(fr)Using the Akheton SDG, destroy the sensors of the Deimos corvette."

2513, "(fr)Good. Note that you can also order your squadmates to destroy the subsystems of your target. In the messaging window, select the Disable command to take out the engines. The Disarm command will order the pilots to destroy your target's weapons subsystem."

2514, "(fr)Well done. This concludes module TSM-122x. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2515, "(fr)You did not follow instructions. You have failed module TSM-122x Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation. [$Alt-J$]"

2516, "(fr)Now, intercept and destroy the Seraphim bombers before they neutralize the corvette."

2517, "(fr)The first act of the main FreeSpace 2 campaign."

The challenge of maintaining an aging fleet has motivated the GTVA to develop a new generation of ships able to withstand long-term abuse in the field. By maximizing shielding and payload (while offering enough maneuverability to make it a viable tactical unit), the Boanerges promises to remain in service for decades to come. One test pilot observed that the Boanerges handles better than any other bomber and has enough firepower to make it a formidable anti-capship weapon."

3035, "(fr)The GTDr Amazon Model IV unmanned combat drone was once used for live basic combat training. They weren't tough, they weren't smart, and they weren't well armored. But they blew up very nicely. These drones are no longer manufactured, but their virtual counterparts are used in the Training Simulator Module (TSM) series. The Model IV is every fighter pilot's first TSM opponent, the first mobile foe he faces during simulator courses. If you can't handle an Amazon during training, it's time to reconsider your choice of careers."

3036, "(fr)The GTDr Amazon Advanced Model VII was an unmanned combat drone used for advanced flight combat training. It was larger, smarter, and more heavily armored than the basic Amazon drone. As with the basic Amazon, these are now encountered only in the virtual battlefields of the TSM training module series. The Model VII is used to simulate assaults on enemy capital ships, training fighter and bomber pilots to target turrets and ship subsystems. Command has found that virtual training against Model VIIs increases the survival rate of pilots by 37% when attacking capital ships."

3037, "(fr)The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Triton Dynamics designed the Hygeia class with huge cargo bays for munitions storage, plus the latest magnetic-stasis delivery system for quickly re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3038, "(fr)The GTFr Triton hauls almost twice the tonnage of the Poseidon-class freighters that have served the Alliance since the Great War. The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTVA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

3039, "(fr)TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTVA reuses the containers in many capacities."

3040, "(fr)The GTFr Poseidon is the smaller of the two standard Terran military freighters. Though it carries only half as much cargo as the Triton, the Poseidon is more often chosen for dangerous missions. Its greater speed gives it better survivability on the front lines, as does the fact that it has four weapon turrets, compared to the Triton's two. When Allied Command sends supplies and munitions that have to get through, a Poseidon is usually chosen to transport them."

3041, "(fr)
The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTVA for deep space cargo transport. Its thin hull will preserve Terran-standard atmospheric conditions inside, as long as the hull seal has not been comprised by weapon fire or collision. TC 2 containers are cheap to manufacture and heavily used everywhere but the front lines (where the armored TAC 1 containers are employed, when available)."

3042, "(fr)
The TSC 2 container is armored, providing more protection for its cargo than does the TC 2. This armor serves mainly to protect against hull breaches due to collisions, as it's not thick enough to provide much protection against enemy attacks. TSC 2s are used in busy supply depots in which collision damage is a hazard."

3043, "(fr)The TAC 1 is a very heavily armored type of Terran cargo container. It is most often used to hold delicate or valuable cargoes. TAC 1s are generally found in front-line operations in which protection from enemy attacks is a primary consideration."

3044, "(fr)The TTC 1 is a civilian cargo container modified for military use. It is a dense-hulled container originally designed to protect fragile technical and scientific equipment. The same protection is now used to guard against collision and attack damage to replacement ship subsystems and other electronic equipment intended for combat spacecraft."

3045, "(fr)The GTC Fenris class is the aging stalwart among the Alliance's warships. Before the Great War, the Fenris was Terran Command's only class of cruisers. During the war, Terran Command decided to build a second line of cruisers, the Leviathans, to free the Fenris from escort and guard duties. Fenris cruisers have fought in virtually every theatre of operation. These fast, versatile cruisers pack enough punch in their 260-meter-long hulls to go toe-to-toe with any enemy cruiser. The Fenris's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for strike missions."

3046, "(fr)Terrans developed the GTM Hippocrates early in the post-war Reconstruction period. With the outbreak of the NTF insurgency, the GTVA has once again called the Hippocrates into active military service. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Allied-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach."

3047, "(fr)Early in the Great War, Han-Ronald engineers designed and built the Leviathan class of cruisers. The Leviathan is much heavier armed and armored than the Fenris, but also much slower and less maneuverable. Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations, where firepower is king and speed is of little importance. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. The Fenris is good for fast-moving operations, but when you need some muscle, call in a Leviathan."

3048, "(fr)The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines."

3049, "(fr)When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTVA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTVA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

3050, "(fr)Ships of the GTA Charybdis class have been packed with the latest tachyon-enabled AWACS equipment from GTVI labs. Each GTVA battle group has a squadron of Charybdis-class ships assigned to it. These ships double the range of the group's standard detection arrays. Charybdis ships' thin armor and weak defenses make them easy victims for enemy bombers. They have proven indispensable, however, in forays into the nebula beyond the Knossos portal. Charybdis-class ships are very vulnerable in this environment, as witnessed by the recent loss of the GTA Panopticon from the 3rd Battle Group."

3051, "(fr)For over 30 years, the GTD Orion class was the largest ship in the Terran-Vasudan armada. Over two kilometers in length, bristling with dozens of death-dealing turrets, the Orion is as awesome in repose as it is in battle. All GVTA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers. The Orion's cavernous hanger bays easily accommodate more than two dozen fighter or bomber wings."

3052, "(fr)The new GTD Hecate class of destroyers is replacing the Orion class as the flagship of Terran battle groups. More heavily armed than the Orion, the Hecate also carries over 150 combat spacecraft and a crew of 10,000. The GTD Aquitaine is a superb example of this new ship class, serving as the flagship of the Capella-based 3rd Fleet."

3053, "(fr)The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources."

3054, "(fr)The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

3055, "(fr)The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups."

3056, "(fr)Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet."

3057, "(fr)The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however."

3058, "(fr)The Iceni is the NTF command frigate, built under Admiral Bosch's direction at the Freedom shipyards in Polaris, captured by the Neo-Terran Front at the start of their rebellion.  With over two dozen turrets and a sheath of ultra-dense depleted uranium shielding around its subsystems, the Iceni is an extremely tough nut to crack. With Bosch on board, providing tactical guidance, the Iceni is the equal of any GTVA battle group. Intelligence believes the ship was custom-designed for a secret NTF project."

3059, "(fr)Hidden NTF asteroid base."

3060, "(fr)The GTT Elysium class of transports has been in service for over 40 years. Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class."

3061, "(fr)The GTT Argo has become the standard military transport vehicle for the Terran fleet. Argos sometimes carry new weapon and combat craft prototypes to and from testing grounds or to front-line deployment positions. Military VIPs occasionally commandeer Argos to travel from star system to star system in some semblance of comfort. Argos are most often used as assault transports, carrying squads of Marines through heavy flak to board enemy vessels that Command has decided to capture rather than destroy."

3062, "(fr)The GTI Ganymede is the Alliance's newest repair and resupply facility. Ganymede installations are currently deployed behind the front lines in the Vega, Vasuda, and Capella systems. Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTVA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

3063, "(fr)The subspace portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system in 2367. The interlocking circular motions of its components apparently create a subspace vortex that connects the Gamma Draconis system to another part of our universe.  Dr. Hargrove's team continues to study the device, though their findings are highly classified."

3064, "(fr)The GTSG Watchdog was the first generation of Terran sentry platform, the distant precursor to the Cerberus and Alastor platforms. Seriously underpowered by today's standards, the Watchdog also suffers from paper-thin armor. Many Watchdogs are Great War relics left active and in place because it wasn't worthwhile removing or deactivating them. The NTF occasionally uses stolen Watchdogs to guard supply depots or minor installations."

3065, "(fr)Until the advent of the GTSG Alastor, the GTSG Cerberus was the most advanced sentry gun emplacement available to Terran forces. They were vital to Terran defenses during the Great War, racking up over 100 kills of Vasudan and Shivan combat craft. But the current conflict has found them primarily in back-line roles, guarding installations deemed relatively safe from attack. With no mobility and only two Subach HL-7 turrets, they serve as more of a distraction than a viable threat to modern combat craft."

3066, "(fr)GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. Two Bessmer-Kohn cannon turrets on opposing sides of the platform give the Alastor a full field of fire. The turrets are controlled by the latest neural-net cyber-AI to track multiple targets simultaneously."

3067, "(fr)The GTEP Hermes escape pod is now standard equipment on every GTVA warship of cruiser size or larger. Each ship has several escape pods magnetically coupled to airlocks scattered around the ship's outer hull. Not intended for whole-crew evacuations, the Hermes has space for up to 20 crew members. Each pod is propelled by a small fusion engine, enough to remove the pod from the immediate vicinity of an exploding warship. It is also capable of subspace jumps."

Its thin armor and weak shields give it a low survival rate in dogfights against more heavily armored fighters. Despite having only two primary and secondary weapon banks, the Serapis has been retrofitted to accommodate almost any loadout in the GTVA arsenal. Veteran Vasudan pilots love the Serapis for its agility and loadout options. Some Terran pilots who've been privileged enough to fly it claim to prefer it to any Terran fighter."

Its unusual configuration was inspired by the Apsu-Hek, a creature that once inhabited the deserts of Vasuda Prime. The Apsu-Hek has become an emblem of the Vasudan diaspora, and the Tauret continues the tradition of symbolic design. Armed with four gun mounts and two missile banks, the Tauret has the speed and firepower to challenge both fighters and warships."

The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime."

Designed to be invisible to standard detection arrays mounted on combat craft, Ptahs have performed admirably during their OpEval period. The masking materials and blending technologies used across their outer surfaces seem to confuse Shivan detection systems as well. The Ptah is currently available only to select fighter units in the Vasudan navy, with no word on when they will be more widely distributed."

3123, "(fr)The GVS Nephtys is the Vasudans' new support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The high number of warheads carried by the Nephtys makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3124, "(fr)The GVT Isis is most often used as a military personnel transport but also occasionally serves as a repair ship or even a tugboat, helping to maneuver large vessels into docking bays. Two cannon turrets and thick molybdenum plating serve to protect its cargo. Magnetic cargo locks located on the Isis's undercarriage enable it to transport small cargo containers of supplies and munitions in emergencies."

3125, "(fr)The Ma'at freighter class has served the Vasudan navy for over 50 years. More than 200 of these vessels still serve the GTVA, carrying desperately needed supplies, foodstuffs, and munitions to every theatre of the war. With only three weapon turrets, a lone Ma'at is easy prey for a wing of enemy bombers. Thus Ma'ats usually travel in mixed convoys with other freighters, guarded by cruisers and fighter wings."

3126, "(fr)For the past 20 years, the GVFr Bes has been the mainstay of Vasudan shipping fleets. While some Terran systems languished in the post-war era, the Vasudans experienced an economic recovery that was miraculous, given the annihilation of their home planet. Experts credit the policies of the restored Imperial government that emerged following Khonsu II's dissolution of the Vasudan parliament. As commerce among the Vasudan systems resumed and expanded into Terran worlds, a new generation of space-faring cargo vessels was required to meet the needs of this burgeoning economy."

3129, "(fr)When the first Satis-class freighter was encountered by Terran forces during the Terran-Vasudan War, its firepower led Terran Command to classify it as a light cruiser. Only after a disabled Satis was captured did its true nature become known. Now designated the GVFr Satis class, these freighters still serve as an iron fist within the velvet glove of a freighter convoy. Few enemy fighters who mistake a Satis for a Ma'at or Bes live to regret their error."

3130, "(fr)The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet."

3131, "(fr)The GVC Aten is among the smallest of the GTVA's cruiser classes, with thin armor and only a few, relatively weak turrets. Terran fighters and bombers exploited these weaknesses during the early years of the Great War, when the Terrans and Vasudans were still enemies. The Aten is most often seen in the current conflict as a rear-guard defense for convoys or installations, backing up wings of fighters and bombers."

3132, "(fr)The GVC Mentu cruiser is the lightest of the new Vasudan warships. Following the Great War, allied scientists developed the beam cannons that now serve as the primary armaments of today's GTVA warships. Rather than modify existing ships, the Vasudans developed new designs to mount these weapons. The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi."

3133, "(fr)Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves."

3134, "(fr)The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice."

3135, "(fr)The GVSG Ankh sentry gun platform is the Vasudan equivalent of the GTSG Watchdog. Both are Great War relics that perform poorly by modern standards. The Ankh serves to guard back-line storage depots and installations. With no armor or shielding, the Ankh is easily destroyed. Its two small turrets can deter unarmed raiders or badly damaged fighters, but it poses little threat to most combat craft."

3136, "(fr)When the GTVA asked the Vasudan navy to upgrade the Great War-era Ankh sentry gun platform, the GVSG Edjo was the Vasudans' answer. The Edjo has significantly more armor plating than the Ankh, improving its survivability, but the Vasudans placed only one small cannon turret on the new platform, giving it half the punch of the Ankh. After seeing the Edjo, the Terrans quietly began developing their own advanced sentry gun platforms. The Vasudan navy seems content to leave this aspect of military technology to the Terrans."

3137, "(fr)The GVEP Ra escape pod has been the standard emergency vehicle on Vasudan capital ships since the Terran-Vasudan War. In keeping with Vasudan philosophies, the Ra is almost never used to evacuate personnel, but instead is employed to preserve records and other data that could be of use to the allies. Thus Ra-class craft have minimal life support systems and a small fusion engine. The energy supplied by the escape pod's powerplant goes almost entirely to powering the pod's homing beacon."

3138, "(fr)The GVA Setekh is the Vasudan class of AWACS vessels, comparable to the Terran GTA Charybdis class. Setekhs are smaller, less heavily armored, and have half the turrets of Charybdis ships. Despite these shortcomings, the Vasudan navy insists upon deploying Setekhs in Vasudan battle groups, claiming the Vasudan versions are more appropriate for their fleets. Setekhs' crystalline detection arrays provide their fleets with doubled radar range within the nebular region. Every Vasudan battle group operating in this theatre has a wing of Setekhs attached to it."

3139, "(fr)In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet."

3140, "(fr)The Shivan fighter class SF Dragon is a fast, extremely agile craft. Its twin lasers pack a deadly punch. The Dragon's weakness seems to be a thin hull. The trouble is that their speed and maneuverability make them extremely difficult to hit."

3141, "(fr)The SF Basilisk is a Shivan heavy attack fighter. Slow but heavily armed and well-protected, the Basilisk targets slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3142, "(fr)The Manticore fighter is the fastest known craft in the Shivan armada. With a single, powerful laser and two missile banks, it is a dangerous offensive weapon. Its Achilles' heel lies in its thin hull and weak shields. Manticores do not last long in dogfights against other fighters. They prefer to target bombers, which are nearly helpless against the Manticore's speed and weaponry."

3143, "(fr)The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3144, "(fr)The SF Mara class of Shivan fighters was first encountered by the GTC Vigilant while patrolling the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. All other information concerning the Mara is classified level Psi."

3145, "(fr)First encountered in Gamma Draconis, the SF Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly."

3146, "(fr)The SB Nephilim is the slowest of the Shivan bomber classes. These craft were first encountered during the Great War and are still found in many Shivan attack formations. Nephilims are heavily armored and shielded, enabling them to deliver their devastating payloads despite their lack of speed."

3147, "(fr)The SB Taurvi is a Shivan vessel that has only recently been encountered. The Taurvi is one of the weaker Shivan bomber classes, but still the equal of every bomber in the GTVA arsenal. Not as maneuverable as a Nahema, nor as tough as a Seraphim or Nephilim, the Taurvi appears to be a Shivan compromise between speed and power."

3148, "(fr)Either the SB Nahema class is a new Shivan bomber design, or the Shivans are finally taking the GTVA seriously and bringing in their best ships. The Nahema is considered to be the Shivan's most dangerous bomber. It has demonstrated the ability to outrun virtually every fighter in the GTVA fleet. Its powerful laser banks and high-capacity missile bays make it a threat to combat craft of all types, as well as to capital ships."

3149, "(fr)The SB Seraphim is a familiar foe to GTVA forces. They appear to be similar to Nephilims in speed, armor, and shield strength, but have demonstrated a larger bomb capacity."

3150, "(fr)Encountered on rare occasions since the Shivans first entered the Great War, the ST Azrael is the only known class of Shivan transport. Little is known about it even now, but it is believed to house many Shivans within its thin hulls. Since Azraels might be carrying Shivan pilots or other skilled crew members, it is always worthwhile to eliminate these lightly defended ships."

3151, "(fr)The SFr Dis class of freighters is smaller than the Asmodeus class and not as well armed. It is still much more dangerous to attack than the GTVA's Triton or Poseidon freighters, however."

3152, "(fr)The SAC 3 is the most common Shivan cargo container found thus far. Its thin plating is barely enough to maintain the interior atmospheric integrity against the vacuum of space. As no additional effort was made to armor these containers against attack, it is assumed that only items of low value or importance are carried within. Nevertheless, standing orders are to capture these containers at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3153, "(fr)The SFr Mephisto class is equivalent to the Dis class in size and combat capabilities. Given their wildly different configurations, they must serve different purposes for the Shivans, but Allied Intelligence currently offers no further information on this matter."

3154, "(fr)The SC 5 class of Shivan cargo container is functionally identical to the SAC 3 class, as far as GTVA engineers have been able to determine. As with all Shivan cargo containers, standing orders are to capture at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3155, "(fr)Little is known about the SFr Asmodeus line of freighters. With a strong hull and four weapon turrets, they are the most dangerous Shivan freighters to attack. Nothing is known of the cargo Asmodeus freighters commonly carry."

3156, "(fr)The SAC 2 is a heavily armored variant of the standard Shivan cargo container. Equipment found in captured SAC 2s appears to be more fragile than that found in the more common SAC 3s. SAC 2 cargo containers are to be captured rather than destroyed at every opportunity. If the choice is between destruction and allowing the container to be recovered by Shivan forces, pilots are authorized to destroy the container."

3157, "(fr)The SC Lilith class of Shivan cruisers is a far-deadlier foe than the Cain class. Nearly impenetrable armor plating enables it to withstand tremendous punishment, enabling its nine turrets to lash out at warships and combat spacecraft with impunity."

3158, "(fr)Though not as thickly armored as the Lilith class, the SC Rakshasa class of Shivan cruisers is far deadlier. With over a dozen turrets, the Rakshasa is the most heavily armed Shivan cruiser class. It was a Rakshasa cruiser that destroyed the GTC Vigilant at the Gamma Draconis node in the Capella system."

3159, "(fr)The weakest of the Shivan cruiser classes is designated SC Cain. These vessels were commonly encountered during Great War battles. Cains are considered to be slightly stronger than the GTC Fenris cruiser class."

3160, "(fr)The SD Demon class of Shivan destroyers is much smaller than the Lucifer class but very heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Demons are known to carry numerous wings of fighters and bombers."

3161, "(fr)The SD Ravana is a destroyer class GTVA forces have only recently encountered. It appears to be tasked with clearing out smaller foes, a mission for which it is well suited. It eagerly wipes out wings of fighters and bombers and also overwhelms cruisers and corvettes."

3162, "(fr)The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion."

3163, "(fr)The SSG Trident line of sentry gun platforms is well known from numerous encounters during the Great War. These are still used to guard Shivan installations, but many of the stronger Belial platforms have been deployed to the most critical defensive positions."

3164, "(fr)The SSG Belial sentry gun platform appears to be a radical redesign of the Trident platform that was first encountered during the Great War. Pilots who have encountered both report that the Belial is harder to kill. It is reliably known that the Belial has twice as many laser turrets as the Trident sentry gun. Both types are used to guard storage depots, gas miners, and other Shivan installations."

3165, "(fr)Almost nothing is known of the Rahu line of gas miners. It is assumed that they function in much the same way as our Zephyrus miners, funneling nebular gas into internal machinery that fractionates it into its molecular components for further processing. Rahu miners are armed with heavy laser turrets, so care must be taken when attacking them."

3166, "(fr)Only one class of Shivan ship is classified as a corvette - the SCv Moloch class. Though they're physically as large as the GTCv Deimos class, Molochs do not seem to pack the same punch. They are far more deadly than any Shivan cruisers, however."

3184, "(fr)The Great War"

3185, "(fr)In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

>From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

According to declassified transmissions, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

3186, "(fr)Reconstruction"

3187, "(fr)By the end of 2335, the Great War was over. The victory over the Lucifer had dealt the decisive blow. Incapable of coordinated strikes or strategic planning, the Shivans were outmaneuvered, isolated, and gradually destroyed. However, both species faced the challenge of rebuilding their interstellar societies from the ground up.

An ill-fated coup d'etat, orchestrated by the rogue intelligence branch of the GTA, marked the beginning of post-war factional politics. With its economy in ruins and political structures in turmoil, the Galactic Terran Alliance disintegrated into semi-autonomous regional blocs, each with its own agenda. The major entities included the Adhara Coalition, the Antares Federation, the Regulus Syndicate, and the Luyten New Alliance. As these groups consolidated and stabilized, the reconstruction gained momentum, and the resumption of open commerce rekindled the notion of a pan-Terran community.

Despite the annihilation of all life in their home system, the success of the Vasudan reconstruction surpassed that of their Terran allies. The Vasudans were governed by a Parliament until 2339, when the Vasudan Emperor, Khonsu II, dissolved this body and formed a new government, bringing an end to an institution notorious for its Byzantine treachery, corruption, and arrogance. The heir of a 10,000 year dynasty, Khonsu distinguished himself as a leader of unusual acumen and wisdom. Economists credit the Khonsu regime for the miraculous rehabilitation of Vasudan industry and society."

3188, "(fr)GTVA"

3189, "(fr)The Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA) was formed in 2345, ten years after the Great War. This treaty organization recognized the autonomy of its constituents as it provided a framework for trade and mutual defense. The Great War had transformed the enmity between Terrans and Vasudans into a lasting fellowship.

As the industry and economy of the Terran-Vasudan systems recovered, support for a more powerful GTVA gained momentum. In 2358, delegates signed into existence the Beta Aquilae Convention (BETAC), named after the system where the constitution was drafted and ratified. BETAC dismantled the governments of the Terran blocs and recognized the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Vasudan Imperium as the supreme authorities of Terran-Vasudan space.

Under BETAC, the Vasudans and the Terrans maintain separate fleets under a single command structure. A warship is designated GT or GV, indicating whether it is Galactic Terran or Galactic Vasudan. The two species openly exchange information and technology, and the most recent fighters and bombers can be modified to accommodate pilots of either species.

Technically, BETAC is but one of a series of conventions and treaties that define how the GTVA functions as a political, military, and economic entity. However, the significance of BETAC as the cornerstone of the Terran-Vasudan alliance has made it the favored target of NTF propagandists."

3190, "(fr)Earth"

3191, "(fr)In 2335, the destruction of the Lucifer superdestroyer collapsed the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis, severing all contact with Earth.

The fate of the Terran home planet remains open to speculation, though a number of scenarios are possible. As the center of an interstellar community, Earth could not survive in isolation without a radical transformation of its political and economic structures. On this point, there is no disagreement. However, the question remains whether this transition occurred peacefully or whether Terran society collapsed into anarchy. Strong arguments have been advanced for both sides.

For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation-states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society.

Though necessity has diminished Earth's practical importance in the post-war era, discovering the means to return home remains a high priority."

3192, "(fr)Neo-Terran Front"

3193, "(fr)Eighteen months ago, Admiral Aken Bosch, commander of the GTVA 6th Fleet, launched a violent military coup in the Polaris system. Within weeks, a regional domino effect also toppled the governments of Regulus and Sirius, all swearing allegiance to Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front.

Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra informs the ideology of his movement. Though Terrans have lived in exile from Earth since the end of the Great War, Bosch imagined a utopia that would restore the grandeur of the lost world. As the people of Earth once relied on Polaris to help them navigate the seas, the North Star would become the spiritual and political compass for Terrans of the new era. Bosch's message had a profound impact on the so-called Lost Generation, born during the post-war Reconstruction. The Neo-Terran Front provided the youth of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius with a cause to fight and die for.

Bosch succeeded because his pro-Terran ideology was explicitly anti-Vasudan. The NTF opposed any Terran-Vasudan alliance and called for the dissolution of the GTVA. The NTF core systems had suffered political and economic chaos throughout the post-war Reconstruction. The Vasudans' miraculous recovery under Khonsu II's leadership embittered those Terrans still struggling to rebuild their own systems. Bosch exploited this anti-Vasudan sentiment to achieve his own political ends."

3194, "(fr)Vasudans"

3195, "(fr)The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. Thirty years of peaceful interaction between Terrans and Vasudans has helped to deconstruct these stereotypes.

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device is standard on all GTVA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other.

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War. After the defeat of the Shivans, the Vasudans insisted on maintaining this convention. The Emperor strongly identified with the history of Ancient Egypt, particularly the longevity of its civilization. Following their Emperor's example, Vasudans will take on what they call a Terran name from the myths and history of Ancient Egypt."

3196, "(fr)Hammer of Light"

3197, "(fr)The dark side of the Vasudan obsession with history was the emergence during the Great War of Hammer of Light (HoL), a cult that gained a strong following among the PVN, resulting in defections to the HoL cause. The HoL believed the Shivans were the cosmic redeemers and destroyers predicted in obscure prophecies written thousands of years ago. Following the destruction of the Lucifer, the ideology and activities of Hammer of Light shifted.

While some followers committed ritual suicide, the military branch of the movement continued their armed opposition to the Vasudan government and its alliance with the Terrans. Though they continued to espouse HoL's religious dogma, their activities turned more toward acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare. This branch of the HoL was later crushed in Operation Templar, following the HoL's kidnapping of the Vasudan admiralty. Other HoL leaders vanished into obscurity, returning to the study of arcane texts. A number of these religious leaders were apprehended and imprisoned for their role in the insurgency, though a few are still in hiding."

3198, "(fr)Shivans"

3199, "(fr)32 years after the Great War, we still know almost nothing about the Shivans. 

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and all research on live specimens ended with the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. The results of these studies remain highly classified.

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. The most convincing evidence supporting this theory is the behavior of Shivan forces following the destruction of the Lucifer, the turning point of the Great War. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date."

3200, "(fr)The Ancients"

3201, "(fr)During the Great War, as the annihilation of Earth seemed imminent, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization we now call the Ancients. Data excavated at the site enabled the allies to track and destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace.

After the Great War, scientists uncovered more sites throughout Terran-Vasudan space. Though only fragments remain, this interstellar society thrived thousands of years ago. Their empire was more expansive than the current boundaries of known space, and archeologists believe they might eventually uncover a map of the Ancient nodes, enabling the Alliance to travel to systems previously uncharted. 

There is virtually no visual record of this civilization, except hieroglyphic forms discovered at the archeological sites and a handful of technological schematics. Major excavations are underway in Altair, Aldebaran, and Deneb, but the data gathered there remains classified at the highest level. 

Terran archeologists use a Minoan naming convention to identify sites and major artifacts. Current evidence suggests the Shivans exterminated this civilization over eight thousand years ago. The Ancients believed the Shivans were a race of cosmic destroyers, and that the extinction of their species was an act of retribution for striving beyond their ordained place in the cosmic order."

3202, "(fr)Subspace"

3203, "(fr)In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

3380, "(fr)The GTM-11 Infyrno is an area-effect bomber suppression weapon, often employed to knock out incoming waves of slow-moving bombers. Upon detonation, the Infyrno releases multiple submunitions that contain ultra-high-explosive charges. The Infyrno is detonated remotely by pressing the Secondary weapon trigger a second time. A HUD indicator displays the distance from the warhead to the firing ship. If the pilot triggers the detonation too early, he risks being caught in the Infyrno's extensive blast radius."

3383, "(fr)GTM-12 Cyclops"

3384, "(fr)The GTM-12 Cyclops has been in service for over 15 years in the GTVA arsenal. It is the standard ultra-high-delivery Secondary weapon loadout, utilizing the latest in aspect-seeking guidance technologies. The Cyclops has the distinction of being the most consistently upgraded weapon in the fleet. Although its development began shortly after the Great War ended, its excellent performance has kept it firmly entrenched in the role of main assault weapon. Its payload is approximately fifty percent greater than that of the older Tsunami warheads."

Anti-Capital Ship Weapon
Anti-Matter Torpedo"

3394, "(fr)GTM-13 Helios"

3395, "(fr)The GTM-13 Helios is the product of an entire generation of high-energy physics research, based primarily at the GTVA particle accelerator complex near Antares. The most powerful warhead in the fleet's arsenal, the Helios generates a massive shockwave from the cataclysmic annihilation of matter and anti-matter, triggered upon impact with its target. Each bank of Helios warheads can fire only once every 30 seconds. The Helios is prohibitively expensive to produce, thus its deployment is severely restricted."

Electromagnetic Pulse Weapon
General Purpose Suppression"

3398, "(fr)GTM-14 EM Pulse Adv."

3399, "(fr)The GTM-14 Electromagnetic Pulse Advanced warhead interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within its blast radius. This renders the affected ships unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock. Tactically, the GTM-14 is a very effective anti-bomber weapon, as it also temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight. This advanced version of the standard EM Pulse missile disrupts subsystems at a deeper circuitry level, resulting in a longer-lasting effect."

3400, "(fr)GTM MX-52"

3401, "(fr)Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

3402, "(fr)GTM MX-52

Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel based targets."

                                  FreeSpace 2: Das Launcher-Menü
                                 ---------------------------------------------------------

Mit Hilfe des Launcher-Menüs können Sie FreeSpace 2
starten und an Ihre Hardware anpassen können, neue
Versionen des Spiels herunterladen und die FreeSpace 2
Homepages im World Wide Web aufrufen. Hier eine kurze
Beschreibung für jeden Auswahlpunkt:


SPIELEN
  Startet das Spiel FreeSpace 2


SETUP
  Öffnet den Setup-Dialog, der wiederum in Grafik, Audio, Joystick,
Geschwindigkeit, Netzwerk, DirectX und Sonstiges eingeteilt ist.

3404, "(fr)
  * Grafik - Sie müssen eine 3D-Grafikkarte besitzen, um FreeSpace 2
spielen zu können. Sie können das Spiel nach Glide- und Direct3D-
kompatiblen Karten suchen lassen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im Interlaced-Modus abspielen' - Hierbei werden die
Bilder in zwei Durchgängen gezeichnet, damit langsamere Grafikkarten
damit zurechtkommen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im FastClear-Modus abspielen' - Durch FastClear
werden die Einzelbilder der Animationen direkt aufeinandergezeichnet,
ohne dazwischen den Bildschirm zu löschen. Das kann auf manchen Karten
einige Flackereffekte verhindern.
     - 'Niedrige Direct3D-Texturdetails' beschleunigt das Spiel, indem
weniger Texturdetails verwendet werden, was natürlich dann in einer
schlechteren Grafik resultiert. Deswegen sollten Sie diese Option nur
dann aktivieren, wenn Sie während das Spiel oft stockt oder langsam
läuft.
     - 'WFOG erzwingen' - WFOG, eine Direct3D-Option, ist eine alter-
native Art, Nebeleffekte anzuzeigen (durch feste Tabellen statt
mit Vektorangaben). Manche Karten unterstützen WFOG nicht korrekt 
(z.B. die S4-Karte), deswegen ist die Option normalerweise deaktiviert.
Sie können aber gerne damit experimentieren.
     - 'Direct3D ZBuffer Bias deaktivieren' - Wenn Sie Direct3D
verwenden und Probleme beim Rendern der Geschwader-Logos sehen (die 
Logos überdecken alles andere), sollte diese Option den Fehler beheben.

3405, "(fr)
  * Audio - FreeSpace 2 unterstützt DirectSound, A3D und EAX. Sie können
einen dieser Standards auswählen, nachdem Sie auf 'Verfügbare Soundkarten
suchen' klicken und dann die gewünschte Soundkarte in der Liste
aussuchen. Ausserdem können Sie die Soundeffekte des Launchers hier ein-
und ausschalten.

  * Joystick - Hier können Sie Ihren Joystick für FreeSpace 2 einstellen.
Wenn Ihr Joystick Force Feedback unterstützt, kompatibel zu DirectX 6.0,
können Sie diese Option hier aktivieren.

  * Geschwindigkeit - Hier stellen Sie die Detailoptionen
für neue Piloten ein. Wir möchten darauf hinweisen, dass die 
Spielgeschwindigkeit deutlich beeinträchtigt werden kann, wenn Sie
diese Option höher als empfohlen setzen.

  * Netzwerk - Hier stellen Sie die Eigenschaften Ihrer Netzwerkhardware
ein, wie Geschwindigkeit und Art der Internetverbindung (falls
vorhanden). Sie können ausserdem hier Ihr PXO-Login eingeben, falls Sie 
sich bei diesem Internetservice eingetragen haben, oder einen
anderen Port erzwingen (Standard: 7808). Die 'PXO Banner' beziehen sich
auf den PXO-Chatscreen und zeigen, wenn aktiviert, Banner von guten
FreeSpace 2-Webseiten an.

  * DirectX - Hier wird Ihre DirectX-Version getestet. Es wird Ihnen
auch die Möglichkeit geboten, von hier aus DirectX zu installieren oder
zu aktualisieren.

  * Sonstiges - Hier können Sie sich noch die Sprache für das Spiel 
aussuchen. Einen Überblick über die möglichen Startparameter, die Sie 
in der Befehlszeile eingeben können, finden Sie in der README.TXT-Datei.
