Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

5401, "Vasudan update:


What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.  Although there has been some minority Vasudan resistance regarding the continuance of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, for the most part, our two species have formed a solid partnership."

5402, "Terran Update:

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''  While most of these factions are insignificant, GTA Command believes that one group, Humans Against Reckless Colonization (HARC) has placed several anonymous GTA officers on its payroll.  Any suspicious activities or persons should be reported to GTA Command."

Your position: Outpost Traffic Controller

The following information is restricted to pilots who possess a Class 2 or above security rating."

5406, "Security 2"

5407, "Although our two fighters should be more than enough today, we have equipped your patrol craft with Avenger cannons and MX-50's in order to comply with the GTAC Section V Article 4450's minimum security requirements for outposts.  We do not expect you to use them."

5408, "Because we had to remove your disruptors, engine disablement will be performed remotely by Flagstaff.  If you find any craft moving in excess of 30m/s, close  to 150 meters, scan the craft and the craft will automatically be locked down and cited."

5412, "Flagstaff authorities and GTA Command are conducting a joint investigation to determine the identity of both the Cruiser pilots and the fighters who attacked you.  Although Flagstaff's remote disruptors were unable to lock down the ship, your heroic feat of scanning a hostile warship is to be commended."

5413, "Flagstaff mourns the loss of three of its pilots.  Apparently, crafts scheduled to fly today were sabotaged before lift-off.  The traitors weren't counting on any resistance.  That you were able to single-handedly take down trained GTA fighter pilots is a truly awesome task.  Excellent work patrolman!"

5414, "Delta wing arrived too late to disable the Cruiser.  Apparently, the order from GTA Command to relocate our fighters was a setup.  Although the order was authenticated, Delta wing traveled two systems to escort a transport which never arrived.  The events which transpired today were carefully planned and executed by individuals highly seated within GTA Command."

5415, "Even though our disruptor system probably wouldn't have been able to stop the Cruiser, it would have been nice if you have made an effort to do so."

5416, "Scanning a hostile Cruiser can be tricky.  Try transferring all of your shield energy forward and making the scan in one pass.  Bob and weave slightly as you come in and save your afterburner for a quick retreat."

5417, "You were unable to issue a citation to all of the speeding craft in the area today.  Even though this seems insignificant in light of today's events, detaining  speeding craft in Outpost ''slow-zones'' is a serious duty as well.  Any may we remind you, YOUR duty."

First mission in your tour aboard the GTD Nepenthe."

5447, "GTA Update:

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

5448, "Colonization Update

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies and defense for our frontier colonization efforts is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

5449, "At a recent press conference, Brian Giordino, president of HARC, issued the following statement, ''Although HARC despises the GTA's lust for universal domination and its tyranny over other alien cultures, we would never attempt to halt this evil with the blood of young Terran pilots.''"

5450, "EMAIL
To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5451, "Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

5452, "Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destiny on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space.  Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy.  Omega One contains a drone pilot and no passengers.."

5454, "Omega 3"

5456, "Beta Cygni Jump Node"

5457, "Unfortunately, due to these safety precautions, GTA ships traveling to the Destiny from Beta Cygni require an escort to the safety perimeter.  Alpha wing will escort Omega to the Destiny.  Once the transports have reached the safe zone, oversee their docking operations and then return to the GTD Nepenthe."

5458, "GTSG Cerberus 33"

5459, "The Destiny's fighters have been working back-breaking shifts since the rise of the mercenary rebellion.  Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

5460, "If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

5461, "Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

5462, "Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

5463, "Things got pretty rough out there.  You are to be commended for bringing your entire team back alive."

5464, "Although Delta wing really needed the rest, it is understandable that you called for reinforcements in the face of considerable opposition."

5465, "Try to complete the mission without calling for Delta wing."

5466, "The pilots on the GTD Destiny wish to thank you for handling the assignment without calling for them.  These weary pilots needed the rest badly."

5467, "We realize that things got pretty rough out there.  However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive.  With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

5468, "Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5469, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5470, "The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

5471, "Ultimately, this mission is a failure.  The personnel on board the Omega transports were the foremost experts on colonization science and technology.  Without them, we have little chance of successfully colonizing the new frontier planets."

5472, "The greatest threat to the Omega transport's is the wing of Athena bombers.  You may want to divide your wing and send some of Alpha to take the fighters, but make sure someone is taking care of those bombers."

The Vasudan fleet is mobilizing in Manda to begin colonization of Mandala Prime.  Colonization will begin tomorrow at 0700 hours."

5650, "The rogue destroyer, the GTD Nepenthe has managed to evade the GTA.  Apparently, the Destroyer and her crew attacked a Vasudan science vessel which was studying the effects of asteroids on radio transmissions.  This outrageous slaughter has enraged Vasudans and Terrans alike."

5651, "Health and Science:

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communication station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus.  The outpost has been shut down and all transmission from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destiny."

5652, "As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a ''virus outbreak''.  We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command.  A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

5653, "Alexander Bell"

5654, "The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters.  Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

5655, "We know the workers on the outpost are not suffering from a virus.  We believe that the Admiral has reconfigured the radar dish so that the Bell cannot communicate.
Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

5656, "Our long range scans indicate that a their is some sort remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar.  Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell.  Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

5657, "I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

5661, "Despite overwhelming odds, the Nepenthe survived the battle intact.  We owe this to the brave pilots who protected our ship in the face of certain death."

5662, "The GTD Nepenthe did not survive the operation.  Our beloved crew and captain will be sorely missed."

5663, "Make sure you protect the Nepenthe from the bomber wing, and work quickly to take out the dish once the shield is down."

This ship and its brave crew managed to unravel a conspiracy which stemmed from one of the highest ranked officers in the GTA Navy, Admiral Darcy.  Commendations to the fine men and women aboard the Alexander Bell who conducted the investigation with the Nepenthe.  Further, the GTA forgives their capital-ship killing special ops. unit for going AWOL.

Apparently, the Vasudan empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA, and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime.  Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded.  The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destiny has already begun evacuation."

5716, "Mandala Prime:

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

5717, "War:

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

Protect the Destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

5728, "Congratulations, pilot.  You accomplished your goals and managed to survive one of the most deadly engagements in the history of Terran Galactic War.  Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

Fortunatly due to your efforts the Elysium was not lost in vein. With the destruction of the Death Storm the Shivan attacks in this area appear to have dropped to almost non existant levels. Well Done."

With the destuction of the the GTD Prometheus, the Shivan threat in this area appears to be on the increase. The loss of the Prometheus will be greatly mourned.
