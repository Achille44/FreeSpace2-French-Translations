Ici l'Amiral Richard Cole, commandant du GTD Warlock, vaisseau amiral de la 7ème flotte. Pour tous les pilotes de remplacement qui embarquent, je vous souhaite la bienvenue.

Vous rejoignez certains des meilleurs éléments de l'Alliance Vasudo-Terrienne Galactique dans notre équipage de 10 000 personnes. Avec plus de 120 vaisseaux de combat, le Warlock abrite un total de quatre escadrons."

4631, "La Situation Shivienne

Cela fait plus de quatre ans que les Shiviens ont détruit l'étoile de Capella. Notre ennemi juré de la Grande Guerre, que l'on croyait contenu dans le système Gamma Draconis, ne l'était pas. Les forces shiviennes ont envahi les systèmes alliés au cours des dernières 48 heures. Nous avons perdu le GTD Reno, le GVC Qu-eth, et le GTC Calhoun. Le Commandement estime les pertes à plus de 100 000 vies."

4632, "Objectifs des Alliés

Le Commandement Allié a ordonné au GTD Warlock et à la 7ème flotte de se rendre dans le système Régulus. Les Shiviens ont mené une attaque soutenue et coordonnée contre les vaisseaux et les installations terriennes et vasudiennes.

Les services de renseignements soupçonnent les Shiviens d'entrer dans le système Régulus par un point de saut inconnu. Les deux nœuds de Polaris et Sirius sont sous étroite surveillance. Un de nos objectifs est de trouver le point d'entrée des Shiviens."

4633, "L'État de l'Alliance

L'Alliance, malgré de nombreuses répressions des activités pirates, reste instable. Au cours des quatre années qui se sont écoulées depuis la Deuxième Incursion Shivienne, notre Alliance a eu du mal à tenir le coup.

Nous avons perdu la majorité de notre flotte à Capella et nous luttons pour nous reconstruire depuis. Il est impératif que nous évacuions autant de civils et de militaires que possible, aussi vite que possible. Nous ne serons peut-être pas en mesure de résister à un autre assaut shivien."

4634, "L'État de l'Alliance (Suite)

Le projet de Knossos de Sol est bien avancé, chaque entrepreneur de l'Alliance contribuant à sa construction. Avec cette nouvelle menace à Régulus, le Commandement a ordonné que l'activation du Knossos de Sol soit suspendue jusqu'à ce que la situation puisse être résolue.

Si nous ne parvenons pas à stopper l'avancée des Shiviens, nous ne pouvons qu'espérer que l'humanité soit en sécurité dans le système Sol."

4645, "Bon travail, pilote. Je suis impressionné par vos capacités.

La base de données de l'ordinateur du Disen a révélé peu d'informations. Les données qu'il y avait ont été classifiées sur la base du besoin d'en connaitre, ce qui suggère que quoi que ce soit, c'est important.

La présence shivienne est en augmentation dans ce secteur. Vous et votre escadrille faites honneur à l'Alliance."

We have lost Régulus to the Shivans. Allied Command is devising a counter-offensive operation, but it appears that even holding Sirius against the Shivans may be more than we're capable of.

I've recommended your transfer to the 108th Wraiths, one of the tactical bombing squadrons onboard the Warlock. I'm sure you'll serve them well."

After a successful delaying action in Régulus, the majority of the Shivan force has only entered Sirius in the last 8 hours. Since then, they have engaged all Allied warships in the system.

The GTC Repherus and the GTCv Erikson have already been destroyed in the Shivan onslaught and we aren't expecting the invasion to stop now."

If we fail to stop the Shivans here, they will have access to most of the core Allied worlds. Billions call Sirius home and we don't have the time to evacuate them all, despite our best efforts.

The GTVA 6th Fleet is en route to the Régulus system to reinforce Allied lines, but both the 12th Vasudan Battlegroup and the 7th Fleet have sustained heavy casualties.

4883, "(fr)Shivan forces have been hitting Allied positions around the clock since they entered the system. In particular, Shivan forces have attacked Allied positions on the surface of Sirius III. Most of the orbital guns have been destroyed, and the fleet is in a shambles. This is unusual behavior for the Shivans. However, we've come to expect virtually anything from them."

The Équinoxe is part of the Warlock's primary escort and is a very valuable ship. Other Allied capital ships may be committed to the battle should they become available."

4891, "Corvette Shivienne"

4892, "(fr)Once the depot is destroyed, we can expect Shivan forces to move in on your position. Destroy as many of them as you can. Command will inform you when it's time to retreat. That is all, pilot."

4893, "(fr)You did a good job pilot. All Shivan targets were destroyed and your efforts seriously weakened the Shivan offense in Sirius.

Allied forces have now taken position orbiting the planet and have repelled several initial attack waves. The Shivan destroyer Revial continues to bombard the planet.

This mission was a lot more intense than expected and you and your wingmen performed admirably. Well done."

In addition, the crew of the GTC Nicolas extends their thanks. While your mission objective was to protect the convoy, it is a testament to the skill and resourcefulness of you and your wing that you were able to preserve the convoy intact and come to the aid of a warship in distress. Well done!

Tomorrow's briefing will cover the details of this new system and our objectives in it. Until then, get some rest."

We have entered the Mintaka system beyond the Régulus Knossos portal. What we have encountered is very much like what the 3rd fleet found beyond the original Knossos portal.

The Mintaka system is made up of no less than five stars. Terran scientists were puzzled when one of these stars went supernova 700 years ago, long before than it was expected to perish. Only its core remains intact. The rest of the star became a massive nebula."

5188, "(fr)Resemblance to Capella

If we were to return to Capella the view outside would be very much the same. Perhaps this nebula is the result of the destruction of yet another sun by the Shivan Sathanas fleet hundreds of years ago.

We are to keep on our guard. Should a Sathanas juggernaut be sighted we have orders to destroy the portal and return to GTVA space."

Special Operations Command will be involved in an operation to determine what happened in the Sirius and Régulus systems.

Shivan forces have been retreating from most engagements, although we still face stiff resistance.

Intelligence agents are going to be conducting high priority missions to learn as much as we can about the Shivans and this is the best opportunity we've yet had. Do not disrupt any intelligence gathering operation."

5191, "(fr)Lt. Stavros here. Thanks to the excellent work of the Lonestars, we have now moved the Warlock into the region beyond the portal. Similar to the system beyond the Gamma Draconis portal, this region is a nebula that is several lightyears in size."

5192, "(fr)Because our sensors are limited, we have deployed several wings from the Warlock and Taténen to scout ahead and give us accurate information on the capabilities and numbers of the Shivans. EM interference is not high and we expect that all internal systems will be operating at normal levels."

5198, "(fr)Although the existence of Sathanas debris, compounded by the discovery of further debris, is cause for concern, Allied Command has elected not to pull out of the nebula.

The reasoning behind this decision is unknown, although it appears that somebody at very high levels wants this exploration to continue despite the risks.

Further information on the debris has been classified way beyond my level of clearance."

You've failed your objective to patrol the area ahead of the Warlock. Another scouting party will now be required to accomplish the same tasks. We're wasting manpower and possibly even lives cleaning up after you, pilot."

This ship turns out to be the GTE Vidar. It is a Terran Explorer class vessel, which is very rare. This one seems to have had a total overhaul. Its exact purpose is unknown, and Russik is unwilling to release any details."

5429, "(fr)Excellent work. The GVD Taténen made the jump into Kaus Borealis sucessfully. Without your skillful escort we might have lost that destroyer. The Shivans certainly threw enough at the vessel to seal its fate.

The Shivans are guarding this system exceptionally well, although they do not appear to be in an offensive position. This system doesn't seem too important to the Shivans and Allied Command believes that we should be able to achieve Admiral Russik's objectives in short order.

The Vidar Project was the first project that the then Lieutenant Russik worked on. It was a top secret operation being conducted by the rogue Galactic Terran Intelligence agency back in the era of the GTA. The objective was to meld Terran and Shivan physiology into a hybrid lifeform. The hybrids would then be used in conjunction with experimental Shivan communications technology. We suspect several may have actually been created."

5591, "(fr)The GTE Vidar

The GTE Vidar was the only ship of its class produced. It was designed using the hull of a Terran Explorer class ship, a very rare vessel. The design itself is old, but we can deduce that the ship has been refitted after the defeat of the GTI.

Its exact communications capabilities are unknown. However, it is believed that Admiral Russik integrated an ETAK device into Terran-Shivan genetic hybrids on the ship, potentially giving it an unparalleled ability to communicate with the Shivans."

5592, "(fr)Objectives

Our mission is clear. We must hunt down Admiral Russik and capture or destroy the Vidar before it can be used. The potential for such a technology is terrifying.

We have blockaded both jump nodes in the Kaus Borealis system and our intelligence personnel are attempting to deduce the Admiral's position.

We must accomplish our objective or we will be forced to shut down the Knossos portal in Régulus and abandon these systems. We cannot afford the risk of allowing another rogue Admiral to collaborate with the Shivans at our doorstep."

5593, "(fr)636th Wolfpack Squadron

Due to your exemplary record and your time aboard the GVD Taténen, Command has decided that you be promoted as the squadron commander for the elite 636th Wolfpack squadron.

You will receive all your briefings from the quarterdeck. Because of your elite status, you will be called upon to perform the more hazardous and sensitive missions and you will have access to the most advanced technology available aboard the Warlock."

5594, "(fr)Admiral Russik has been formally charged with treason, conspiracy, and a multitude of other less serious crimes against the GTVA. We have orders to recapture the Vidar and capture or destroy the Kirosi and Admiral Russik. "

5595, "(fr)Intelligence has informed us that Russik is moving to a more secure position within the Kaus Borealis system. In order to reach this location, he will make several smaller jumps across the system. We will intercept him at one of these predicted locations."

5596, "(fr)A Leviathan class cruiser, the Castigar, is the front runner for Russik's small taskforce. The 636th will intercept the Castigar and disable its communications and engine subsystems. Try to do as little damage as possible - Stiletto II missiles or Disruptors are recommended."

5597, "Castigar"

5598, "(fr)It is imperative that the Castigar is not destroyed. We'd like to minimize casualties and capture Russik and his conspirators alive. If the communications and engines are not brought down in under 3 minutes, the Castigar will be in a position to warn the Kirosi of our ambush."

5599, "(fr)Once the Kirosi and the Vidar have entered the area we will deploy the GTD Warlock to resolve the situation. We are looking for Admiral Russik to stand down and surrender - but be prepared if the situation dictates more extreme actions. Zeta wing's Boanerges bombers will be deployed if necessary. You're flying this mission because you're resourceful and talented. Do what you have to do, pilots."

5600, "(fr)Good work disabling the communication and engine systems on the Castigar. Reports are that your team pulled off that part of the operation with exceptional skill."

5601, "(fr)The ambush went well. The Kirosi has been destroyed and the rest of Russik's fleet has been hunted down in other parts of the system and either captured or destroyed.

Unfortunately, the Vidar and Admiral Russik slipped through our fingers and have escaped to the Gienah Cygni jump node. We will be pursuing them into that system shortly."

5602, "(fr)You failed to eliminate the engines and communications system on the Castigar in time. Admiral Russik learned of the ambush and avoided the situation. This is a totally unacceptable outcome from any GTVA unit. The fact that your elite unit performed below par creates doubts about you and your squadron's capabilities. You are being demoted and removed from active flight status."

5603, "(fr)Disable the Castigar whilst ordering your wingmen to cover you."

5604, "(fr)The ambush failed and Admiral Russik, the Kirosi, and a small battlegroup have escaped the system unscathed. What Admiral Russik plans to do in Gienah Cygni is unknown. We are retreating to GTVA space where we will destroy the jump node to Mintaka, hopefully sealing him beyond reach of GTVA space."

5654, "(fr)Clear out the Shivan jamming station.
"

5655, "(fr)At 1430 hours, the Warlock entered the Gienah Cygni system. Upon entering the system, our long range sensors were jammed. We cannot adequately assess the situation in this system until the jamming ceases."

5656, "(fr)We have managed to track the source of the jamming to a region near a giant gas planet caught in the star's gravitational field. We suspect that a Shivan communications node is responsible for the jamming of our systems, but we cannot be sure."

5657, "(fr)Your squadron will embark on a high-risk operation utilizing the experimental GTF Pegasus stealth fighters. Alpha wing will proceed to the area and assess the situation. Use stealth to your advantage and destroy the source of the jamming. If possible, destroy any other targets of opportunity."

5658, "(fr)Lt. Commander Niven will also be in the area and will direct your actions. Intelligence speculates that Admiral Russik may attempt to communicate with the Shivans. The Vidar and its Terran-Shivan hybrids coupled with integrated ETAK technology may well bridge the communications gap that Admiral Bosch sought to jump. Monitor the situation and record everything."

5659, "(fr)Commander Niven will lead the operation. He has orders regarding every contingency and since you'll be out of communications range until the jamming source is destroyed, you will not have direct contact with Command or a support ship. Good luck, pilots."

5660, "(fr)Excellent work. You and your team successfully completed an operation where most pilots would have perished. You have more than earned your elite squadron status. Be proud of your accomplishments."

5661, "(fr)I'm happy to report that all Shivan forces in the area were destroyed on this sortie. This is a victory well worth noting."

5662, "(fr)You failed to destroy the Shivan communications and jamming device.

It is noted that you did find the location of the jamming device but an elite squadron such as yours is generally expected to perform better under the circumstances."

5663, "(fr)Destroy the jamming station at all costs, but avoid the blast. Stay out of the line of sight of the Shivans to avoid being hit."

5664, "(fr)You failed to destroy all of the Shivan forces you encountered. Your orders included the destruction of targets of opportunity. Pilots such as yourselves should know of the serious breach in our security that has been created now that the Shivans are aware of our capabilities and presence in the system."

5797, "(fr)Pieces of the Puzzle

After hours of intelligence work aboard the GTE Vidar, we have finally uncovered Russik's plan.

Russik believes that a single Terran-Shivan hybrid holds the power to control Shivan ships. This theory is based on the idea that Shivans are controlled by a hive mind."

5798, "(fr)Russik's Plan

Russik not only contacted the Shivans, but he gained control of a small number of their forces using the hybrids in his possession. Intelligence believes that a central communications nexus in the Naos system may hold the key to his power over the Shivans. With Shivan forces under his control, he could take control of the GTVA in a mere matter of months."

5799, "(fr)The Final Attack

Our objectives are simple, if difficult. We must prevent a takeover of the GTVA by eliminating Admiral Russik and preventing the Shivans from attacking our space. If this means destroying him and every Shivan in Naos, so be it.

All squadrons are to report to the briefing room in 10 minutes."

5800, "(fr)This is Admiral Cole.

We've discovered Admiral Russik's location. His transport is in close proximity to the SD Daskha, a Ravana class destroyer. Sensor scans indicate that the destroyer is emitting a high frequency subspace pulse. The purpose of the pulse is unknown but we suspect it is connected to Admiral Russik's control of the Shivans and broader plan."

5802, "(fr)We have no time to spare. We will launch an all-out attack against Admiral Russik and any Shivans that get in our way. Remember, we want Russik alive if possible, so consider his shuttle non-combatant. I will personally lead the Warlock into a direct confrontation with the Daskha. The Warlock will be doing this the old-fashioned way."

5803, "(fr)Wolfpack Squadron, you will lead the way. Eliminate all Shivan fighters, bombers, and assist the Warlock by making surgical strikes against the hostile destroyer. Eliminate beam cannons and maneuvering subsystems."

5804, "Gamma"

5805, "(fr)Once Shivan forces have been eliminated, we will confront Admiral Russik. Justice is served in the courts, not in front of a firing squad. We will bring him in alive and make him pay for his crimes against the Alliance. We'll be with you every step of the way, pilots. Good luck! If we can stop the Admiral here, we can preserve the safety and security of our home systems."

5806, "(fr)Gemini 1 - Admiral Russik"

5807, "(fr)The Shivan destroyer Daskha was destroyed along with most of Admiral Russik's hope of victory in this engagement. Well done. Without your heroic actions disabling the cannons while under heavy fighter attack, the Warlock would not have won the day. You are to be commended for your skill and dedication."

5808, "(fr)Admiral Russik committed suicide by self-destructing his transport. He can no longer be brought to justice and we may never learn how far his conspiracy into the GTVA extends. For now, we can rest a little easier knowing the fact that his plan to control the Shivans failed and that we have secured the GTVA from the threat of Shivan invasion once again. It's finally over - for now."

5809, "(fr)The Warlock survived the engagement and is returning to the Sirius system for repairs. I personally thank you and your squadron for defending my ship from intense enemy attack. Well done!"

5810, "(fr)We've failed in our mission to stop Admiral Russik and save the GTVA from certain attack. We are returning to Régulus, but our sensors are already detecting a massive Shivan buildup."

5811, "(fr)Destroy the Ravana destroyer by eliminating its forward beam cannons."

5812, "(fr)The GTD Warlock was destroyed and all 10,000 on board the vessel were lost. The is a dark day indeed for the Alliance. You are dismissed."

5813, "(fr)Watch for the Seraphim bombers that attack the Warlock, and disable the Daskha's beam cannons. Ensure you dispatch the comm node quickly, and assist in the destruction of the cruisers."

5842, "(fr)Target has suffered a catastrophic hull failure - integrity now below five percent. Destruction is imminent."

5843, "(fr)The Ravana has been eliminated. Well done!"

5844, "(fr)This is the Warlock. Hull integrity has fallen below fifty percent. We need fighter support!"

5845, "(fr)Hull integrity has gone critical. We've lost our subspace drive and the hull is in danger of collapse. All units, protect the Warlock at all costs!"

5846, "(fr)Let's end this. Launching Iota wing bombers to destroy the communications node. Alpha wing, clear out the sentries."

5847, "(fr)Impressive Cole. But I�m afraid I�ve got some more friends to call in."

5848, "(fr)Detecting two Rakshasa-class cruisers, designations Parvati and Ragelam. Fighter escort is present."

5849, "(fr)Re-tasking Iota wing and launching Zeta wing to attack the cruisers. Beta and Gamma, cover our bombers!"

5850, "(fr)The Parvati and the Ragelam have been eliminated!"

5851, "(fr)Admiral Russik, this is Admiral Cole. You have 30 seconds to surrender."

5852, "(fr)Surrendering now. Admiral Cole, just remember that it all ends in fire."

5853, "(fr)It all ends in fire? ...Wait... No! Russik! Don't..."

5854, "(fr)Sensors indicating a power flux on Russik's transport. He's activated the self destruct system!"

5855, "(fr)Pilots, Admiral Russik is dead. His quest for power is over, and the rogue GTI hybrids are destroyed."

5856, "(fr)Mission failed! All units, abort your attack. We're uploading escape coordinates - jump out now!"

5857, "(fr)Reading another subspace pulse. It's not coming from the destroyer, it's coming from that communications node!"

5858, "(fr)The communications node is breaking up. All forces stand clear - we're reading a large energy spike!"

5859, "(fr)I'm impressed, Cole, I didn't think you would make it this far. After all, you were only second in your graduating command class. Let's see how you deal with this challenge."

5860, "(fr)Another subspace pulse! Alpha, you didn't destroy that node in time. We're detecting incoming Shivan capital ship jump signatures!"

5861, "(fr)The Warlock cannot survive another engagement with a capital ship. All units, prepare to depart. We will upload escape coordinates momentarily."

5862, "(fr)Alpha wing, you must destroy the communications node before Russik can summon additional Shivan reinforcements. Intelligence estimates you have less than two minutes."

5863, "(fr)What the...? That looks like..."

5864, "(fr)All units, secure the area, then return to the Warlock's fighterbay. Well done, people."

5865, "(fr)Russik may be trying to call in more Shivans, but we have very little information about that device or its capabilities. Destroy the Ravana - then we'll deal with the node."

5866, "(fr)Alpha, intelligence estimates that you have less than 60 seconds until Russik can use the communications node. Target the core subsystem and destroy it immediately!"

5867, "(fr)We're detecting a power surge in the Daskha's forward beam cannons!"
