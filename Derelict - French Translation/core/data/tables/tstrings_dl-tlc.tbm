The D.H. variant is faster and more maneuverable than the standard Artemis bomber, at no cost to armor or armament. During the OpEval period, Artemis D.H. bombers are being deployed in only select squadrons in different theatres of the war.

Five years have passed since the jump nodes to the Capella system were collapsed, sealing off a massive wave of Shivan juggernaughts and preventing them from pushing further into GTVA space. The supernova and subsequent nebula hang like a growing scar throughout the GTVA as light from that event continues to spread across our worlds."

The loss of Capella created serious economic hardship throughout the Alliance - a new Great Depression is upon us. The complete loss of the planetary resources and economic foundation of a rich world was devastating in its own right, but that is not all. Two hundred million refugees continue to walk the stars, seeking a new home. Some have settled, while others have been forced to move from place to place, hoping that the next place may welcome them with open arms."

While the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance continues to hold, the current depression has given way to political instability. Local governments rise and fall as often as lunar tides, organized crime and piracy have prospered in a black market environment. It seems no one is immune. Radical voices are raising echoes not heard since the blood cries of the Neo-Terran Front. The ghosts of the past are catching up with us."

Since collapsing the Capella jump nodes, the recovering GTVA fleets have spent much of their time and resources in police actions.

Even so, it is alarming that there are those who are starting to take matters into their own hands."

Fortnight Update

I trust you are settling in well, pilot, now that you have been with us for more than two weeks. To be honest, aside from the recent excitement with the Blackbeard pirate raid near the Station, not much else happens out here. You're about to get a taste of the less exciting parts of life in the boondocks. Unfortunately, I am not much for motivational speeches, especially when we have work that needs to be done. 

Welcome to Deep Patrol duty. You can thank me later."

While Tau Sigma has been settled as a mining colony for over fifteen years, very little of the system has been marked for navigation. As a result, there are many hazardous regions of the star system that require navigational beacons, to ensure safe passage in these areas. Until now, only a small number of beacons have been set around the system. They mark the critical commercial lanes, particularly near the mining operations. However, GTVA Command informs us that in the coming months, the traffic to Tau Sigma will increase significantly. There is a need to step up the schedule of navigational beacon deployment.

Report to briefing for your specific assignment."

Your $b Myrmidon fighters are being modified to carry several of these beacons. They will become available to deploy under your control when you reach the designated area for that marker. In order to make room to carry these navigation beacons, your primary weapons have been limited, and your secondary banks have been reduced in capacity."

4576, "Due to the length of this mission, you and your wingmates will be flying in shifts. You will take turns sleeping as you make your patrol rounds. While asleep, your navigation systems will be locked into your wingmates'. In the event of any danger, you will be automatically alerted, and your systems brought online."

4577, "Each fighter wing has been assigned to lay markers in three different locations in the star system. $f Alpha, your task is simple. In each designated area, you are to make a clean sweep, noting any hazards, and dropping the navigational beacons in their appropriate area. Your onboard computer will automatically determine the best location for deployment, marking it with a $b computer-generated $b Pharos beacons on your HUD."

Once this is all over, we hope to make $b Tau $b Sigma much more accessible to those wishing to develop this region. "

4581, "On the first leg of your patrol, you will be placing beacons near an ice-belt further out of system. If we are lucky, these beacons may be able to use the reflective surfaces of the ice-belt to amplify their own scanning range. Once you successfully place the beacons, your computer will automatically download the next stage of your mission. Despite your remote location, you are still well within communication range of $f Tau $f Sigma $f Station. $g Command will be monitoring your progress.

Now, down to business... We seem to have encountered a situation at your next destination. Two Morgan Mining freighters have jumped in too close to the asteroid field you're about to mark. Lack of navigational data is proving to be a liability.

They have also picked up some transmissions from within the belt - it seems like you're flying into a pirate ambush. Be on your guard. While you will still lay the navigational buoys, your first task will be to guard the freighters by elminating any pirates, and  clearing a path for them through the asteroid field.

Presently, $f Alpha wing is flying close escort to the $b TRGS $b Meridian and the $b TRGF $b Haulian. You are flying in the subspace corridor between the $b Tau $b Sigma and $b Altair jump nodes."

4927, "Tau Sigma"

4928, "At present, there is no sign of the pirate craft, designated $h Long $h John wing.  We know these to be eight $b Ares class fighters. They are more heavily armed than your $b Myrmidons. However, we expect them to be carrying armament intended for disabling ships. This may be to your advantage, but don't count on it. 

Remember that in subspace, your shields will not work. The only benefit in this situation is that neither will theirs. "

4929, "Long John"

4930, "Because of their six forward gun mounts and heavier armor, it is recommended that you avoid attacking $h Long $h John wing head on. To aid you, we have dispatched the $f GTS $f Servicor to reload your weapons. The $f Servicor is carrying additional missile supplies, so you may change your missile configuration if you so desire.  "

4941, "Good work in overseeing the repair operation to the Meridian. The crew of the Isiroth  were able to repair the engines without too much difficulty. "

4942, "It seems that your wing was also the target of the subspace raid. It appears that the pirates intended to destroy two of your craft, and disable the other two. It seems their intention was to use Alpha 2 and 4 as cover for their escape from subspace."

5012, "Personal Log: Governor Raymond Francis M'kembe
Date: November 13, 2372

It has been just over five years since the largest exodus humanity has ever seen. Towards the end of the Neo-Terran Front rebellion, an ancient portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system. It had been activated by the NTF, opening the doorway to another confrontation with the Shivans. 

In our arrogance, we thought we had learned from our experience thirty-two years ago. Nietzche once said, 'That which does not kill us, makes us  stronger.' We believed him. Our trust in our technology and our alliances made us overconfident. We assumed we could overcome any obstacle, and that nothing could stand in our way. When the Shivans came again, we thought, like Jerusalem of old, that our walls would never fall."

5013, "But the prophets cried out, warning of doom on the horizon. We ignored them, believing the lie that we had made for ourselves. The lesson, like the universe, was harsh, and we had forgotten it. We forgot that we had paid the price with our homeworlds. We were cut off from Sol and Earth, Vasuda Prime had been laid waste. Scattered across many systems, our colonies became our havens, because we had little choice. Terran, Vasudan, we walk amongst the cold space between the stars as exiles, looking for a place where we might find comfort, and most of all home."

5014, "We learned the lesson again with Capella, a place I once called home. When the Shivans came again, we fled our homes with a hope that we could soon return. We hoped that the GTVA would stop them. Yet after a short-lived victory, we saw our place in the universe. The Shivans tore through our defenses as if they were paper, batting us aside as if we were nothing but a minor annoyance. In efforts to save the rest of our colonies, the jump nodes were collapsed, and the Shivan advance stopped at Capella. 

Yet I am left to wonder. I look at the starfield from here at Altair, looking at the golden glow of the star I was born under. Yet I know this to be an illusion, this system will not see the supernova that destroyed our home for many years to come. It is a reminder of a place to which we can never return. We are exiles once again."

5015, "In all, there were some two hundred million of us cast out of Eden to walk amongst the stars. We look for a place to call home. Many resent us, because the strain on the GTVA economy has thrown us into a new depression. The Vasudans have been kind, showing us a hospitality that we never expected. The wounds of the Terran-Vasudan War still run deep, it has been heartening to discover, however, their honour and their trust. Yet perhaps they have more in common than we once thought, for they too are exiles, having a deeper understanding of what it is to never return home. 

This is why we come to Altair, the doorway to a new promised land. The systems beyond show great promise and hope of a new found freedom for our people. For the first time in many, many years, I feel hope for our future.

Additionally, the docking bays of the GVI Luxor were sabotaged by a substantial explosion. In doing so, the Governor's Shuttle was stranded outside the station during the firefight, leaving it vulnerable to a kidnap attempt.

It seems that Kappa wing had access to GTVA clearance codes in the system. This is a serious breach of security. Their IFF appeared as friendly so that they could approach the convoy unmolested.

We were fortunate that the GTFf Cypher was in the area, and helped drive off this pirate attack. However, details of their presence in the system is classified. You are not to discuss this matter, even amongst your wingmates."

5039, "Unfortunately, the food convoy fell under attack on the way to their station. The loss of this part of the convoy is serious enough that we will have to look at alternative means of feeding the Capellan Refugees."

5040, "The GTM Alexis was destroyed enroute to Luxor Station. We are more than disappointed, pilot. Over 3,000 lives were lost when she went up. This will be reflected on your permanent record. "

5041, "The GTM Alexis successfully made it to her rendezvous point. As flagship of the Capellan flotilla, she will hold position at Luxor Station to supervise the operation. Hopefully, the quarantine of the jump node will be short lived, and the Capellans will be able to establish a new home. "

The Berkeley reported that it was under attack from a Deimos-class corvette. Based on this data and the events of the past four days, we must assume this to be the Ithaca. The Ithaca destroyed the Berkeley at 1052 hours."

5143, "Security Risk

The threat the Ithaca poses is extreme. We cannot ignore it, nor can we wait for GTVA fleet assets to reinforce us. By that time the Ithaca may have moved on. We must deal with the Ithaca at once.

Unfortunately, the GVCv Qualmotep was severely damaged in its last engagement. Despite repairs, it is still not fit for battle. The Qualmotep will have to fight at long range, if at all. Still, at this point we have little choice."

5144, "Terran Fighter Repairs

Regrettably, we have been unable to repair the damage which your Myrmidon fighters sustained during the engagement in the Altair-Tau Sigma jump corridor. We lack the parts required for a full refit of a Terran fighter. The Myrmidons will never fly again.

You will have to make use of the Vasudan fighters which we have available. Fortunately, we have enough spare fighters for you to use and some fighters modified for Terran use. Get used to them, you may not be flying Terran issues for a while to come.

Report to mission briefing on the double, pilots."

5145, "As you are all well aware, the $h Ithaca must be dealt with immediately.  Latest data shows it to be seeking refuge in the $b Casa $b Belt. The belt's composition prevents sensors from penetrating it. We believe that the $h Ithaca is making repairs within the belt."

5146, "Because of its intelligence value alone, we must attempt to capture the $h Ithaca.This will also eliminate the threat posed by the vessel without having the $f Qualmotep engage it in direct combat."

5147, "$f Alpha wing, flying $b Horus fighters, will be integral to this mission's success. You must plant a $b TAG guidance beacon on the $h Ithaca's hull.

The weapons will only have enough energy for a few shots, so the $f Qualmotep may need your help to disable the $h Ithaca. For this reason the $b Akheton $b SDG disruptor cannon has been made available to you, if you wish to use it. However, you will be required to modify your loadout if you wish to use this weapon. You may vary your loadout if you wish, though the $b TAG missiles will be required for the mission. The $f GVA $f Neith will be providing a sensor scrambler field to prevent the detection of the $f Qualmotep by the $r mercenaries. $f Alpha wing will then deal with the defending fighters."

The mercenary vessel will be in no shape to put up a fight, so hopefully they'll surrender peacefully. If they do not, $f Alpha wing will disarm them as well. When we have the $h Ithaca's crew, you will be authorised to depart.

Good hunting, $f Alpha."

5152, "The apparent self-immolation of the crew of the Ithaca cannot be readily explained, especially considering their last words. It appears that they were as taken by surprise as we were. We suspect that the destruction of the Ithaca was linked to the unusual sensor readings recorded by Alpha 2 just prior to the explosion. The sensor data is under analysis now.

The crew of the GVT Isiroth were killed in action. However, their honourable death was not entirely in vain, for we have at least removed the threat the Ithaca posed."

5153, "Alpha wing, with the tools available to you the task you were given should not have been difficult. Your failure to provide fire support for the Qualmotep and disable the Ithaca has resulted in it's disappearance, for the second time. We have been unable to track the vessel, though we have received reports that another Capellan food convoy was hit by the Ithaca at 0315 hours."

5154, "The mercenary wings which threatened us were all destroyed by you and your wings. For this you are to be commended. In the fight against pirates and mercenaries, we need to retain the upper hand."

5155, "Your failure to destroy the mercenary attack wings pales in comparison to the loss of life we have seen today. In the constant battle against criminal elements we must always attempt to turn the odds in our favour."

5156, "The identity and allegiance of the unidentified Faustus-class science vessel sighted near the Ithaca immediately prior to the explosion remains unknown. Our pilots were unable to gain sensor lock. We're looking into this vessel's origin and motives but we have little to go on. It seems that there may be more powerful forces at work here than we could previously have imagined."

SOC Reassignment

Welcome to Special Operations Command, pilots. This is Jonas Ekestam, captain of the GTCv Escher. Not many are recruited into our ranks, but when they are, they are pilots of the highest calibre. After your performance defending the Escher from pirates, as well as excellent performance in several other missions, we have decided that those pilots who flew Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 in previous missions will fill the gaps in our deep cover team."

5286, "Deep Cover Brief

Deep cover missions are carried out behind enemy lines with little or no logistical support. You've got to be tough to make it through a mission like this, but we're sure you'll be able to manage."

5287, "Tau Sigma Mercenaries

The subject of this operation is the mercenary group operating out of Tau Sigma - also active in Altair - that we believe are responsible for numerous attacks on GTVA targets. We must discover to whom these mercenaries report, and who has been leaking them and other groups sensitive information about GTVA ship movements."

5288, "Undercover Contact

Your contact on this mission will be Lieutenant Tom Faulkner. Faulkner infiltrated the mercenary group five weeks ago and has been investigating ever since. He'll teach you all you need to know about deep cover ops."

5289, "Rendezvous with Mercenaries

The SOC have certain privileges and the Escher is able to travel through the subspace corridor to Tau Sigma despite the blockade. We'll be dropping you off at a rendezvous point in Altair before travelling on to Tau Sigma Station, where we have some supplies to deliver."

5290, "Denial of Knowledge

Good luck, pilots. This will be a difficult assignment, but I'm sure we have the right pilots for the job. Remember that if you are uncovered, the SOC will disavow all knowledge of your assignment. Agents are provided with cyanide capsules for a reason. I'm sure I needn't spell it out."

5291, "Good morning, pilots. I'm Lieutenant Tom Faulkner, your contact inside the $b mercenary $b group for the duration of this operation. Our principal objective here is to discover to whom these mercs report, and who has been supplying them with sensitive information about $g GTVA movements. We have you a fairly routine job today. We are to guard a cargo depot belonging to our mysterious employer."

However, larger companies such as Morgan have quite a stranglehold on the local mining market. You'll be pleased to hear that we did get a small bonus for our effort."

So assist them in covering the freighters while they collect the cargo and depart.

The convoy we are attacking is not a genuine $g GTVA convoy - it's a mock-up created by $g GTVI in order to give us the opportunity to gain the trust of the $b mercenaries. However, the cargo is real, as is the threat of $r raiders. The convoy is also armed. This is in order to create the illusion that it is real. However, the armaments on the fighters are considerably below the norm. It will also still jump to $f Luxor $f Station if we fail to intercept it.

Needless to say, you do NOT tell anyone this. Do so and our cover's blown for sure. I'm not sure how the mercs would react, but suffice it to say that swallowing that cyanide capsule would probably be a more comfortable death. Now get down to the fighter bays, they're waiting for us."

Thankfully no GTVA personnel lost their lives on the vessels and the mercenaries did not catch onto our ruse.  "

The mercenaries are dissapointed with us, and so am I. I thought that pilots recruited to the SOC were of the highest quality. Looks like I was wrong."

Most of the research data from the Nyarlathotep was saved and we have invaluable eyewitness accounts of the attack. When the Escher neared the Nyarlathotep, they did not discover any hostile craft or tampering with the Shivan vessel of any kind, but all other friendly craft had been annhilated."

More distressingly, the Escher was to be key in bringing the Nyarlathotep out of the node and into GTVA hands. Furthermore, the corvette was also to have had a role in defusing a situation at Tau Sigma Station, the soon-to-be home of the Shivan derelict. With the loss of the Escher, a new corvette not burdened by other duties will have to be found - a process that could take weeks, if not months."

-- Revelation 13:18

It is amazing how many times throughout history people have used this passage to point out evil somewhere else. The great doomsayers of the late 20th Century turned this into an ill-conceived art. John of Patmos was not writing in some kind of mystical code pointing to some obscure figure in the future, but to the reality of evil in our midst. Through metaphor and imagery, John pulled back the curtain of reality to look at ourselves more deeply. Yet we have always wanted to put the blame elsewhere. The Shivans or the Vasudans have been an unfortunate convenience for our darker nature. In looking somewhere else, we don't realize what we ourselves are capable of...

5693, "Captain Ekestam of the GTCv Escher here. Welcome back to the $b Tau $b Sigma mining colonies, pilot. The $g GTVA has decided to reopen the jump corridor. Unfortunately, your return will not be as warmly received as it was the first time. In the three weeks since the $b Tau $b Sigma-Altair jump corridor was quarantined, supplies have not been getting through to the station. While there is another jump corridor into the region, it is far less stable and requires travel through the uncontrolled systems beyond $b Regulus.

As a result, the residents have been cut off without much more than emergency supplies, and $b Tau $b Sigma is now in a state of unrest."

5694, "Several hours ago, at 0745, workers on board the station commandeered the $b TRGC $b Sai and the $f GTC $f LoneWolf. They, along with a group of freighters, gas miners, and other cargo ships have formed a blockade in protest of the $g GTVA's closure of the jump corridor. At this time, we do not know their demands. Since their original move, all communication with $b Tau $b Sigma has been cut off. "

We have little choice but to move the $r Shivan derelict out of the node and into the $b Tau $b Sigma system within the next several hours. If we do not, the corridor will become too unstable to support the flood of $g Capellan refugees now gathering in $b Altair."

5698, "$f Alpha wing, you will be flying escort to the $f GTCv $f Escher as we arrive in system to help calm the protest. We know there are mercenaries and pirates in system that may be a part of the blockade. The $f Escher may need fighter cover if things turn ugly.

Report for launch."

5699, "Welcome back to Tau Sigma Station, pilot.

The most difficult thing in any riot, is being able to focus on doing one thing well in the middle of chaos. With all that has happened, we are still picking up the pieces. However, as near as we can discern, this is what happened."

5700, "The arrival of the SD Nyarlathotep sent a wave of panic throughout the protest crowd. This wasn't unexpected, but we had hoped to clear the area before the superdestroyer was brought out of subspace.

It seems the crew of the Clement were experienced enough with the main guns of the Fenris cruiser, that they panicked and began firing on the Nyarlathotep. Failing reason, the Escher ordered you to destroy the forward beam cannon of the Clement, which you did quickly and efficiently."

5701, "It seems that while this was a protest on the part of union workers in the region, some of the cruisers, including the Cassius, the Nero, and the Gas Miner Brutus were hired union busters. It seems that they were intending to instigate a riot all along, hopefully killing Adam Tarovich in the melee."

5702, "Excellent job in protecting the Sai in the middle of that firefight. You managed to focus well in the midst of a very chaotic situation. Even though in custody, Mr. Tarovich is grateful for your efforts in warding off attacks during the riot."

5703, "Unfortunately, the Sai was destroyed in the riot, and Adam Tarovich along with her. This situation is getting out of hand. It is not a loss that we can accept."

5704, "The Sai is the primary target of the bombers. Be sure to concentrate on intercepting their attack run."

5705, "The Nero and all of her crew were unexpectedly destroyed by a stray beam from the SD Nyarlathotep. We are unclear if the Nero was deliberately firing on the the SuperDestroyer, or if they were simply missing the Sai. Regardless, the Nyarlathotep's defensive systems roared to life, destroying the Nero almost instantly.

We are taking extra precautions as the Nyarlathotep is being placed into docking rings near Tau Sigma Station. We do not want to risk reactivating her automated defenses. The science team on board is working overtime to determine what happened."

5706, "This was a difficult environment to fly in, Pilot. Riots are perhaps the worst kinds of engagements to be in. Innocent people always get hurt, and no one wins. It is now of paramount importance that we secure the rest of this system. 

Our first task will be to recapture the GTC LoneWolf which escaped in the melee.

Since the mysterious closure of the Altair jump node in Tau Sigma over three weeks ago, civilians in the beleaguered system had not been receiving pay or supplies. The situation had grown desperate, with civilians living on emergency rations alone until yesterday, when disgruntled inhabitants of Tau Sigma station took to their vessels or simply seized whatever they could lay hands on and formed a blockade at the jump node to voice their protest."

The protesters met a GTVI group entering through the Altair jump node, demanding pay and better conditions. The GTVI vessels, however, were not prepared to negotiate and demanded that the protesters move their ships from the vicinity of the subspace node. However, the protesters refused point-blank and were met with a terrifying sight as a result - a Lucifer class destroyer, only the second vessel of its type ever encountered."

The appearance of this destroyer sent a wave of panic through the crowds, sparking off a riot. As GTVA forces battled to protect civilians, hired union-busters made an attempt on the life of the protest leader, Adam Tarovich.

5902, "Alright, pilots, intel has just discovered a $r pirate ammunition supply depot near a small moon of $b Tau $b Sigma $b 7. Their supplies are considerable, with some forty-two fighters, six bombers, and the supplies to keep them a pain in our side for some time to come. "

5903, "Vigilant"

5904, "Supplies"

5905, "$g Intel has been using long-range scans to determine the composition and guarding patterns of the depot. We have reason to believe that the pirates and whatever political forces that guide them are set to move to a more secure location within the next twenty-four hours. "

5906, "With the arrival of the $h Nyarlathotep at $f Tau $f Sigma $f Station, it is imperative that we secure the region. This ammunition supply depot has been designated a primary target. Unfortunately, we cannot wait for the additional $g GTVA forces that are enroute to the system. 

With this in mind, we are assembling a strike mission. Time is of the essence. We have a small window of opportunity, as the primary forces guarding the depot are now at their weakest. Even then, it will not be easy. "

5907, "The depot is still guarded by a wing of Hercules class fighters, designated $h White wing. Additionally, the supplies is guarded by no less than twenty sentry guns. The fighters are a credible threat, but the sentry guns are lethal. We will not have enough time to individually destroy each sentry gun to clear a path for our bombers. "

5908, "White"

5909, "The sentry guns are controlled and monitored by a crew aboard the $h Vigilant, a medical cruiser carrying more than three thousand civilians. Regardless of their political or criminal leanings, destroying the $h Vigilant is not an acceptable option. However, by destroying the $b radar $b dish on the $h Vigilant, we will temporarily knock out control of the sentry guns."

5910, "$f Alpha wing, your task is threefold - first, eliminate the fighter cover. Second, destroy the radar dish aboard the $h Vigilant, and third, destroy as much of the ammunition supply depot as possible."

5911, "Destroying the radar dish will only give you a brief window of time when the sentry guns will not work. They will switch to automatic sixty to eighty seconds after they stop receiving communications from the $h Vigilant. 

You will need to place your shots carefully. A well placed $b Cyclops bomb will be the most effective means to destroy the depot."

5912, "Remember, time is of the essence. We estimate that reinforcements are due to arrive in under ten minutes after you jump in. Hit them as hard as you can, and then get out. The $h Vigilant MUST survive the attack. Remember, we are soldiers, not butchers. We must do our best to protect civilian life, even if they fight against us. 

Report to the flight deck, pilots. "

5913, "The most important thing in any strike mission is surviving. The odds are often overwhelming, and the necessity for speed overshadows the need for accuracy. It is a tribute to one's skill when one is both fast and accurate. Good work in at least making it back."

5914, "While speed is essential, the need for accuracy in this mission was also necessary. The destruction of of the Vigilant is unacceptable in this kind of work. You can be sure of severe disciplinary action. If you end up without prison time, I will be very surprised. Get out of my sight."

5915, "Good job in making sure the Vigilant stayed alive. It was all the more difficult, given that she was firing on you while you were making your bombing runs. "

5916, "In taking out the Vigilant's radar dish, you had a little under eighty seconds to do as much damage as you could. "

5917, "White wing put up enough of a fight, but you were able to dispatch them effectively enough. Bombers are not the easiest craft to dogfight with, but then again, our options were limited."

5918, "Congratulations on destroying all the cargo containers. They held parts and supplies for the fighters in the depot."

5919, "The cargo containers contained weapon supplies for the fighters. Unfortunately you weren't able to get all of them in this strike. Better luck next time, pilot."

5920, "Excellent job in destroying all the fighters in the depot. In one swift move, you have saved many lives and have stalled the operations of pirates in the area."

5921, "While you did manage to destroy many of the fighters in the area, several of them survived the engagement. We may well encounter them in future actions. You did what you could."

However, remember that the objective of this mission is to maintain the peace, not to spark off another combat. Avoid combat with any enemy assets as much as possible."

5995, "We have no reasonable explanation for the complete destruction of the pirate supply outpost and the Socrates. It would seem that rivalries between various pirate factions are becoming more heated and bloody. However, most pirates would have taken the defenceless vessels at the outpost, not destroyed them. We may be seeing the work of a dangerous and violent pirate group.  "

Hopefully this will be the last instance of civilian bloodshed on such a large scale. We estimate that two and a half thousand lost their lives today."

With the revelation by the Mercenary forces that Morgan Technologies has been employing them to disrupt and weaken GTVA control in this region in order to increase their own influence, there is only one possible course of action.

We have already sent encoded messages to GTVI and the GTVA Security Council in Delta Serpentis. While the Security Council cannot be expected to respond immediately, the GTVI has already authorised the freezing of all MT assets and impoundment of Morgan vessels operating on the Nyarlathotep. All Morgan employees will be removed from the Nyarlathotep and the Morgan officials will be taken into custody.

Unfortunately Morgan's influence extends beyond merely political subversion. It appears that Morgan Technologies have gathered and supplied a large military force of the most high-tech vessels and weapons in modern-day GTVA fleets. At the head of the MT armed force is the MTD Auriga, a heavily modified Orion-class destroyer. You saw what it did out there, pilots. The Auriga poses a grave threat to the security of the region.

Under normal circumstances you'd be punished quite severely for this failure, but considering the value these mercenaries would have had to us...

From the transmissions sent by the crew of the Event Horizon it appears that Morgan Technolgies has been responsible for the string of attacks on GTVA and civilian targets. The mercenaries were employed by Morgan, but refused to do all of their dirty work for them. It seems that some of the attacks have been on questionable moral ground.

We have already sent encoded messages to GTVI and the GTVA Security Council in Delta Serpentis. While the Security Council cannot be expected to respond immediately, the GTVI has already authorised the freezing of all MT assets and impoundment of Morgan vessels operating on the Nyarlathotep pending a full investigation of the incident. All Morgan employees will be removed from the Nyarlathotep and the Morgan officials will be taken into custody to be questioned about the matter.

Unfortunately Morgan's influence seems to extend beyond merely political subversion. It appears that Morgan Technologies have gathered and supplied a large military force of the most high-tech vessels and weapons in modern-day GTVA fleets.

Your failure today indicates that perhaps the pressure might just be too much for you. While you are not being discharged from service, neither can we risk having you on the front lines, when there is the all-too-real possibility of you screwing up just when it counts the most - as you did today.

It's funny, I've been working on projects like this for almost all of my life. I have been searching for the secrets of the universe for as long as I can remember, and now all I want to do is go home. The Nyarlathotep is an archaeologist's dream. A derelict Shivan superdestroyer found adrift in subspace. Not since the discovery of the ruins of the Ancients have we come across something so horribly beautiful.

The recent business with Morgan Technologies has me concerned. Our research is supposed to be for the benefit of the Terran and Vasudan races. Now I find out that MT has been using their influence to gain political control of the region. They even killed some of my colleagues to get their people on board the Nyarlathotep.

Clearly accurate reconnaissance on the Shivan presence will be required before any action is taken if we don't want to be ambushed again. We will exercise caution in our future attacks."

6501, "Your inability to defend the Andrasta from the Shivan ambush was disappointing, pilot. While we would not have been able to garner much information about Phi Eridani however this engagement had turned out, the loss of a corvette is a blow that we shouldn't have had to take. Furthermore, the Shivans that destroyed the Andrasta continue to guard the Tau Sigma jump node, making any incursion into Phi Eridani far, far more difficult than expected.

While the Valhalla and its escort are ready and willing to enter Shivan space, this failure is not an auspicious start to the operation. Luckily for you, you will not be present - Command has decided that you'd be better off elsewhere, back flying deep space patrols for Tau Sigma Station.

GTD Valhalla
The Superdestroyer Discovered

Okay pilots, we've found the Nyarlathotep. She is hiding in a stellar gas cloud within the Phi Eridani system. Given the presence of both the Tsathoggua and the Tulzscha in system, this setup indicates something much more widespread and dangerous than even the Nyarlathotep by herself. These ships had to come from somewhere, and GTVI is still puzzled as to their source. The only current speculation that we have is that the Nyarlathotep was part of a larger fleet that has been lying dormant in subspace for thousands of years. Dr. Hadamard's speculation that the Nyarlathotep was indeed the Lucifer that destroyed the civilization of the Ancients seems both the most plausible and the most troubling."

6569, "Origins of the Derelict

The Nyarlathotep herself was residing dormant in subspace until a few weeks ago, when she emerged through a rift created by the explosion of the MT Mudenerei AWACs. While it was not clear at the time who was controlling the ships in that subspace battle, subsequent evidence has revealed that Morgan Technologies is behind much of the recent criminal activities in these systems. However, the Nyarlathotep's presence seems to be just the beginning of something darker."

6570, "Previous Shivan Incursions

Thirty-seven years ago, the Lucifer appeared in Ross 128 with no apparent source or reason. The Shivans simply came, and even until today no one truly knows where they came from. Our recent experience has shed light on that war so many years ago, and yet it does not bode well. We barely escaped with our lives from the last Shivan invasion, and if the Nyarlathotep is not alone, the danger is greater than we first imagined."

6571, "GTVA Response

We need information, and we need it now. We have pinpointed the location of the Nyarlathotep, but we do not know her present activities. Before we launch any kind of a strike, we are going to need some accurate information on her location and her status. We are fortunate to have a handful of Mara class fighters in our possession that have been converted so that Terran pilots can fly them. 

I hope you've been brushing up on your Shivan etiquette, pilot. You're going behind the lines."

6572, "At 1715 hours, we pinpointed the source of $r Shivan transmissions in the $b Phi $b Eridani system. The $h Nyarlathotep is located in a small stellar cloud that until now, has been masking all of our scans of the system. Our recent engagements with the $h Tsathoggua and the $h Tulzscha helped us to localize the $h Nyarlathotep's haven. At present, the $f GTD $f Valhalla is on standby, and will be awaiting  with a small strike force of $g GTVA ships that will be ready to deploy in three hours. The information that you provide will be used to launch the strike against the superdestroyer."

6573, "Your task is simple. In captured $b Mara fighters, get close enough to the $h Nyarlathotep and scan her $b Navigation, $b Communications, $b Sensors, $b Weapons and $b Fighterbay subsystems. Your fighters will appear to be $r Shivan, right down to your EM signatures - provided that you do not get too close to patrolling $r Shivans. The interference created by the stellar gas cloud should provide you with enough cover. However, steer clear of the other $r Shivan fighter patrols in the area. If they get too close, you will be readily identified. "

6574, "Given the $h Tulzscha's escape when the $h Tsathoggua was destroyed, we expect this $b Lilith class cruiser to be in the area. If it is present, scan the cruiser, and any other capital ships you find. Do not engage any ships, or it will ruin the element of surprise. 

Keep a low profile, $f Alpha. Remember to keep at least 500 metres between yourself and the fighter patrols."

6575, "Good work, pilot, you managed to scan the Tulzscha and Nyarlathotep's systems as you requested. Unfortunately, upon your initial broadcast, the GTD Valhalla's strike force launched a pre-emptive assault against the Nyarlathotep without your additional information of the growing battlegroup. We managed to signal her in time to pull out of the attack, but at the cost of burning out her jump engines. At present, the Valhalla is stranded in another part of the nebula.  "

6576, "Unfortunately, you let Aries wing get too close to you before you were able to gather the necessary information. We are no further ahead than when we were before. The Nyarlathotep has changed her location within the Stellar Gas Cloud, and we have no idea where she will be turning up next.

Presently the GTD Valhalla is attempting a deep range scan on the edge of the cloud, but so far is not having any luck. You will join her crew in the ongoing search for the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzcha."

6577, "When your wingmates tell you that Aries wing is getting too close, you need to stop completely and let them pass. If any one of those fighters gets within 200 metres of you, the jig is up and everything goes hostile."

Your dereliction of duty has cost us dearly, since we know even less than we did before. This is going on your permanent record.

"

6648, "Pilots, I'll make this quick, as we don't have much time. As you are aware, once we had obtained the scan data we needed from the $r Shivan vessels rallying where the $h Nyarlathotep is at rest, the $f GTD $f Valhalla was going to lead a pre-emptive strike against the Shivan forces. The $f Valhalla did lead a strike against this position, but ran into severe difficulties."

6655, "Once the area is secured, approximately half of the 8,000 crewmembers on board the $f Valhalla will be evacuated in $f escape $f pods. We don't want to risk any more lives on board the $f Valhalla than we have to. Cover the pods as they depart. They have extremely weak hulls and can't take much punishment."

There are several other vessels that need to be evacuated from the nebula region and the $f Valhalla can take care of itself. $g GTVI scans haven't located any larger vessels in the immediate vicinity - however, the large number of small signatures suggests multiple fighter and bomber wings incoming.

Get down to the launch bays, pilots. We haven't got enough time to let you choose your loadout, so it has been preassigned. Good luck."

6659, "The Shivan attack was exceptionally fierce, and we paid heavily for our hasty strike on the Shivan position. The GTD Valhalla was one of the vessels destroyed.  Alpha wing, we were expecting more of you. You had the necessary resources to defeat the Shivans - even their destroyer, the SD Cthon."

6660, "Taurus, Cancer and the Cthon's beam cannon take priority over any other target."

However, a Demon class destroyer is a threat to capital ships in it's own right, as you have seen today. It appears that the Shivan force is larger than we had hoped. We'll need a lot more firepower to deal with this incursion than initially anticipated."

6663, "Unfortunately, the good news that the Valhalla was saved is tempered by the fact that so many of it's crew lost their lives today. The Shivans cut through our defensive screen of fighters and decimated the escape pods. It shouldn't have been beyond you to stop a few Shivan fighters, pilots."

6664, "Aries and Virgo wings target the pods, so get to them before they get to the escaping crewmen."

6665, "Indeed, nearly 8,000 lives were lost here today, for not only was the Valhalla destroyed by the Shivan onslaught, but her crew were slaughtered by the Shivans as they tried to escape. The Shivans broke though our defensive screen and destroyed many pods. Alpha, it shouldn't have been too difficult to fend off a few Shivan fighters. Even if you couldn't save the Valhalla, you could have saved the pods."

GTD Valhalla
The Failure of Subterfuge

Since we were unable to gain any significant information about the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzscha before the Shivans were alerted to your presence, the GTD Valhalla called off her pre-emptive strike. Instead, we are now engaging in search and destroy operations within the Phi Eridani system. Hopefully we will be able to prevent the Shivans from establishing any kind of foothold in this system. Their resources are limited, and the Nyaralthotep will need to establish supply chains to sustain any kind of territorial operations. If we can prevent those chains from ever forming, then we can ensure that this new problem will be nothing more than a footnote in the GTVA's history with the Shivans."

Alpha, you will assist the GTD Valhalla and the GTCv Escher in their search and destroy operations. Presently, they are following another lead in locating the SC Tulzscha.

At 2326 hours, we intercepted a transmission that originates within the Tulzscha. She appears to be stationary and may be vulnerable to a strike. Report to briefing."

From what intelligence we have, there is also an $b Asmodeus class freighter and a $b Rahu class gas miner tending the depot.

6733, "$f Alpha, your task is to eliminate the fighter escort and help the $f Escher destroy the $h Tulzscha's engines and communication systems. We want to prevent her from leaving the area, or calling for help. Once disabled, the Valhalla will deploy recovery vessels to launch a capture assault on the $h Tulzscha. She may not have the same value as the $h Nyarlathotep, but she is much more of an asset to us intact."

6734, "While the $b Asmodeus freighter and $b Rahu gas miner are a secondary priority, consider them targets of opportunity and eliminate them along with the fighter escort. The $h Nyarlathotep's resources are limited - furthermore, our objective and strategy is to starve the superdestroyer into a trap.

Good hunting, pilot."

Perhaps if we had gained more information in the nebula, things would have worked out differently. Less than a quarter of the Valhalla's crew managed to make it to the escape pods.

Things are far worse than we first imagined, pilot. We are moving to evacuate Phi Eridani, and consolidate our forces in Tau Sigma.

Also saddening is the destruction of the GTCv Escher. While there was no way that you could have saved the Valhalla, the survival of the Escher was within your grasp. It is a shame that the corvette did not escape this ambush.

These twin losses have blasted a vast hole in our Eridani expeditionary force, and any hope of withdrawing and living to fight another day has gone.

7077, "Welcome to elsewhere... Command, the count is in. All three destroyers are here, along with three Corvettes, and fifteen cruisers!"

7078, "Can you verify that Alpha? From our previous encounters, we've recorded only two operational corvettes and a handful of cruisers."

7079, "Would you like me to knock on their exhaust pipes and ask for a headcount? I'm serious Command, all of the Shivans are here!"

7080, "I agree Command, we're also getting nothing out here. Just a bit of Shivan wreckage. Looks like they scuttled several supply ships."

7081, "Acknowledged Kappa. Alpha, are you getting anything on their supply convoy?"

7082, "Nothing, Command. Not even a cargo transport or a container. They're all just... lined up."

7084, "As in lined up, they're tighly packed in a formation that isn't more than 3000 metres wide and about 6000 metres long. I don't really want to get much closer."

7088, "The Azathoth has launched some fighters. They haven't seen us yet, so keep it quiet."

7089, "Command! We have a Shivan Knossos portal in the area... it just materialized in front of the Nyarlathotep! What the hell are they doing?!"

7090, "Say again, Alpha?!"

7091, "Do I have to repeat myself? We have a Knossos portal, clearly of Shivan design that just warped in in front of the Nyarlathotep! Transmitting an image of it now."

7092, "Confirmed, Alpha. Finish those scans if you haven't already, and get yourself to a safe distance to watch what's going on. We're notifying the Cypher."

7093, "Command! I have a massive subspace surge! They're warping out!"

7094, "Can you tell where they're going? They must be going somewhere in system!"

7095, "Negative, Command. My instruments are all over the map, I can't tell where they went. I am getting some really odd readings."

7096, "Confirmed Alpha. We're dispatching the Cypher and the Escher to your position now. Can you get a scan on that Shivan Knossos portal?"

7097, "Negative, Command."

7098, "Why not? Was it destroyed?"

7099, "No sir. It went with them. All we have left is a few stray fighters."

7100, "Say again, Alpha 2? Did you say it warped out with them?"

7101, "Yes, sir. That's confirmed. We were hit with a shockwave when she warped out. My readings are telling me something weird, but I can't confirm until the Cypher gets here."

7102, "Standby, Alpha. The Cypher and Escher should be there shortly to relieve you. Secure the area in the meantime."

7103, "Affirmative, Command. I'm going to have to do some overtime at the bar after this one."

7104, "We're on station, Alpha. What have you got for us?"

7105, "Nothing physical, Cypher. But can you confirm a reading I have with your instruments? I have a strong subspace signature here."

7106, "We're getting it too, Alpha 2. Does this say what I think it says?"

7107, "That we're now sitting next to a brand new stable jump node? Looks like it."

GTD Macura
A Second Tour of Duty

Welcome back to GTVI, pilot. As you are now well aware, we have need of your abilities once again. You join us under very different circumstances to your last assignment with Special Operations Command. With the threat presented by the Shivans increasing and spreading into our core systems, we can no longer bide our time but must act quickly.

Our objective over the next series of operations is the destruction of the Morgan Technologies defence force and the capture of its command vessel, the MTD Auriga."

7119, "Motivations Behind the Conflict

Morgan Technologies sought to gain control of the Tau Sigma system in order to exploit the high potential of the system. The corporation attempted to destabilise the region and undermine GTVA control with a series of strikes on civilian targets by hired mercenaries. The MT defence force was intended to replace the GTVA as dominant military power in the system once Morgan had the second thing they wanted - the two million Capellan refugees settling in Tau Sigma. With the refugees and control of the system, they had themselves a ready-made empire."

7120, "MT Warrant

The Auriga and other MT vessels participated in attacks on civilian and GTVA forces and showed no mercy to their enemies. The GTVA considers these forces to be guilty of crimes against the Alliance and war crimes under the provisions of civilian protection decree in BETAC. The Security Council issued a warrant for the capture or destruction of the MT vessels yesterday. The Auriga and her accompanying flotilla must be brought to justice."

7121, "Our search for the $h Auriga and the other $r MT military vessels begins in $b Tania $b Australis, the last known location of the $r Morgan $r Technologies destroyer. Our scouts believe that an $r MT vessel has been sighted near $b Wayfarer $b Station, and so you're going in to take a closer look."

7122, "$b Wayfarer $b Station is the largest artificial structure in $b Tania $b Australis, and is the principal stop-off point for a large number of fringe-dwelling miners, explorer vessels and less savoury elements of society. It is also, unfortunately, the location at which the $r MT vessel was sighted. You're going to be flying into a potential combat situation in which there will be a lot of civilian targets. This complicates matters a great deal."

7123, "Wayfarer Station"

7124, "You will be flying a $b Perseus fighter and be assisted by $f Beta wing, also flying $b Perseus interceptors. We weren't able to get a positive ID on the $r Morgan vessel, so your primary objective will be to identify the $r MT ship among the other targets. Once this has been achieved, try to disable it so that the recovery craft $f Giordano can extract the vessel's crew.  "

7125, "MT Vessel"

7126, "Cover the $f Giordano during the recovery op and prevent the destruction of the $r MT ship if possible. If the $b Wayfarer security forces present any opposition, you have limited authority to return fire. Do not destroy these civilian security vessels under any circumstances. However, $r Morgan fighters are fair game. Hopefully, once we have the $r MT prisoners our interrogations will yield positive results."

7127, "Giordano"

7128, "You failed to identify and capture the Morgan Technolgies vessel. Though traffic was high, this was a relatively simple task that you should've been able to complete with only basic training. The fact that you're a pilot of some skill highlights the fact that you should've carried out your mission objectives properly."

7129, "Scan all ships for MT crew until they are discovered. Follow your wingmen's suggestions as well."

7130, "Deserting the field is a serious enough offence in any mission - and a covert operation with high tactical value even more so. You failed the mission, your wingmen, and, worst of all, us at GTVI. Don't think that you'll be selected for special duties again, pilot."

7131, "You did well out there considering what we had to put up with - flying in a hot zone with many civilian targets, mistaken identity by the local security personnel, and an attack by mysterious fighters. Flying in this kind of environment always presents danger to our pilots and also to the civilians who we are sworn to protect. The risk of a shot hitting a civilian freighter or explorer is high in this kind of mission, but fortunately you showed skill and restraint, even when under fire from friendly forces. This isn't something that every pilot can boast."

7132, "The crew of the disabled MTT Juno isn't talking under conventional questioning methods, and because they're not strictly military personnel we're going to need special authorisation from GTVI HQ in Ikeya if we want to continue our inquiry. This could take some time. Nevertheless, the capture of this crew is a significant step forward. You did well out there, protecting our transport from the unwanted attention of hostile fighters. Their origin remains unknown, though it's a safe bet to assume that they were MT or pirate fighters."

7133, "The wanton destruction of the MT transport before the Giordano even had a chance to dock with it is simply unacceptable. We expect our pilots to show intelligence and restraint, and yet you have shown neither of these traits. It makes me wonder why they ever asked you back to serve again in the first place."

7134, "Don't destroy the MT transport, disable it! The crew is needed for interrogation."

7135, "The destruction of the GTT Giordano prevented us from retrieving the Morgan Technologies crew from the Juno, and so we've lost a valuable lead in addition to the loss of a fine capture crew. Lieutenant Commander Phil Barker and his team will be sorely missed by their colleagues and their families."

7136, "Protect the Juno and Giordano during docking. After that, you'll just have to concern yourself with the Giordano. She's weak, so don't let the fighters get through."

The last transmission from the convoy stated that they were under attack and that several vessels had been disabled. This convoy was meant to be top-secret, and so an $r MT attack on it is of the utmost concern. It is unlikely that the $r Morgan attack group simply stumbled upon the convoy."

7284, "It would also be reasonable to assume that were there anything out there to salvage, $r Morgan might come back and finish what they started. The convoy possesses considerable defensive firepower but their status is unknown and if $r MT ships attack, you will be called upon to defend friendly targets in the area.

You're going out into an unknown, possibly volatile situation. Tread carefully and keep your wits about you."

Because of your efforts, the recovery craft were all able to dock and escape safely with the crews of the stricken convoy craft. By all rights this situation shouldn't even have happened. The method by which Morgan Technologies obtained the co-ordinates of the convoy remains unexplained.

However, it would seem that all of your effort was in vain. The Vaisang, Kucedre and Adjmetu didn't show up at the designated rally point, and have failed to do so in the intervening hours. Our search teams have found nothing to suggest they didn't make it - not even debris. The three recovery transports, their crews and those of the convoy craft have simply vanished. Command can give no valid explanation for this."

7287, "The freighters Emza and Selu both escaped with their crews. This may only be a small number of personnel to survive, but if our operations have saved only one person then they have not been in vain."

Without the accounts of the crews, and with the surviving convoy craft so badly damaged as to be useless, we may never know quite what happened out there.

GTD Macura
A Final Confrontation

Enough is enough. In spite of the mysterious roadblocks we've encountered, we have finally found a way to draw out the MTD Auriga. She has caused us a great number of problems over the past few weeks, from interfering with searches for the Shivans to massacring civilians and raiding scientific installations with no apparent method behind the madness. Although it is only one vessel, the Auriga has caused more damage than some small NTF battlegroups did at the height of the war. Now, we must deal with the Auriga."

7519, "Capabilities of the Auriga

The Auriga is an immensely powerful vessel, armed with heavy beam cannons and capable of far more damage than a normal Orion class destroyer. It is also protected by a limited self-repair mechanism and a beam cannon inhibition device. These pose great problems to our forces when attempting to combat the vessel."

7520, "Beam Inhibitor Technology

We now know that the inhibitor works by disrupting our ion beams with electromagnetic radiation as they form, causing them to collapse. This effect prevents friendly vessels from firing, while the Auriga itself remains unaffected. The technology appears to have been developed around the framework for Admiral Bosch's ETAK design."

7521, "Beam Cannon Workaround

Fortunately, sensor scans of the Auriga, coupled with our knowledge of the ETAK project and other pieces of data from captured MT Elite Guard crews have helped us a great deal. We believe that we have enough information to temporarily negate the beam cannon inhibitor. This will enable us to launch an attack on the Auriga on roughly even footing.

On the orders of GTVI, we are now initiating an operation to neutralise the threat posed by the Auriga."

7522, "Intelligence Directives

GTVI wants the Auriga captured, not destroyed. This will not only eliminate the threat posed by the MT destroyer, but it will give us a powerful and much-needed tool with which to fight the Shivans. The motives of the crew of the Auriga remain shrouded in mystery.  As you'd expect, GTVI want to know their motives as well."

7523, "The Auriga's Value

The Auriga is a technological treasure trove of designs thought lost during the GTI Rebellion thirty-seven years ago, plus experimental technologies that we weren't even sure were possible. How all of this found its way onto a corporate destroyer is a mystery. GTVI also believe that the Auriga has the power to take on the Nyarlathotep."

7524, "Your Task

Capturing this vessel will be a tough job, but it may be our only hope. Our best pilots have therefore been picked for the job. Get down to the briefing room, Alpha. You're going to play an instrumental role in this mission."

7525, "Alright, pilots, let's get right down to business. The $h MTD $h Auriga is cornered in $b Delphi, from which there is no apparent escape route. The only node discovered in this system thus far is too unstable for subspace travel. The $g 3rd $g Battle $g Group has been directed to assist us in this operation, so we have considerable resources available."

7526, "However, the $h Auriga will not reveal itself readily. The vessel has proven on too many occasions already it's capacity for evasion.

Fortunately our scouts have located a temporary supply depot set up by a forward group of $r MT vessels on the edge of the $b Delphi system. It is hoped that a strike at the depot will draw the $h Auriga out to defend the supplies and guard vessels."

7527, "Supply depot"

7528, "The supply depot is guarded by an $b Aeolus cruiser, the $h MTC $h Minerva, and one wing of fighters, designated $h Halberd. The supply depot attack force will consist of the $f GVCv $f Andrasta and two fighter wings, $f Alpha and $f Beta."

However, the $h Minerva must not be destroyed. She'll be used to bait the $h Auriga out into the open."

7532, "When the $h Auriga arrives, our trap will be sprung. The $f Andrasta will signal the $f GVD $f Luxor and our additional fighter and bomber reinforcements to enter the field of engagement. The $f Luxor is carrying modified sensor equipment which should allow our vessels to fire their beam weapons despite the $h Auriga's beam cannon inhibitor. The $f Luxor has also been given additional ablative armour to increase resistance to the $h Auriga's attacks."

Unfortunately, all of our preparation was for naught and the GVD Luxor has been heavily damaged.  She'll be in drydock for a month or more while the engineers fit a whole new engine array and repair the secondary damage.

However, we were able to overcome the Auriga's beam inhibition device and attack the destroyer directly. This technology will come in handy should we have to face the Auriga again. Our scientists hope to adapt the device to inhibit the beams of hostile vessels in the future as well."

7541, "Despite the failure of our primary objective, we were able to destroy all remaining Morgan Technologies vessels. The MT defence force has effectively been destroyed, the Auriga being the only surviving vessel."

7542, "Not only did the Auriga escape but we were unable to destroy the remainder of the Morgan Technologies defence forces. Although a small group, we will still have to expend time, energy and vessels to track them down, and at a time when the Shivan fleet is pushing into our core systems, these are resources we can ill afford to waste.

Nevertheless, the threat posed by the MT defence force is effectively over."

Vanishing of the Shivan Fleet

Eight days ago, the Shivans disappeared from the Tau Sigma system with no sign of where they went. Somehow, the SD Nyarlathotep summoned a device similar to the Ancient Knossos portal discovered in Gamma Draconis, with which they then stabilized a previously unknown jump node. In an instant, more than twenty capital ships suddenly vanished, with only this new mysterious subspace corridor in their wake."

A Sirian Civilian Rescue team had been sent to investigate a transmission loss from a mining operation in one of the star system's asteroid belts.

Shortly thereafter, probes confirmed that the Shivans had opened up a previously unstable jump corridor between Tau Sigma and Sirius."

''A standard Meson bomb detonates without focus and spreads its massive destructive power in a large spherical area. By stripping out and modifying a Zephyrus class vessel, it can be used to focus the Meson charge into a coherent beam with incredible destructive potential. While the cannon is fragile and unstable, no vessel of destroyer class or below can withstand the power that it unleashes.''

We're going to be putting this to the test soon. Report to mission briefing, pilots."

7785, "$g Command has authorised the deployment of the $f GTVX $f Gorgon experimental cannon for this operation. As you have heard, the cannon focuses the energy released during a Meson reaction into a coherent beam. Although the beam is powerful, the cannon itself has a low damage threshold. It is for this reason that we are deploying a considerable defensive force to protect the $f Gorgon."

7786, "Gorgon Cannon"

7787, "You're part of that force, $f Alpha wing. The $f Gorgon will be defended by $f Alpha and $f Delta wings and the cruisers $f GTC $f Hyperion and $f GVCv $f Jilvaa. Due to the importance of this mission, you will be permitted to carry the $b UD-8 $b Kayser cannon, our most powerful primary cannon.

Bear in mind that while your primary objective will be to protect the $f Gorgon cannon, we would like the cruisers back in one piece if at all possible. We have more fronts than just this one to fight on, and we need every capital ship we can get."

7790, "The $b Rakshasa class cruiser, $h SC $h Nodens, captured by $g GTVI during the Second Great War, has been deployed approximately two kilometres from the $f Gorgon cannon. Despite being crewless, its computers continue to respond to the $r Shivan signal. Our engineers stripped the cruiser of most of it's weapons and engine assembly long ago. This will at least prevent the $r Shivans from using the vessel against us or any autopilot taking over and forcing the cruiser to depart. Instead, the $r Shivans will have to come and get the cruiser themselves."

7791, "Nodens"

7792, "Our captured cruiser has already attracted some $r Shivan attention. While only fighters have yet arrived, heavier support is sure to follow soon. The $r Shivans have attacked all $g GTVA vessels nearby, so it will be the job of $f Alpha and $f Delta to intercept any incoming fighters or bombers. Vessels attacking the $f Gorgon are to be given top priority. Everything else can take care of itself."

7793, "Gemini"

7794, "If, or when, we lure the $r Shivan capital ships out of hiding, the $f GTVX $f Gorgon will handle them. The initiation sequence for a sustained blast from the cannon is considerable and your wings will be expected to fend off the $r Shivans until then. Don't engage the $r Shivan capital ships and don't get caught in the $f Gorgon's beam. The effects will be permanent, to say the least."

7795, "Capital ships"

7796, "The instability of the $f Gorgon must be constantly compensated for to prevent a critical overload of the cannon's main reaction chambers and power regulators. It is for this reason that the cannon must be manned, however dangerous this may be. Defend the cannon at all costs, $f Alpha. The twenty-three technicians and scientists on board will be counting on you to get them through this.

Get down to the loading bays, $f Alpha. It's time to bag ourselves some $r Shivans."

7797, "The arrival of the SD Azathoth was unexpected and caught our forces off-guard. We had not expected to lure such a vessel into the area. It was only thanks to the quick action of the crew of the GTVX Gorgon cannon that we were able to eliminate the Shivan destroyer. It is the first major victory we can claim.

However, this victory comes at a price. The GVCv Jilvaa was annihilated by the Azathoth and the crew of the Gorgon cannon were killed in a Meson containment breach that destroyed the cannon. The loss of the prototype may be a blow, but it is the loss of life that is most terrible."

7798, "The GTVX Gorgon cannon was destroyed by the Shivans, killing all 23 on board. We were only able to destroy the SC Chaugnar and as a result to Shivan fleet remains strong. The destruction of a vessel such as the SCv Hastur would have provided some relief for our hard-pressed forces.

We're received news that our operation to destroy the SD Azathoth also failed. The Shivan vessel destroyed the GTCv Endurance and moved into Vega, to join the rest of the Shivan fleet. Things do not bode well for the Alliance."

7799, "Intercept Leo wing immediately to prevent the cannon's destruction.  If the Shivans board the Nodens the cannon will also be destroyed, so do not let this happen."

7800, "The GTC Hyperion survived this engagement and will now assist in strikes on the Shivan fleet elsewhere, bolstering our offensive capability.  Captain Jacobson of the Hyperion thanks the 212th for defending his vessel."

7801, "The GTC Hyperion did not survive this engagement. Considering the odds we faced this is not surprising, but with the loss of the GVCv Jilvaa in the same battle the Hyperion's survival would have been a much-needed break for our forces."

7802, "Don't let Libra wing deal too much damage, and watch out for stray bombers."

Rebus Station
The Shivan Armada's Procession

Since the Shivan fleet jumped into the Sirius system just over a week ago and began their journey through our systems, we have desperately been trying to hold them off, slow them down, or thin them out. However, our operations have met with only limited success. While we were able to destroy the SD Azathoth with the GTVX Gorgon cannon in Deneb, we lost the prototype and several other vessels."

7931, "The Vega Engagement

In a recent engagement, an attempt to destroy the Shivan fleet failed, with the destruction of the GVD Resheph and GTD Ignatius as the result. Several smaller vessels were also destroyed and we barely dented the fleet. The official death toll stands at over 23,000, with many more missing and presumed dead. Obviously, with conventional attacks failing another method must be found to deal with the Shivans."

7932, "Unconventional Warfare

Command believes that it has discovered just such a method. A Deimos-class corvette under construction here in Vega has been modified to carry only a skeleton crew and a payload of Meson bombs. This vessel, the GTCv Argentus will be used to ram the Nyarlathotep. It is hoped that the vulnerabilities observed in the Lucifer's reactors could be capitalised upon here, though we have one available to us - the Nyarlathotep does not appear to have the same shielding that the Lucifer did."

7933, "The Ultimate Destination

We will therefore not have to destroy the Nyarlathotep within a subspace corridor and risk losing the ability to travel through the jump node, but the Shivans will not simply let us ram the Argentus into their command ship unopposed.  After monitoring Shivan fleet movements our experts believe that the Shivans' movement patterns are consistent with travel to only one destination - Beta Aquilae.  It is at the Beta Aquilae-Vega jump node that we will mount our attack on the Nyarlathotep."

7934, "New Technology

It will be a difficult task to eliminate the Nyarlathotep, but fortunately our defence forces have a new tool to aid them - the GTB Hydra. The Hydra is a next-generation refit of the GTB Artemis, a true fighter-bomber with improved armour, maneuvrability and afterburner reserves. The Hydra can also mount the UD-8 Kayser cannon, making it a formidable foe to enemy capital ships and fighters alike."

7935, "Combat Evaluation

The Hydra has been brought into service early due to the threat posed by the Shivans, so you'll be 'testing' her, so to speak, as the Hydra hasn't had an OpEval period. Use her well - basic flight trials have shown excellent potential in the vessel.

Get down to the Quarterdeck, they're waiting for you."

However, note that the $f Argentus will explode with considerable force. Get out of harm's way if possible. Courageous pilots are one thing, martyrs quite another."

8052, "This is beginning to make some kind of sense... in that case, what we're fighting here is a diversion."

8053, "You call THIS a diversion?"

8054, "That's a rog, Hetepet. Command, request permission to investigate the site of the old Capella node."

8055, "Denied, Cypher. We need you here to help deal with the Cthon."

8056, "But Command..."

8057, "The answer is no. Focus on dealing with the Cthon, we can address this later."

8058, "Apologies pilots, but there's somewhere we need to be and no time to spare. GTFf Cypher signing off."

8064, "All right! That one's for the Valhalla, you big son-of-a-bitch!"

8065, "Shivan bombers have entered the area. Alpha wing, provide assist... hold on, we're receiving a long-range communication signal. Stand by."

8066, "Command, this is the Cypher. I think you might want to take a look at what's going on over here..."

8067, "Say again, Cypher? Have you encountered resistance?"

"

8079, "Sorry to shove you into a brand-new $b Hydra and brief you while enroute, but we don't have time. It looks like Lt. Mackie and the crew of the $f GTFf $f Cypher were right, and now we have very little time to act. The $h SD $h Nyarlathotep, and her accompanying fleet, were never on a course for $b Beta $b Aquilae, but were attempting to return home. It now appears that they might just succeed. The $h SD $h Cthon and the bulk of the $r Shivan fleet engaged our forces near the $b Beta $b Aquilae node. We destroyed the $h Cthon and seem to have the rest of that battle under control, but we may have lost the war. "

8080, "The $h Nyarlathotep is attempting to stabilize the jump node to $b Capella, which was destroyed five years ago when the $f GTD $f Nereid was detonated inside the corridor. The explosion destabilized the node, and stopped a massive $r Shivan fleet from pushing further into $g GTVA space. From our experience at the new $b Tau $b Sigma-Sirius corridor, if the $h Nyarlathotep is successful, the door to $b Capella will once again be flung wide open. We have one last hope, or we will all face annihilation."

8081, "Capella"

8082, "The $f GTFf $f Cypher has engaged the small fleet guarding the $h Nyarlathotep at the remnants of the $b Capella jump node. She has bought us enough time to rally the $f GVD $f Khefrem and the $f GVCv $f Estennu to provide support for the $f GTCv $f Argentus to make her run. $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet may still have some life after all.

The $f Cypher has transmitted the coordinates for the superdestroyer. The $h Nyarlathotep is engaging with her weapons, but not maneuvering. It appears she must remain still in order to summon their own $b Knossos portal from subspace, and shortly thereafter stabilize the node. Our window for opportunity will be very narrow, and we will only get one shot."

8083, "In order to make this happen, our first order of business is getting the $f Cypher to safety. She is presently within beam range of several $r Shivan cruisers, and is in a direct firefight with the $h SCv $h Cthulhu. The $h Nyarlathotep has launched bombers, which are presently bearing down on the frigate. The $f Cypher is attempting to move out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep, but will need cover as soon as you arrive. "

8084, "The $f Cypher is transmitting the coordinates of the $h Nyarlathotep directly to the skeleton crew of the $f Argentus. If she is destroyed, the explosives-laden corvette will not be able to make her run. You must ensure that the $f Cypher makes it safely out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep or any capital ships in the area. The $f Khefrem and $f Estennu will provide fire support against the cruisers - your task is to intercept any bombers."

8085, "Estennu"

8086, "The $h Nyarlathotep is not unguarded. In addition to her own formidable weaponry, the $h SC $h Nyogtha and $h SC $h Tulzscha, a pair of $b Lilith class cruisers, flank her. They are armed with exceptionally powerful beam weapons, and are guarding her more vulnerable underside. Once the $f Cypher has made it to safety, the beam weapons of these cruisers are your primary target. Either destroy the turret or destroy the cruiser - just make sure they cannot fire. The $b Liliths are a tough nut to crack, so be careful in your choice of action."

8087, "Additionally, the $h Nyarlathotep's rear-most beam weapon has a field of fire that covers her underside. While not as devastating as her principal forward beams, this weapon is as powerful as the lateral cannons, and is still a major threat. If the $f Argentus is to succeed in her mission, this threat must also be eliminated."

8088, "Rear Turret"

8089, "Once these cannons are eliminated, the $f Argentus will make her attack run on the $h Nyarlathotep. Keep any stray fighters or bombers clear of her, but be careful. When the $f Argentus collides with the superdestroyer, the blast will destroy any small craft in the area. Do what you have to to succeed, but come home if you can."

8138, "Aye aye, sir. Let's blow this bird, she's pissed me off one too many times."

8139, "Command, I'm getting a bad feeling about this. We're getting some subspace distortion here... she may be closer to activating the portal than we realized."

8140, "Are you sure, Cypher?"

8141, "Very sure, it's now a full blown surge. The gate will be arriving at any moment! Get the Argentus ready, we may have to do this hot! Alpha, get on those beams!"

8142, "That's it Command, the gate is arriving any second now. Tell the Argentus it's now or never."
