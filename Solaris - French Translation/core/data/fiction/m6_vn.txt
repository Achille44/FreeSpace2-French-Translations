MSGXSTR "Akrami" 5459 "A massive energy burst was detected, powerful enough to cause shockwaves through hyperspace." 5482 "06a-04"

MSGXSTR "FLEET COMMUNIQUE" 5296 "CAPTAIN RAMLY - FNS ARTEMIS, DURIUS SYSTEM" 5487
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "Admiral Akrami is deploying the Artemis to the Morik system for a recon mission." 5488 "06a-09"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "Though the Artemis is fully repaired and combat capable, we're going into this mission understrength." 5489 "06a-10"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "We still await personnel replenishment to bring our crew and pilot numbers back up to a full complement." 5490 "06a-11"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "Despite these setbacks, I know we're still more than capable of performing this mission." 5491 "06a-12"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "Deck crews will notice the new complement of Thunderbolt interceptors." 5492 "06a-13"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "Our mission parameters have changed. With the escalating conflict, we are progressing into an ASM-heavy combat environment." 5493 "06a-14"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "This is in contrast to the fighter-heavy combat of the Elam-Qahtadnan conflict." 5494 "06a-15"
MSGXSTR "Ramly" 5298 "The journey to Morik will take several days. Updates will be forthcoming as soon as they're available." 5495 "06a-16"

MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5040 "GILES CAVILL - CAG" 5496
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5308 "Hey Ross. Looks like I'll be stuck in Durius Installation medbay for a while. The medics tell me I'm still on enforced sick leave." 5497 "06a-17"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5308 "I got a report from forensics after they dug through my bird - looks like a Combine shell tore through the air filter and gave me a dose of waste emissions before the safeties kicked in." 5498 "06a-18"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5308 "Anyway, I may grumble but I'm counting my lucky stars I'm still here. Doing better than a lot of other people." 5499 "06a-19"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5308 "Not making me any less impatient to be back in the cockpit. Don't get into too much trouble out there while I'm down, okay?" 5500 "06a-20"


MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5040 "MIMI 'PUNCHY' BERTONE" 5501
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5502 "Hi Razor. I'm leaving the Artemis and joining up with the Colossus fighter squadron. Everyone gets a goodbye note. This is yours." 5503 "06a-21"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5502 "We haven't really talked much but you seem like a good guy. You're an Alban like Raptor so you get bonus points." 5504 "06a-22"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5502 "Take care of Raptor while I'm gone, okay? You let anything happen to her, I'll come find you and kick your ass." 5505 "06a-23"
MSGXSTR "Bertone" 5502 "Ok Razor. I'll see you round." 5506 "06a-24"
