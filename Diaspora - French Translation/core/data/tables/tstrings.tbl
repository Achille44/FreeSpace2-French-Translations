341, "You rescued Obit against the odds. I don't wish to sound ungrateful, as we need every pilot we have, but you violated a direct order to recall and defend the Theseus. Under normal circumstances, you would be subject to a court martial.

However, I am grateful that you made it out of there alive, and came to our aid when you did."

342, "Understood. Concentrating fire on their engines."

343, "The Theseus is commencing fueling operations. It will be a few hours before we are at full capacity but we will have enough supplies to reach Virgon and maintain combat operations within thirty minutes.

We are recalling all recon wings to the Theseus. Cylon forces have not yet detected us through the debris field but baseships are massing in low Aerilon orbit. Based on reports from Picon and Caprica, it appears that they are preparing to bombard the planet from orbit.

One of our Raptor flights has established contact with the fleet at Virgon. Over 90% of the fleet was annihilated in the initial attacks but there is hope of mounting a counter-attack from Virgon.

While we might be watching Aerilon burn as we refuel, never forget that we still have a chance to protect some of our homes."

344, "The baseship was destroyed before reinforcements arrived. The mission proceeded as planned, and we believe that the Cylons should be unable to discern our current location."

345, "Going for their engines."

363, "Piece of cake, sir. Disarming target."

364, "Yes sir. Eyeing for their weapons systems."

365, "Understood sir. Disarming target now."

366, "Use your wingmen to maximum effect to ensure that the basestar is disarmed and destroyed before reinforcements arrive."

367, "You did the best that you could in protecting the civilians, but not all of them made it through the attack. Remember that more Cylons will arrive once they realize our location. Each ship we lose means thousands of lives. With billions already dead, every single life on these ships matters even more."

368, "Intercept Heavy Raiders and bombs first, they pose the most threat to the civilians."

369, "Copy that. Pulling their teeth."

370, "Your failure to disable the main batteries of the basestar may have cost us needless lives. The Theseus sustained several direct hits, and DCON crews are working around the clock. We must be even more careful in picking our future engagements."

371, "You remained undetected while retrieving Obit Unfortunately, these efforts to cover our tracks were all for nothing...."

372, "Acknowledged pilot, disarming target now."

373, "The Theseus was destroyed with all hands aboard. The Cylons have jumped out, leaving us to our fate knowing that we don't have rendezvous coordinates or enough fuel to reach any Colonial installations that might still survive.

For what it's worth... it was an honor serving with you pilot. "

374, "I have grave news. The Cylons look like us now. A Cylon agent detonated an explosive device near our fuel lines. We nearly lost the Theseus, but the damage was contained.

The Cylon agent was jamming wireless communications and transmitting our position to their fleet, and signalled for the boarding action. This... machine was neutralized.

Our recalled recon flights have confirmed devastation on Picon and Tauron. Picon Fleet Headquaters were destroyed in the initial attacks. We have received messages that surviving Colonial assets are currently being marshalled in orbit of Virgon. 

Our top priorities are to replenish our tylium reserves and establish contact with the fleet. We do not have enough fuel to jump to Virgon and we will be unable to maintain combat operations with our current supply."

375, "[DISARMING TARGET]"

376, "Use your wingmen to help disarm all heavy missile batteries."

377, "Nearly half of the civilians were lost during the engagement. The Cylons will return in full force. Although the Theseus is well armored we're vulnerable while refuelling. You must do better pilots if we are going to make it through this."

378, "All civilian vessels save the Indart were lost. The Cylons will return in full force. Although the Theseus is well armored we're vulnerable while refuelling. You must do better pilots if we are going to make it through this."

379, "The Theseus was destroyed with all hands aboard. The Cylons have jumped out, leaving us to our fate knowing that we don't have rendezvous coordinates or enough fuel to reach any Colonial installations that might still survive.

For what it's worth... it was an honor serving with you pilot. I suggest that we don't draw this out longer than we have to."

380, "About time! Engaging!"

384, "We need you back out there, pilot. Report to the briefing room in five minutes."

385, "Let's get this over with... Engaging."

386, "The Theseus jumped without us. Cylon forces jumped out of the area in pursuit. We don't have rendezvous coordinates or enough fuel to reach any Colonial installations that might still survive.

For what it's worth... it was an honor serving with you pilot. "

387, "Although we failed to neutralize the Cylon baseship, there have been no signs of pursuit. We have earned ourselves a brief reprieve despite our losses. 

At present we are hiding in the low orbit of a gas giant. The radiation belts should shield us from Cylon detection for the time being.

We are preparing reconnaissance Raptors to assess the situation on our home worlds. As of yet, we have still received no word from the fleet. Civilian channels have also been silent.  

On the subject of our downed pilot, a search and rescue mission is being prepared for Obit as we speak. This will be a volunteer mission, but I would like for you to take lead on it."

388, "To destroy the Basestar you must protect the Theseus' main batteries and ensure Purple wing delivers its payload of warheads."

389, "Engaging enemy!"

390, "From what we have learned today, it is possible that Orange lead was a Cylon agent. Why this pilot volunteered for a mission to ensure the death of a single pilot, as opposed to aiding the detonation of explosives as a second agent did, is a mystery. 

The Colonies are in ruins, and our own future is grim. It is only a matter of time before the Cylons find us in our damaged state, and finally end this..."

We detected a $h Cylon reconnaissance fighter on long range DRADIS. We're refueling your bird, and scrambling all fighters. Our FTL systems are now unlinked, but it will take twenty minutes for the civilians to calculate a jump solution. We must be able to hold off whatever the $h Cylons can bring to bear for that time.

751, "We should approach the debris to confirm that they are all destroyed before returning to the Theseus."

752, "I can't believe it, flesh and blood toasters?"

756, "These raiders are agile as hell."

757, "Jump complete. I'm reading two DRADIS contacts, Cylon raiders. Might be a rear guard. They haven't detected our emissions yet. As long as we don't shoot or get too close we should be fine."

758, "I'm picking up a faint wireless signal. It is too weak for an exact fix, but we can try to trace it."

759, "I'm not reading anything on DRADIS other than the toasters. But if we can get within a klick or two of that signal I can get a lock. I don't think they've detected it yet."

760, "Friendly fire, break off!"

761, "Found him!"

762, "The Theseus was destroyed with all hands aboard, along with all civilian ships. The Cylons have jumped out, leaving us to our fate knowing that we don't have rendezvous coordinates or enough fuel to reach any Colonial installations that might still survive.

For what it's worth... it was an honor serving with you pilot. I suggest that we don't draw this out longer than we have to."

763, "He's... he's... Gods damn it... we're too late."

764, "I don't think that the Cylons really look like us. They're doing this to people. Probably have been for years. Ripping the brains out of men and women, plugging in microchips, and turning them on us."

765, "Hell, that makes more sense. No one would willingly turn on their own, right?"

766, "Keep your finger off the gods damned trigger unless you know what you're shooting at! Moron."

Commander Adama has taken command of what remains of the fleet and has called for every qualified pilot to serve. I've heard rumors that some survivors from the Triton have joined her crew.

We all did what we had to in order to survive. In the end, that's all that matters. There's no reason to be a gods damn hero if there's no one to remember you."

Welcome, pilots, we've been selected to participate in the Command Network Program trial runs. According to the brass, this is a new operating system that will be used in the central computers of our birds and tied to the navigation and comm systems of all our cap ships and stations.

The CNP provides what they call a 'unified command and control framework' and is supposed to help increase efficiency throughout the fleet."

783, "Stand by. Orange 2 will jump in to retrieve you."

784, "All right, we need to get within 100 meters and cut the throttle. You keep the Raptor steady while I open the hatch. Should take less than thirty seconds."

785, "Opening hatch now."

786, "Lords, that nugget just bought it!"

787, "Holy frak, comms traffic is a mess. I can't make heads or tails out of anything. I'm not sure if it's because civvie channels are flooded, the clankers are jamming everything, or both."

794, "What?"

795, "Saying frak the most over wireless in one op, moron."

796, "Multiple Cylon contacts. Long range DRADIS is still fraked up, how the hell did they find us?"

797, "Damn it, we lost one of the good ones..."

798, "Theseus to Orange lead. Thank the Lords our distress call was received. Our fuel lines were ruptured by an internal explosion which also damaged our FTL. The Cylons then jumped in."

800, "Gods damn, with the fuel lines ruptured and those fires... they had to vent our tylium reserves. Frak me, the emergency reserves are barely enough for..."

801, "COMMAND NETWORK PROGRAM TESTS

Of course, we've all heard the rumors. The CNP is supposed to turn a rook or nugget into an ace. We've been given the honor of putting that to the test over the next few weeks.

You have been selected because you represent our top pilots. I'll address the rooks later. Your feedback on the auto-assist systems developed for the CNP will be critical in how it will be deployed in the fleet."

802, "COMMAND NETWORK PROGRAM TESTS

For those of you volunteering for these tests, you'll be getting double pay. But I know that shore leave on Virgon is at the front of most of your minds before we ship out.

I know a some of you, like Obit, owe a few too many cubits on Pallas, so I suggest you take this opportunity to move your finances out of the red and into the black.

Those who have decided to take part in these tests, meet in the briefing room in ten minutes. That is all."

803, "Pilots, you need to buy us time to get our FTL back online. DC crews are starting to contain the fires. We should be able to get more birds in the air shortly."

853, "Hey, that's some good work!"

854, "Stay within the exercise area."

855, "All right pilots, this is the part of the exercises you've all been waiting for. We've noticed that some of the comments by the techs behind the $b CNP have gotten on your nerves. I believe the one about a nugget in a $b CNP equipped $f viper being better than any of $f Theseus' pilots was the worst."

856, "All pilots, prepare for emergency combat landing procedures. We're getting the hell out of here."

857, "DC crews have reported that FTL systems are back online. We are commencing FTL prep."

858, "I've suggested that we put this to the test in the next round of simulations.

We're counting on you, as a skilled pilot, to defend $f Theseus' honor here. "

870, "Excellent kill, sir!"

871, "It was good to finally see Obit in a one on one against you. He's already said that he'll start losing to you as soon as you're more used to the CNP though. 

Given Obit's scores in CNP vipers, I'm not surprised that he beat you. Looks like there's a good challenger for the Theseus' Top Gun."

872, "Now that was impressive!"

873, "That was impressive. Keep it up."

874, "Save some secondaries for your fight against Obit. Remember to use evasive action and, if necessary, use the Theseus as cover."

875, "Looks like you managed to conclusively prove that the CNP is not a replacement for the experienced pilot. The CNP techs will have to quit their bragging now. 

Given Obit's scores in CNP vipers, beating him was very impressive. When you're off duty the first round's on me."

876, "You managed to show that the CNP isn't a replacement for a skilled pilot. Of course holding your own against a nugget doesn't mean much.

Personally I think it's only a matter of time before you lose your Top Gun status on the Theseus. Obit performed damn well during the CNP trials and it's only a matter of time before he becomes our next top pilot. Maybe if you brush up on your skills with the CNP you can hold onto that title..."

877, "Although you defeated the nugget your performance was still poor. You should be able to achieve the tasks given you much more quickly and accurately. "

878, "Well it looks like the eggheads were right and the CNP does mean that even a nugget can beat the Theseus' Top Gun. We'll be the laughing stocks of the fleet.

Personally, I think you need to shape up and remember it's the man behind the stick and not the bird that's important."

879, "Intercept and destroy. Just hold them off a little longer pilots..."

880, "We've lost Obit. Gods damn it..."

881, "You... you... killed Obit... What the hell are you? How could you even... No... no you're going to pay for this... you're going to pay... *gunshot*"

886, "Thank the gods. All transports were intercepted before deploying boarders."

887, "Damn it! The Theseus jumped out and we don't have rendezvous coordinates..."

888, "I don't think there's a way out of this one, sir. Looks like we're on our own with half of the Cylon fleet... let's make damn sure they'll remember us..."

893, "Pilots, we've sustained heavy damage. Keep the Cylons off us!"

894, "Our hull is critical. Keep those bogeys off of us, pilots!"

895, "Damn it sir, we can't do anything to help him. We have to get out of here, now!"

896, "I should start taking notes, great work sir!"

897, "This is Orange 2. We are ready to retrieve Red 3."

898, "HUH! HA! That was a fine piece of shooting!"

901, "Save some missiles for this fight and remember to use countermeasures."

902, "Since I scored higher than you did in the tests, the CAG decided to send me against the nugget. She's sayng that you owe me the Top Gun trophy mug too. "

903, "Remember to quickly target ships and manuver in combat trials. Better performance will earn you a chance against the nugget."

904, "Unfortunately, we won't be getting much more time to play with the CNP anyway. 

Orders have come in for a three month patrol along the armistice line. We'll probably be the last ship in the entire fleet to get the CNP upgrade at this rate.

341, "You rescued Obit against the odds. I don't wish to sound ungrateful, as we need every pilot we have, but you violated a direct order to recall and defend the Theseus. Under normal circumstances, you would be subject to a court martial.

However, I am grateful that you made it out of there alive, and came to our aid when you did."

342, "Understood. Concentrating fire on their engines."

343, "The Theseus is commencing fueling operations. It will be a few hours before we are at full capacity but we will have enough supplies to reach Virgon and maintain combat operations within thirty minutes.

We are recalling all recon wings to the Theseus. Cylon forces have not yet detected us through the debris field but baseships are massing in low Aerilon orbit. Based on reports from Picon and Caprica, it appears that they are preparing to bombard the planet from orbit.

One of our Raptor flights has established contact with the fleet at Virgon. Over 90% of the fleet was annihilated in the initial attacks but there is hope of mounting a counter-attack from Virgon.

While we might be watching Aerilon burn as we refuel, never forget that we still have a chance to protect some of our homes."

372, "Acknowledged pilot, disarming target now."

373, "The Theseus was destroyed with all hands aboard. The Cylons have jumped out, leaving us to our fate knowing that we don't have rendezvous coordinates or enough fuel to reach any Colonial installations that might still survive.

For what it's worth... it was an honor serving with you pilot. "

374, "I have grave news. The Cylons look like us now. A Cylon agent detonated an explosive device near our fuel lines. We nearly lost the Theseus, but the damage was contained.

The Cylon agent was jamming wireless communications and transmitting our position to their fleet, and signalled for the boarding action. This... machine was neutralized.

Our recalled recon flights have confirmed devastation on Picon and Tauron. Picon Fleet Headquaters were destroyed in the initial attacks. We have received messages that surviving Colonial assets are currently being marshalled in orbit of Virgon. 

Our top priorities are to replenish our tylium reserves and establish contact with the fleet. We do not have enough fuel to jump to Virgon and we will be unable to maintain combat operations with our current supply."

390, "From what we have learned today, it is possible that Orange lead was a Cylon agent. Why this pilot volunteered for a mission to ensure the death of a single pilot, as opposed to aiding the detonation of explosives as a second agent did, is a mystery. 

The Colonies are in ruins, and our own future is grim. It is only a matter of time before the Cylons find us in our damaged state, and finally end this..."

Commander Adama has taken command of what remains of the fleet and has called for every qualified pilot to serve. I've heard rumors that some survivors from the Triton have joined her crew.

We all did what we had to in order to survive. In the end, that's all that matters. There's no reason to be a gods damn hero if there's no one to remember you."

CO Anise 'Harridan' Zhou

Welcome, pilots, we've been selected to participate in the Command Network Program trial runs. According to the brass, this is a new operating system that will be used in the central computers of our birds and tied to the navigation and comm systems of all our cap ships and stations.

The CNP provides what they call a 'unified command and control framework' and is supposed to help increase efficiency throughout the fleet."

783, "Stand by. Orange 2 will jump in to retrieve you."

784, "All right, we need to get within 100 meters and cut the throttle. You keep the Raptor steady while I open the hatch. Should take less than thirty seconds."

785, "Opening hatch now."

786, "Lords, that nugget just bought it!"

787, "Holy frak, comms traffic is a mess. I can't make heads or tails out of anything. I'm not sure if it's because civvie channels are flooded, the clankers are jamming everything, or both."

788, "Obit is aboard. We're making our way back. Keep the door open for us."

789, "He's aboard and secure. Get us the hell out of here."

790, "I'm reading weapons fire. Gods damn it, they found our pilot! Obit... he's... as good as dead. Let's get back to the Theseus while we can."

791, "Sir?... SIR!?... Damn it!"

792, "We've been detected. Looks like we'll have to fight our way out of this one."

793, "I'm sure Orange lead has thicker skin that you. By the way, you have 164 to go before you beat the record."

794, "What?"

795, "Saying frak the most over wireless in one op, moron."

796, "Multiple Cylon contacts. Long range DRADIS is still fraked up, how the hell did they find us?"

797, "Damn it, we lost one of the good ones..."

798, "Theseus to Orange lead. Thank the Lords our distress call was received. Our fuel lines were ruptured by an internal explosion which also damaged our FTL. The Cylons then jumped in."

799, "Internal fires have blocked access to the hangar deck. We haven't been able to launch any birds, and long range wireless is being jammed."

800, "Gods damn, with the fuel lines ruptured and those fires... they had to vent our tylium reserves. Frak me, the emergency reserves are barely enough for..."

801, "COMMAND NETWORK PROGRAM TESTS

Of course, we've all heard the rumors. The CNP is supposed to turn a rook or nugget into an ace. We've been given the honor of putting that to the test over the next few weeks.

You have been selected because you represent our top pilots. I'll address the rooks later. Your feedback on the auto-assist systems developed for the CNP will be critical in how it will be deployed in the fleet."

802, "COMMAND NETWORK PROGRAM TESTS

For those of you volunteering for these tests, you'll be getting double pay. But I know that shore leave on Virgon is at the front of most of your minds before we ship out.

I know a some of you, like Obit, owe a few too many cubits on Pallas, so I suggest you take this opportunity to move your finances out of the red and into the black.

Those who have decided to take part in these tests, meet in the briefing room in ten minutes. That is all."

803, "Pilots, you need to buy us time to get our FTL back online. DC crews are starting to contain the fires. We should be able to get more birds in the air shortly."

804, "No one could have survived that..."

805, "New DRADIS contacts. Cylon heavy raiders, CBDR. Intercept and destroy. "

806, "A Cylon heavy raider has landed in our hangar deck. We are being boarded! Fire teams have been assigned to contain the centurions currently aboard, but we can't hold off a full scale boarding action. Destroy those heavy raiders!"

807, "More centurions have boarded. Our fire teams are being overwhelmed. It's only a matter of time before they reach damage control."

808, "A second heavy raider has reached the Theseus and is unloading centurions! We can't afford to let any more through!"

809, "Pilot down. Repeat, pilot down!"

810, "Damn it! We've lost another one..."

811, "Well, there goes another pilot..."

812, "This is Yellow lead. Distress call was received, moving in to engage. Hold tight."

813, "Pilot down. Repeat, pilot down!."

814, "Pilot down! Repeat pilot down!"

815, "Pilot down! I repeat, pilot down!"

816, "Sir, report your status? Sir? If you can hear me, deploy a beacon."

826, "Good kill, sir!"

827, "All centurions have been neutralized. Marine fire teams report heavy casualties."

828, "Not bad... not bad at all..."

829, "All centurions have been neutralized. Marine fire teams are reporting only light injuries."

830, "Pilots, the Cylon heavy raiders are on an approach vector with our flight deck. We believe that the Cylons may be attempting a boarding action. Intercept them before they reach the Theseus!"

831, "The $f Battlestar $f Theseus is taking part in the $b Command $b Network $b Program test trials. You are to follow instructions and familiarize yourself with the $b CNP interface for your $f MKVII $f Viper.

832, "Your reaction time in standard maneuvers and targeting protocols will provide key data the brass needs in order to decide whether or not to implement the $b CNP. Don't flub this$semicolon we need honest assessments.

"

833, "<<<THESEUS DEPARTING IN $countdowntimer SECONDS>>>"

834, "Keep in mind, pilots, the brass is likely going to implement the $b CNP, regardless of our recommendations. So use this as an opportunity to familiarize yourself with how our birds are gonna be flying from now on."

835, "Pilot, you passed the basic Command Network Program exercises in a satisfactory manner.

Although some of the new CNP controls may be counterintuitive, it is good to see that our most skilled pilots are still able to perform well.
"

836, "
"

837, "Gods damn, I've terminated the transmission. The toasters are sending that on all channels."

838, "Two Cylon baseships have jumped in! They must have received that signal. I'm reading active nuclear warheads on both ships."

839, "Good work pilot, but don't let it get to your head."

840, "That toaster is history, sir!"

841, "Not too bad, sir. Not as good as me, though..."

842, "Not too bad, pilot!"

843, "Pilot, your performance during the basic Command Network Program exercises was less than satisfactory.

You won't have much time to shape up and increase your performance with basic flight, as we're gonna be leaving Virgon shortly."

844, " "

845, "Over the coming weeks, we will be involved in a series of combat exercises in the Pharsalus field. These exercises will put all of our flying skills to the test.

850, "Scratch one bogey, sir?"

851, "Scratch one bogey sir?"

852, "Despite being told that you had several minutes to test new systems we are on a tight training schedule. Your decision to not land in a timely manner has delayed exercises. This is unacceptable behavior and you will be removed from these exercises if this continues."

853, "Hey, that's some good work!"

854, "Stay within the exercise area."

855, "All right pilots, this is the part of the exercises you've all been waiting for. We've noticed that some of the comments by the techs behind the $b CNP have gotten on your nerves. I believe the one about a nugget in a $b CNP equipped $f viper being better than any of $f Theseus' pilots was the worst."

856, "All pilots, prepare for emergency combat landing procedures. We're getting the hell out of here."

857, "DC crews have reported that FTL systems are back online. We are commencing FTL prep."

858, "I've suggested that we put this to the test in the next round of simulations. We're going to put several nuggets through a series of tests, and we'll then play the exact same tests for you in a non-$b CNP $f viper. We're counting on you, as a skilled pilot, to defend $f Theseus' honor here. "

859, "Do not ram your Viper into other craft. Continued gross negligence of proper flight protocols will lead to demerits on your record."

860, "Nice work sir! You're gonna leave some for us, right?"

861, "Good job, sir!"

862, "Nice shot!"

863, "Today's trials will compare your performance in a non-$bCNP $f viper to our nuggets in $b CNP enabled ones. Tests will range from assessing basic skills like targeting and gaining a missile lock, to a full scale combat trial against multiple opponents. We will then have you against one of the nuggets in a dogfight to decide if the techs' claims really are true. Show us your best performance out there. Dismissed."

864, "Nice aim, sir!"

865, "[TARGET NEUTRALIZED]"

866, "You're... almost getting to be as good as me.... Almost."

867, "Theseus, how long until FTL is back online?"

868, "Systems are nearly online, two minutes. Prepare for combat landing."

869, "Theseus, we're reading more Cylon raiders incoming. Designation X-Ray, they're armed with nukes."

870, "Excellent kill, sir!"

871, "It was good to finally see Obit in a one on one against you. He's already said that he'll start losing to you as soon as you're more used to the CNP though. 

Given Obit's scores in CNP vipers, I'm not surprised that he beat you. Looks like there's a good challenger for the Theseus' Top Gun."

872, "Now that was impressive!"

873, "That was impressive. Keep it up."

874, "Save some secondaries for your fight against Obit. Remember to use evasive action and, if necessary, use the Theseus as cover."

875, "Looks like you managed to conclusively prove that the CNP is not a replacement for the experienced pilot. The CNP techs will have to quit their bragging now. 

Given Obit's scores in CNP vipers, beating him was very impressive. When you're off duty the first round's on me."

876, "You managed to show that the CNP isn't a replacement for a skilled pilot. Of course holding your own against a nugget doesn't mean much.

Personally I think it's only a matter of time before you lose your Top Gun status on the Theseus. Obit performed damn well during the CNP trials and it's only a matter of time before he becomes our next top pilot. Maybe if you brush up on your skills with the CNP you can hold onto that title..."

877, "Although you defeated the nugget your performance was still poor. You should be able to achieve the tasks given you much more quickly and accurately. "

878, "Well it looks like the eggheads were right and the CNP does mean that even a nugget can beat the Theseus' Top Gun. We'll be the laughing stocks of the fleet.

Personally, I think you need to shape up and remember it's the man behind the stick and not the bird that's important."

879, "Intercept and destroy. Just hold them off a little longer pilots..."

880, "We've lost Obit. Gods damn it..."

881, "You... you... killed Obit... What the hell are you? How could you even... No... no you're going to pay for this... you're going to pay... *gunshot*"

882, "Damn that was brutal, sir! But... the clanker deserved it."

883, "I'm almost impressed."

884, "Seems like you're on fire today!"

885, "Looks like I need to start taking notes, great work sir!"

886, "Thank the gods. All transports were intercepted before deploying boarders."

887, "Damn it! The Theseus jumped out and we don't have rendezvous coordinates..."

888, "I don't think there's a way out of this one, sir. Looks like we're on our own with half of the Cylon fleet... let's make damn sure they'll remember us..."

889, "Two new wings of Cylon raiders have jumped in. They are armed with warheads. They're targeting our main batteries!"

890, "...keeping me alive... *static* trap... *Broad Frequency Signal*"

891, "I cut off the wireless. Whatever the hell that was, it's flooding all channels and has altered every toaster to our location. We... we have to get out of here... now."

892, "As long as we keep our distance from the Cylons and we don't fire our weapons this should go very smoothly."

893, "Pilots, we've sustained heavy damage. Keep the Cylons off us!"

894, "Our hull is critical. Keep those bogeys off of us, pilots!"

895, "Damn it sir, we can't do anything to help him. We have to get out of here, now!"

896, "I should start taking notes, great work sir!"

897, "This is Orange 2. We are ready to retrieve Red 3."

898, "HUH! HA! That was a fine piece of shooting!"

899, "Good kill! Nice shooting, sir."

900, "Red 3 is secure. Returning to Theseus Orange lead."

901, "Save some missiles for this fight and remember to use countermeasures."

902, "Since I scored higher than you did in the tests, the CAG decided to send me against the nugget. She's sayng that you owe me the Top Gun trophy mug too. "

903, "Remember to quickly target ships and manuver in combat trials. Better performance will earn you a chance against the nugget."

904, "Unfortunately, we won't be getting much more time to play with the CNP anyway. 

Orders have come in for a three month patrol along the armistice line. We'll probably be the last ship in the entire fleet to get the CNP upgrade at this rate. 

You'll have a few days to get your things in order before we ship out. I suggest you take the next shuttle to Picon. Dismissed."

1400, "FTL calcs completed. Beginning jump for Ragnar. If you can land before the jump we're glad to have you... otherwise... I'm... sorry."

1401, "You son of a bitch! Our drives don't have the range to make it to Ragnar with the fuel we have! We need to land! Damn it! Hold on a few more minutes!"

1408, "We will coordinate shuttles to dock with your ship and evacuate it. Please standby. All fighters, cover the fleet and be ready to make combat landings."

1409, "Where's our evac? Are you just going to leave us here?"

1410, "I'm sorry Queen Vera, we don't have a choice."

1415, "Pilots, we are jumping in 30 seconds."

1416, "We've lost the Theseus! All ships clear the area! Prepare to jump out."
