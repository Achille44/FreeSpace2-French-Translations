MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I've got big news from the local feeds. The Motina Kometa crew just swore allegiance to Gadaria's Militia. They were the second largest Fringe group after the Malikans, and Gadaria's only remaining serious challengers." 6967 "14a-16"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The Malikans now have almost uncontested ownership of deep Fringe space, and enough military hardware to challenge the Sulsian Navy." 6968 "14a-17"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "This is bad news. The only reason the Fringe groups hadn't overrun the Sulsian Navy before now is that they were competing with each other and disorganised enough to be suppressed piecemeal." 6969 "14a-18"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "With the Fringe groups organised under one leader, the Sulsian government has upgraded the threat level to Severe. I'll keep a close eye out for more updates over the next few days." 6970 "14a-19"

MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Ross, we've finally invested in some new equipment for you and Meiks. Lau has to be the most miserly entrepeneur I've ever met." 6971 "14a-01"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "You've got the option of Maxim cannons now. They're Federation-standard, firing solid flechettes instead of the Huaqing's explosive-tipped rounds." 6972 "14a-02"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "This decreases the damage potential, but the rounds are faster and more accurate. Federation philosophy appears to be 'get enough ordnance on target, and the rest will sort itself out.'" 6973 "14a-03"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Like the Huaqings the Maxim pods are modular so it's a quick job to swap them out. Just let me know ahead of time." 6974 "14a-04"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Personally I don't care for them as much as the Huaqings but Lau says I'm just biased towards Combine equipment. They're there if you want them." 6975 "14a-05"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Ross, Meiks. This is probably a bad idea but we're doing it anyway. We've picked up a distress call from the Sulsian warship Protogeneia." 6976 "14a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "It looks like the Malikan militia's pulled off something big. They've ambushed the flagship of the Sulsian Navy, hit her reactor and left her adrift." 6977 "14a-07"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The Hoshikuzu is the closest ship that can help. I'm bringing her in." 6979 "14a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "We're going in without much info but here's the best plan I've got." 6980 "14a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Undock from the Hoshikuzu and move to defend the Protogeneia from incoming missiles. The Hoshikuzu will move to take up a defensive position alongside the battlecruiser." 6981 "14a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "We're going to try and buy time for the battlecruiser to restore power to her systems. The Opus is a lot bigger than we are and I don't plan to go near that ship." 6982 "14a-12"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The Protogeneia is a pre-Great War relic, but she's all brute and muscle. We just need to cover her while she restores power to her engines and weapons for a counter-attack." 6983 "14a-13"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I've been in contact with Latona waystation. Multiple Sulsian Navy ships are scrambling to assist, but none of them will arrive in time. We're likely be by ourselves during this engagement." 6984 "14a-14"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Everyone good? Ok. Let's go save some Sulsians." 6985 "14a-15"
