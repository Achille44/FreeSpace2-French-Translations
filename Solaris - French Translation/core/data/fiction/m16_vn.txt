MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Ross, listen. I've got some big news. Master Badami of the logistics ship Hopewell has contacted me with an intriguing proposition." 7027 "16a-23"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "The Hopewell is undergoing conversion into a light carrier. Vicare yards say she'll be ready for flight operations in just under a week." 7028 "16a-24"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Badami asked me to train his crew in strikecraft maintenance. In return he's loaning us two Warden fighters from the Hopewell's strikecraft complement. Yeah, I told you it was big." 7029 "16a-25"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "If you're not familiar with Wardens, they are decent heavy fighters. The Sulsians make good use of them in their navy. They're cannons only, but can move better than your missile gunships." 7030 "16a-26"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "Like the Comet gunships, I've modified them to accept modular primary cannon banks. You'll be able to fit one bank of light kinetics and one bank of medium cannons." 7031 "16a-27"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "The only issue is the guns tend to overheat quickly. The frame wasn't really designed for heavy cannons. However, the platform's got a versatility you won't find outside of current-gen strikecraft." 7032 "16a-28"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "I've kept them in storage in the Vicare Station hangars alongside your gunships. We should be able to bring them along to the Hoshi's next sortie." 7033 "16a-29"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "As usual, let me know ahead of time so I can make them ready." 7034 "16a-30"
MSGXSTR "Kaur" 6922 "If you need to find me, I'll be on the Hopewell running deck training. See you soon." 7035 "16a-31"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Looks like our reputation precedes us. I've been approached by Reverend Lightowler of the survey vessel Pillar of Fire. He's been running the Children of Renewal operations here at Vicare." 7036 "16a-32"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Lightowler wants an escort for a mission out near the edge of the Pallavian Veil. If you're not familiar with the Veil, the closest border is at least twenty light years from here." 7037 "16a-33"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "So it's definitely not a small journey, but we've got the time. The Hoshikuzu is fully repaired but the Vicare yards report Nassau will still need at least a week." 7038 "16a-34"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I'm not sure if you've ever been there. It's a huge multisystem nebula around a star cluster. The radiation and gravity makes it a volatile area of space." 7039 "16a-35"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "It's a long way away from colonised space and far out of the way of major transit lanes. I'm not expecting any trouble, but I wouldn't want to sail through the Veil without a good astrogation suite." 7040 "16a-36"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I haven't seen any ship like the Pillar of Fire before. She looks...pretty unique. Her master assures me that her astro equipment is up to specification." 7041 "16a-37"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I don't know what Lightowler plans to do out in the Veil, but it seems like an easy enough job. The Renewal are planning to take the Sulsian refugees to the Covenant system in a few days to meet up with their congregation." 7042 "16a-38"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Lightowler wants the survey mission finished before they move out. He seemed to think this part was important." 7043 "16a-39"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I'll round up the rest of the Hoshi's crew. We sail in two hours." 7044 "16a-40"
