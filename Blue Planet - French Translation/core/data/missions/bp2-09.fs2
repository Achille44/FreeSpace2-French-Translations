 XSTR("To the officers and crew of the UEFg Indus,

At 0750 today $f Admiral $f Netreba passed a coded directive to elements of $f Second $f Fleet. In a break from Byrne's doctrine of defensive war, $f Calder and $f Netreba have finalized their plans for the creation of an elite strategic unit. The objective of this task force will be to undertake risky offensive operations against the $h GTVA war machine. The Admirals hope to derail $h Admiral $h Steele's plan for a crushing attack on Earth by year's end.

The $f Altan $f Orde and $f Katana, two surviving frigates of Calder's Third Fleet, will join this task force. From Second Fleet, Netreba has selected the $f Yangtze ... and the $f Indus. 

I am proud of each and every one of you. Our ship has earned this honor, and she will continue to do so with every mission she and her pilots complete. Hope lives on. 

I will provide details of our first mission, the oft-rumored 'Big Op', in the days to come. For now, stand to your duties with the utmost vigilance.

Hey, Laporte. Maybe you should pick better war cries to make fun of. Apparently the Yangtze pilots are calling our task force the 'Wargods', after a certain Indus captain's morale-boosting battle shout par excellence.

I'll bet you a Jump Five shift that it's going to catch on.

 XSTR("$b Second $b Fleet $b Strategic $b Update
$b Cleared $b for $b Limited $b Dissemination

From the Admiral's Desk

To the officers of Second Fleet Mars, this is a monthly high-level update.

The strategic situation is this. The $h GTD $h Imperieuse has withdrawn to Delta Serpentis to replenish its squadrons after spearheading the Blitz against Earth.

This leaves the $h GTD $h Atreus, the $h GTD $h Carthage, and the $h GTD $h Hood in-system conducting flight operations. In spite of his public statements, Steele is currently building up assets for his planned coup de main. 

In order to prevent our three Fleets from striking, he has deployed the GTD Hood's squadrons to conduct constant raids against military targets in Earth Sector. The pressure is intense and First Fleet refuses to give up any assets for non-defensive operations.", 9653)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("Steele has also launched a series of aggressive attacks against Second and Third Fleet assets in Mars sector. In the past few days, we have lost two training squadrons and six supply depots, including forty-eight uncrewed Izra'il assault fighters awaiting deployment. We cannot regain any strategic momentum under these conditions.

Unlike the attacks on Earth, we are unable to determine the origin of these raids. Subspace vectoring is inconclusive and we have yet to detect a consistent origin point.

Operations are under way to counter this threat and put us back on the attack. In spite of the stance of our honored Elders and Admiral Byrne, Calder and I have concluded that some offensive operations are necessary to prevent our total defeat.

Thank you all for your loyalty and steadfast devotion. We will persevere.

Our strategic objective is to gain the Second and Third Fleets a respite from constant raids so they can hit back and take some pressure off $f Earth.

Our tactical objective is the capture and retrieval of the $r Agincourt, an $r Anemoi class logistics vessel. There are only two of these ships in-system. Designed as mobile resupply platforms capable of field-repairing a destroyer or servicing an entire battle group for months, these ships are packed with sophisticated technology - and therefore incredibly valuable.", 9655)

 XSTR("The $r Agincourt is the key to the constant, unpredictable $r Tev raids on Mars. Instead of jumping back to Jupiter to rearm and refuel, $r GTVA strike craft and warships rendezvous with the $r Agincourt as it jumps around the system, moving above and below the plane of the ecliptic. The $r Agincourt tops ships off with fresh armor, subsystem repairs, and ordinance, then sends them back in.

Now, as those of you who got through Tactical know, the $r Agincourt is just as close as Jupiter - five minutes away by subspace. The advantage to a mobile rally point is that we can't easily predict the source of the raids and track them to their target via subspace vectoring. This is how they keep blindsiding us. We can't tell when they're coming, and we can't hit back.

That ends now.", 9657)

We made our best shot at the Agincourt, but the Tevs were ready, and the operation failed. We're not going to get a chance like that again. Admiral Netreba is disbanding the Wargods and returning us to front-line duty. We may never go on the offensive again during the remainder of the war.

I have some bad news. We're out of the war for six days. Due to engine damage sustained during the assault, we're moving the Agincourt to a nearby intrasystem gate via fusion drive. Because we can't give away our position to the Tevs, there will be no subspace traffic in or out of our position: that means no reinforcements, no jumps home, and absolute comms silence.

The GTVA is hunting for the Agincourt. We've detected Aurora scouts making hops throughout the area. Fortunately, it appears we've moved the Agincourt far enough from its scheduled coordinates that the Tevs are having trouble finding it - space is huge and very empty. Better yet, Admiral Calder has deployed three escorted ECM decoy ships to further confuse matters.

Now for the good news. That was an excellent mission, Wargods. We successfully coordinated gunship fire, interception, and precision strikes, and achieved a difficult and strategically critical objective. I'm very proud of every one of you.

The Indus and Yangtze took damage during the assault. They'll be escorting the Agincourt out, performing active-armor repairs via polymer injection and doing systems and turret run-ups.

The Agincourt is fully under the control of our marines, and I've convinced a contact to 'liberate' some of the Agincourt's stocks for us. We'll have fresh water, mattresses instead of pallets, and a lot of entertainment during the next few quiet days. I'll draw up a patrol schedule, but my goal is to get all of you rested and ready for what's to come.", 9672)
