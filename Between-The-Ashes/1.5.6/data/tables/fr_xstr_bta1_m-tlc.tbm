1879, "Nous avons vaincu les Shiviens, mais ce n'était pas sans perte. Notre monde a disparu et nous sommes laissés dans la confusion. Où allons-nous maintenant ? En qui avoir confiance ? Nous sommes dans les décombres et pourtant nous devons apprendre comment survivre quand les Destructeurs reviendront."

1880, "Accueil Chaleureux"

1881, "L'Intrepid arrive à Antares et déploie l'escadrille Alpha pour une patrouille de routine autour de la station d'Antares. Pendant leur quart, Alpha découvre une opération de contrebande bien planifiée."

1882, "$b * $b GTD $b Intrepid
$b * $b Système $b Beta $b Aquilae 
$b * $b 08/07/36

$b Votre $b nouvelle $b assignation

Pilotes, je suis l'$b Amiral $b Po$| . J'aimerais souhaiter la bienvenue à tous les anciens membres du personnel de la $r GTI qui retournent au service actif. Je sais que cette année a été une longue année d'enquêtes, et cela n'a été facile pour aucun d'entre nous. La rébellion était très répandue au sein de la $r GTI$| , mais votre retour signifie que vous avez été autorisé à reprendre du service. C'est un jour spécial pour les pilotes, un jour où nous pouvons retourner aux fondations de notre $b Alliance $b Terrienne $b Galactique $b (GTA) et travailler ensemble à nouveau.

Vous serez affecté au $b 47e $b Egorgeurs$| , un escadron des opérations spéciales à bord du $g GTD $g Intrepid$| . En raison de votre expérience et de vos qualifications, votre escadron aura des rôles multiples allant de l'escorte et des raids au renseignement et à la capture prioritaire."

1883, "$b Statut $b du $b cessez-le-feu

Comme vous le savez, la $b GTA et la $b PVN respectent toujours l'accord de cessez-le-feu qui a été mis en place pendant l'$r Incursion $r shivienne$| . Les Vasudiens semblent respecter leur part du marché, et nous avons l'intention de faire de même. Je pense que nous sommes tous d'accord pour dire que les combats doivent cesser. Nous avons prouvé que nous pouvions travailler ensemble. A présent, il est temps que nous le fassions indéfiniment. La plus grande menace pour les relations $b vasudo-terriennes réside dans le $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière $r (HoL)$| . Ce groupe de voyous continue à entraver les routes commerciales et à terroriser les civils. Le $r HoL est en tête de liste des priorités de la $b GTA$| ."

1884, "$b Etat $b de $b la $b Flotte

Cependant, la guerre avec les $r Shiviens nous a mis dans une situation difficile. Nos ressources militaires sont maigres et le $b Commandement $b de $b la $b GTA a dû redistribuer une grande partie de sa flotte. Le $g GTD $g Soyakaze a été assigné à $y Regulus pour faire face aux troubles civils croissants. Un préjudice de quatorze ans a causé de grands bouleversements alors que les Vasudiens continuent à s'installer dans le système. Le $g GTD $g Bastion se dirige vers les colonies extérieures de $y Capella$| . Quant à nous, nous avons reçu l'ordre d'occuper $y Antares$| ."

1885, "$b Notre $b théâtre $b d'opérations

$y Antares est un système très divisé. Il a été contesté pendant la majeure partie de la $W Guerre $W vasudo-terrienne et, à ce titre, son économie est un désastre. Le pire, c'est le marché croissant des activités illégales, notamment la contrebande et le commerce illégal. Nos ordres sont de rechercher et de mettre un terme à ces opérations. 

Il faut savoir que ces groupes criminels utilisent beaucoup les anciens modèles de chasseurs terriens, notamment l'Angel, le Shrike, le Mustang et l'Ion. Ils ont modifié leurs appareils pour utiliser des technologies de postcombustion et de bouclier plus récentes. Certains d'entre eux ont même intégré des modèles de propulseurs de manœuvre modernes, alors ne les prenez pas à la légère.

Nous arriverons à $y Antares dans trois heures. Profitez de ce temps pour visiter les archives de la $B carte $B du $B système et vous familiariser avec $y Antares$| . Nous avons également commencé à archiver les rapports et les médias du système dans la $B Salle $B de $B Presse$| . Ce serait une bonne façon de commencer à comprendre la culture d'$y Antares et des personnes dont vous allez être responsable. Certains d'entre vous seront en alerte à notre arrivée, alors présentez-vous à vos briefings de mission d'ici là."

1886, "Bienvenue à Antares, pilotes. Je suis le $b Lt. $b Maria$|. Comme vous le savez, nous sommes ici pour une mission de maintien de la paix. Nos ordres généraux sont de compléter les forces de sécurité locales contre les activités illégales et les forces légères du $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière $r (HoL)$|. Nous nous dirigeons vers la $g Station $g Antares$|, une nouvelle installation de classe Arcadia qui est toujours en construction. Nous arriverons dans l'heure qui suit."

1887, "Station Antares"

1888, "Intrepid"

1889, "Psi"

1890, "Pendant que nous sommes ici, nous allons nous réapprovisionner et prendre contact avec la sécurité locale. La $b GTA est à court de personnel et de ressources, donc la $g Station $g Antares est protégée par ses propres forces. Bien que la station elle-même soit encore en construction, elle est déjà devenue un centre de trafic important dans ce système. En tant que telle, la zone sera très fréquentée."

1891, "Votre travail consiste à compléter la sécurité de la station pendant que nous sommes ici. L'escadrille Psi fait partie de cette sécurité et sera en patrouille à notre arrivée. Il y a eu une augmentation importante de la contrebande à $y Antares au cours des derniers mois. Une partie de notre objectif ici est d'y mettre fin. Soyez à l'affût des activités de contrebande..

Escadrille Alpha, vous êtes de premier quart. Escadrille Gamma, vous êtes en réserve."

1892, "Pilotes, il est de notoriété publique que notre arrivée n'est pas populaire. Volez fièrement, vous êtes toujours des pilotes de la $b GTA. Malgré ce que la population semble penser, l'$b Amiral croit que nous pouvons faire de bonnes choses ici. Présentez-vous au pont d'envol dans trente minutes."

1893, "$b Alpha$| , vous avez détruit quelques-uns de ces cargos. Nous vous avions demandé de limiter les pertes au minimum pour une raison. La mort de civils aux mains des pilotes de la $b GTA n'arrange pas notre situation."

1894, "La décision d'essayer de ne pas tirer sur les transporteurs sera controversée. Nous sommes ici pour maintenir la paix, mais ce n'est pas un secret que le gouvernement local considère cela comme une occupation militaire. Vous avez bien travaillé sous la pression et vous méritez des félicitations."

1895, "Vous ne pouviez pas savoir que le premier cargo était un leurre. Cependant, vous avez bien géré la situation et vous avez aidé à sécuriser la zone. Maintenant que les raiders ont montré un intérêt pour l'$W armement $W IEM$| , nous allons être à l'affût. Il sera difficile de réussir à nouveau ce genre d'attaque."

1896, "Beau travail concernant le scan du convoi de cargos. Nous avons déjà commencé à les suivre jusqu'à leur destination. Nous devrions avoir plus d'informations dans l'heure."

1897, "Cependant, vous n'avez pas permis à l'un des cargos marqués du convoi de s'échapper. Malheureusement, cela signifie que nous ne pouvons pas suivre leur destination prévue. Maintenant qu'ils savent que la $b GTA surveille cette station, il est peu probable qu'ils essaient à nouveau. Nous sommes dans le désert, pilote, et nous n'avons aucun moyen de trouver les voleurs."

1898, "Cependant, vous n'avez pas réussi à scanner l'un des cargos marqués du convoi. Malheureusement, cela signifie que nous ne pouvons pas suivre leur destination prévue. Maintenant qu'ils savent que la $b GTA surveille cette station, il est peu probable qu'ils essaient à nouveau. Nous sommes dans le désert, pilote, et nous n'avons aucun moyen de trouver les voleurs."

1899, "Vous n'avez pas réussi à scanner toutes les caisses du dépôt de marchandises. Bien que nous cherchions à obtenir une évaluation précise de l'état d'avancement de la construction de la station, au vu des circonstances, cela ne représentait plus une priorité."

1900, "En scannant tous les conteneurs du dépôt de construction, nous avons une évaluation précise de l'état d'avancement de la construction de la station. Bon travail."

1901, "Vous aviez reçu l'ordre explicite de suivre votre itinéraire de patrouille. La situation ici est extrêmement tendue et nous ne pouvons tolérer que des pilotes ne suivent pas les ordres."

1902, "Vous aviez reçu l'ordre explicite de ne pas détruire ce cargo. Vous leur avez désobéi et, ce faisant, nous avons perdu un atout précieux pour mettre fin aux activités illégales de ce système."

1903, "Vous avez abandonné votre quart, pilote. Vous êtes une honte parmi l'escouade."

1904, "De plus, vous avez sauté vers un endroit inconnu. La raison pour laquelle vous êtes revenu ici est une chose que vous pouvez expliquer lors de votre cour martiale, pilote. Rompez."

1940, "Escadrille Alpha, ici le contrôleur de vol de la station Antares. Nous avons un fort trafic en approche. Vous pouvez suivre la trajectoire de vol qui vous a été assignée. Veuillez maintenir votre vitesse maximale et vous abstenir d'utiliser la postcombustion."

1941, "Alpha 1, ici Psi 1 de la Sécurité d'Antares. Notre patrouille est claire et votre aide n'est pas nécessaire. Cependant, comme l'Alliance insiste, nous n'avons pas le choix. Veuillez rester à l'écart de la zone d'amarrage et me signaler toute activité. Nous sommes en charge ici, compris ?"

1942, "C'est quoi, son problème ?"

1943, "L'Alliance n'est plus populaire par ici depuis la fin de la guerre vasudo-terrienne. Surtout depuis que les militaires ont quitté Antarès parce qu'il était trop difficile à défendre."

1944, "Antares a subi le pire de la brutalité que les Vasudiens et les Shiviens pouvaient rassembler pendant une longue période. Le gouvernement de l'Alliance vient à peine de se décider à nettoyer la zone."

1945, "J'ai entendu dire que le gouvernement local avait été corrompu de manière irrécupérable sur le Holonet récemment. Il semble que l'alliance soit prête à déclarer qu'Antares n'est rien d'autre qu'un territoire militaire."

1946, "Escadrille Alpha, sachez que nous avons modifié votre trajectoire de vol. Dirigez-vous directement vers votre nouveau cap. Toute déviation sera un motif d'interception et d'arrestation immédiate."

1947, "Un territoire militaire ? Mais cela ne signifierait-il pas que certains actifs locaux restent au pouvoir ?"

1948, "Pas dans ce cas. J'ai entendu dire que l'Alliance veut simplement reprendre le contrôle total d'Antares pour les ressources et qu'à ce titre, il serait sous le contrôle direct de la Délégation Commerciale de la GTA"

1949, "La Délégation Commerciale n'est pas équipée pour traiter les problèmes présents ici."

1950, "C'est pourquoi les locaux ne sont pas vraiment enthousiastes à cette idée."

1951, "Quels sont les problèmes auxquels le gouvernement local est confronté ?"

1952, "Surtout de la contrebande. Mais le Marteau de la Lumière cause parfois des problèmes aux convois et aux habitants de l'extérieur."

1953, "Oui, Antares est une plaque tournante pour le transport de la drogue, de l'argent sale et de toute autre contrebande à laquelle vous pouvez penser entre les systèmes centraux et les colonies extérieures. On dit que le gouvernement local est tellement corrompu qu'il n'essaie même pas d'y mettre fin."

1954, "L'Alliance n'a-t-elle pas de représentants au sein du Haut Conseil d'Antarès ?"

1955, "Les titulaires commandités par la GTA ont une cote d'approbation pratiquement inexistante. La plupart pensent qu'ils n'ont obtenu des sièges auparavant qu'en raison de la présence des Vasudiens et des Shiviens. Maintenant qu'ils ne sont plus une menace, les gens d'ici les voient comme des traîtres."

1956, "*soupir* Bien reçu, Psi."

1957, "Mayday! Station Antares, ici le convoi terrien trois-neuf-bravo. Nous avons été touchés par des raiders et avons subi de gros dégâts. Demandons une escorte."

1958, "Convoi terrien, nous vous recevons. L'escorte est en route. Quelle est votre situation ?"

1959, "Escadrille Psi, veuillez intercepter et escorter le convoi."

1960, "Les raiders nous ont attaqués à notre point de saut. Pendant la procédure de distorsion, notre cargaison a été arrachée de ses attaches. Nos pinces de quai sont sévèrement endommagées."

1961, "En route pour formation d'escorte."

1962, "Convoi Terrien, GTD Intrepid. Où se trouve votre escorte ? Aucun transport ou cargo ne doit voler seul selon l'ordre général 13."

1963, "Aucune escorte n'a été assignée, comme d'habitude. Que se passe-t-il ici ?"

1964, "Station Antares, vous ignorez les ordres. Pourquoi les escortes ne sont-elles pas affectées à vos convois dans ce système ?"

1965, "Nous n'avons pas les ressources nécessaires ici, Intrepid. Ce n'est pas Delta Serpentis. Nous devons travailler avec ce que nous avons."

1966, "Alors réduisez le nombre de convois actifs. Ces raiders prospèrent parce que vous leur facilitez la tâche. Nous allons rédiger un rapport sur cet incident."

1967, "Rédigez donc votre rapport et laissez-nous travailler. Nous avons du trafic en approche."

1968, "Escadrille Alpha, l'Amiral a ordonné que vous vérifiez le contenu et les fournitures dans le dépôt de construction."

1969, "Bien reçu, Intrepid. Nous procédons au scan de la cargaison."

1970, "Escadrille Psi, quel est votre statut ? Nous avons un cargo inconnu en approche. Pas de réponse."

1971, "Nous sommes encore à plusieurs km. Alpha, vous devez prendre celui-ci."

1972, "Alpha, rapprochez-vous du cargo et tentez de les provoquer à bout portant. Nous avons restauré vos postcombustibles."

1973, "Cargo inconnu, ici escadrille Alpha du 47e Egorgeurs. Vous avez ordre d'éteindre vos moteurs et de vous identifier."

1974, "Pas de réponse. Station Antares, avons-nous la permission d'engager ?"

1975, "Alpha, nous voulons que ce cargo soit capturé. Vous n'avez pas d'armes disruptives, donc vous devrez les retenir jusqu'à ce que Psi puisse vous aider. Alpha 3 et 4, protégez le dépôt. 1 et 2, tirez des coups de semonce jusqu'à ce qu'ils s'arrêtent."

1976, "Beau travail Alpha. Restez près du dépôt, nous avons d'autres ordres pour vous."

1977, "Escadrille Alpha, le convoi est sécurisé. Nous sommes en route pour aider."

1978, "Ce type a des couilles. Il va ralentir, mais il ne s'arrêtera pas."

1979, "Reçu. Tenez-le éloigné du dépôt aussi longtemps que possible. S'il s'approche trop, détruisez-le."

1980, "Station Antares, le cargo poursuit son cap initial. Il nous ignore."

1981, "Endommagez-le, mais essayez de ne pas détruire le cargo."

1982, "Escadrille Psi, utilisez vos disrupteurs et tirez sur les moteurs. Amenez-le. Alpha, désengagez."

1983, "C'est assez proche. Escadrille Alpha, descendez ce cargo. On ramassera les morceaux plus tard."

1984, "Cargo désactivé. Envoyez un transport pour le remorquer."

1985, "Alpha 1, faites un scan de ce cargo. Nous aimerions vérifier son origine et ses données IFF."

1986, "Escadrille Psi, nous avons de multiples vecteurs en approche, tous hostiles. On dirait qu'ils se dirigent vers le dépôt de ravitaillement. Pas de réponse aux appels. Les codes IFF ne sont pas clairs. Répondez, s'il vous plaît."

1987, "Psi, répondez s'il vous plaît. Ciblez et engagez les hostiles. Je répète, ciblez et engagez. Le premier cargo était une ruse. Lancez la postcombustion et protégez la cargaison."

1988, "Station Antares, répétez. Répondez. Pas reçu."

1989, "Merde !"

1990, "Merde ! C'est un sac frag n' bag. Psi 3 et 4 protégez la marchandise. Psi 2, vous êtes avec moi. On y va !"

1991, "Escadrille Alpha, nous avons besoin de votre aide. Défendez le dépôt et détruisez tout transporteur non autorisé."

1992, "Station Antares, ici le groupe de cargo Victor Deux. Nous sommes dans les temps pour le chargement du ravitaillement."

1993, "Bien reçu. Vous êtes autorisé à procéder."

1994, "Négatif Alpha. N'engagez pas les cargos. Ce sont des cibles civiles enregistrées. Vous n'avez pas l'autorité de prendre des mesures hostiles."

1995, "Intrepid ! Ces raiders mettent en sac de précieuses fournitures destinées aux planètes du pourtour. Nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre cette perte."

1996, "Nous sommes des représentants de la GTA à Antares, nous ne pouvons tout simplement pas agir sur des cibles civiles sans l'autorisation du Haut Commandement. Alpha, attendez."

1997, "Très bien Alpha. Engagez le combat avec des vaisseaux hostiles. Cependant, nous aimerions réduire le nombre de morts au minimum. Si vous engagez des cargos, essayez d'abord de les désarmer ou de les mettre hors service."

1998, "Alpha 1, il y a plusieurs cargos que nous avons marqués sur votre radar. Nous aimerions que vous en scanniez un et que vous les laissiez partir en distorsion. Nous les suivrons jusqu'à leur destination."

1999, "Beau travail Alpha 1. Cela nous aidera à trouver leur point de rendez-vous."

2000, "Station Antares, la zone est sécurisée."

2001, "Bien reçu Psi. Bon, on ramasse les morceaux. Commencez à compter les conteneurs manquants. Nous allons envoyer une équipe pour évaluer les dégâts."

2002, "Escadrille Alpha, veuillez évacuer la zone pendant que nous réglons cette affaire."

2003, "Alpha, il semble que nous soyons sur le chemin ici. Amenez-le et nous allons poursuivre ces cargos."

2004, "$SnailTemp escargots trouvés !"

2005, "Psi, nous détectons plusieurs autres chasseurs hostiles en approche. Protégez toutes les cargaisons que vous pouvez, les cargos devront attendre."

2006, "Station Antares, nous subissons des dégâts. Veuillez nous couvrir !"

2007, "Intrepid, le deuxième convoi de transport est en route."

2008, "Alpha, il semble que nous soyons sur le chemin ici. Amenez-le."

2009, "Alpha, vous avez désobéi aux ordres ! Nous voulions que ce cargo soit capturé. Retournez à la base."

L'opération échoue car les principales preuves ont déjà été transportées à travers l'espace vasudien vers Regulus."

2023, "Grâce à vos scanners, nous avons pu suivre les cargos jusqu'à $y Antares $y VII$| . Nous avons leurs coordonnées, et le $b Commandement veut que nous envoyions une formation pour poursuivre et capturer les vaisseaux avant qu'ils ne puissent s'échapper à nouveau."

2026, "Les capteurs longue portée indiquent que trois cargos qui nous ont échappé sont restés inactifs pendant l'heure écoulée. Ils pourraient être en train de se ravitailler en carburant ou tenter un transfert de cargaison, ce qui suggère la présence d'un dépôt de cargaison ou d'une installation de fortune. Nous nous attendons également à ce  qu'ils aient fait appel à une protection supplémentaire après leur dernière rencontre. Dans cette optique, l'escadrille $b Alpha sera déployée pour évaluer la situation et procéder à une frappe préliminaire si nécessaire."

2028, "$b Escadrille $b Alpha$| , vos objectifs sont de déterminer la nature de l'escale des contrebandiers, de nettoyer la zone d'éventuels chasseurs et de désactiver les cargos ou les transports que vous y rencontrerez. Choisissez votre armement en conséquence. Nous surveillerons la situation et, si nécessaire, nous déploierons l'$b escadrille $b Delta pour vous assister."

2031, "Notre objectif était de collecter des renseignements qui nous auraient permis de remonter jusqu'aux employeurs des contrebandiers. Pour cela, nous devions préserver autant que possible leur réseau jusqu'à ce que nous ayons eu la possibilité de faire passer notre analyse au $b Commandement$| . Je comprends que vous soyez très stressé, mais je n'ai pas d'autre choix que de vous retirer de la liste de vol en attendant une évaluation psychologique. Rompez."

2032, "Ne détruisez pas les cargos ou les conteneurs de fret avant qu'ils n'aient été scannés. N'ordonnez pas non plus à vos ailiers de les attaquer.  "

2033, "Compte tenu de l'initiative des contrebandiers d'abandonner le dépôt, il s'agissait d'un petit miracle que le $r Benedict et ses compagnons se soient présentés à ce moment-là. Cependant, cette piste possible a été perdue aujourd'hui lorsque nous avons échoué à désactiver le transport pour la capture."

2034, "Allez-y minutieusement avec le transport. Visez le sous-système moteur en ciblant le transport et en appuyant sur la touche S jusqu'à ce qu'il soit sélectionné. De plus, utilisez une arme qui endommage les sous-systèmes avec un minimum de dommages collatéraux, comme le SDG Akheton."

2035, "Si l'abandon de l'installation a été une déception, l'arrivée opportune du $r Benedict et de sa compagnie de hors-la-loi a plus que compensé. Officieusement, deux des passagers du $r Benedict se sont révélés être des membres du personnel des représentants de $y Regulus au Sénat. Ce lien entre les représentants de $y Regulus et le réseau de contrebande de $y Antares pourrait menacer la $b GTA$| . Les locaux se sentent déjà privés de leurs droits avec un gouvernement en difficulté. Nous n'avons pas besoin qu'une nouvelle couche de corruption fasse surface."

2036, "La préservation d'une partie du fret que les cargos qui accompagnaient le $r Benedict ont largué est une aubaine supplémentaire pour notre $b Unité d'$b Enquête $b Criminelle$| . Vous avez bien agi en le protégeant."

2037, "La deuxième vague de contrebandiers a réussi à détruire la cargaison que le $r Benedict avait apportée dans la zone. Le contenu de ces conteneurs aurait permis de mieux comprendre l'ampleur de la corruption à laquelle nous sommes confrontés."

2038, "Seuls Vargi 3 et Vargi 4 s'attaqueront aux deux conteneurs de fret largués. Chaque chasseur choisira une cible différente. Les deux conteneurs sont sur votre liste d'escorte, et les deux chasseurs peuvent être ciblés rapidement en appuyant sur F8. Ordonnez à vos ailiers d'engager un des chasseurs pendant que vous prenez l'autre si nécessaire.

N'oubliez pas que le transport Benedict est une priorité absolue."

2070, "Les cargos semblent relativement intacts. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de débris ici. On dirait qu'il n'y a pas eu de combat, alors je me demande ce qui les a effrayés."

2071, "Avec un peu de chance, nous. Ce serait agréable de savoir que quelqu'un a été intimidé par nous, pour une fois, plutôt que l'inverse."

$b * $b Système $b Deneb
$b * $b 08/03/36

$b Nouveaux $b Ordres

Je suis le $b Vice-Amiral $b d'escadre $b Tighe$| . l'$b Amiral $b Po m'a demandé de clarifier très brièvement une partie de la confusion concernant notre récent changement de cap. Comme certains d'entre vous l'ont peut-être entendu, nous avons reçu l'ordre de nous rendre à $y Beta $y Aquilae pour renforcer le groupe du Contre-Amiral Jian contre les 'menaces locales'. Cependant, l'$b Amiral $b Po estime qu'il s'agit, au mieux, d'une mauvaise utilisation des ressources limitées de la $b GTA$| , et au pire, d'une mauvaise orientation délibérée. l'$b Amiral $b Po craint que certaines figures d'autorité de la GTA ne se désespèrent maintenant que nous sommes sur les réseaux de contrebande $y Antares-Regulus$| .

l'$b Amiral n'a pas l'intention de mettre fin à nos opérations contre les réseaux de crime organisé qui se répandent dans ces systèmes. Nous préparons une mission à $y Regulus qui, nous l'espérons, frappera au cœur même de ces mystérieux syndicats. Pour éviter les accusations d'insubordination pure et simple, l'$b Amiral $b Po a informé le Commandement que nous ne nous rendrons à $y Beta $y Aquilae qu'après une remise en état indispensable à $y Sirius$| "

2117, "À 0341, les stations de détection ont repéré une escadrille de quatre chasseurs Thoth juste à l'extérieur du portail de saut de $y Sirius$| . Ils n'ont pas répondu à nos appels, et le $b Commandement n'a pas connaissance de forces $b PVN amies dans cette zone. Le $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière $r (HoL) a été complètement battu à $y Deneb au cours des dernières années. Cependant, un vrai fanatique ne sait jamais quand il doit abandonner. Si ces chasseurs sont une unité d'avant-garde d'un assaut, aujourd'hui pourrait voir la première action sérieuse de l'$g Intrepid contre le $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière depuis la $b Grande $b Guerre$| ."

Il y a longtemps que beaucoup d'entre nous n'ont pas affronté cet ennemi. Pour certains d'entre vous, ce sera une première. Quelle que soit votre expérience, nous savons tous de quoi le $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière est capable, et nous savons jusqu'où ils iront pour leur cause. Montez dans vos chasseurs immédiatement."

2121, "l'$g Intrepid est arrivé en un seul morceau à $y Sirius à 0430 heures standard grâce à vos efforts. La présence du $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière aujourd'hui a été la plus forte depuis des années, mais nous l'avons repoussée.

Avant cette rencontre, le $r Capitaine $r de $r frégate $r Ozymandias et son destroyer le $r Cardinal étaient inconnus de la flotte. l'$b Amiral $b Po a demandé un briefing complet sur $r Ozymandias et ses forces au $b Commandement$| ."

2122, "Les forces du $r Marteau $r de $r la $r Lumière $r (HoL) sous le $r Capitaine $r de $r frégate $r Ozymandias ont réussi à nous détourner de notre objectif. Leur victoire ici, remportée par un fanatique religieux arrogant mais charismatique, pourrait être un signe avant-coureur des choses à venir. Encouragés par leur victoire contre l'$g Intrepid et l'$b Amiral $b Po aujourd'hui, les $r HoL vont probablement frapper viscéralement leurs ennemis à $y Deneb et les systèmes voisins. Notre échec n'est peut-être que le début."

2123, "Les bombardiers lancés par le Cardinal sont des cibles relativement faciles.

Concentrez la plupart de vos efforts sur la défense de vos bombardiers. Permettez-leur de faire leur travail en leur ouvrant la voie. Votre but ultime est de repousser le Marteau de la Lumière avant qu'ils ne repoussent ou ne détruisent l'Intrepid. C'est une course aux dégâts."

En réponse à l'implication présumée de fonctionnaires du gouvernement dans des réseaux criminels régionaux, l'$b Amiral $b Po souhaite recueillir davantage de renseignements sur l'étendue de la corruption. À cette fin, nous avons été chargés de capturer les $B Sénateurs $B Hoshi $B et $B Jacobsen$| , les représentants de $y Regulus à l'Assemblée Générale. Nos informations indiquent qu'ils sont actuellement en route pour la colonie de Naritz et que leur arrivée est imminente, nous devons donc agir rapidement. 

Nous avons besoin des sénateurs et de leur personnel en vie, et nous n'aurons pas de meilleures chances de les capturer que lorsqu'ils sont en transit. Nous intercepterons les deux transports avant qu'ils n'atteignent la colonie. Comme vous le savez sans doute, cette opération n'est ni connue ni approuvée par les pouvoirs judiciaire et exécutif. Il s'agit donc d'une mission secrète et classifiée. Vous ne parlerez pas de cette opération en dehors de cette salle."

2186, "Nos sources indiquent que les sénateurs et leur personnel sont à bord des transports de classe Proton $r Cross $r Creek et $r Tranquility$|. Ils voyagent au sein d'un convoi plus important en direction de la colonie de Naritz.

2272, "Bon retour à $y Sirius$|, pilotes. L'$g Intrepid est toujours en cale sèche, et nous devons repartir dans trois jours. En attendant, nous avons quelque chose de spécial pour vous. Lors d'une récente table ronde avec le $b Commandement $b vasudien$| , nous avons appris que le $b Lt. $b Sermakh, un agent de la PVN$| , travaillait sous couverture au sein du $r HoL$| . Il a recueilli des informations prioritaires sur les opérations du $r HoL dans plusieurs systèmes. On nous dit qu'il a risqué sa couverture pour obtenir ces informations, et la $b PVN de l'extraire."

2273, "Lt. Sermakh"

2274, "En raison de la menace croissante de la menace du $r HoL à $y Antares$| , l'$b Amiral $b Po veut ces informations. Le $b Lt. $b Sermakh se trouve à bord de l'installation $r Khayu$| , une ancienne installation de la $b PVN sur $y Alpha $y Centauri$| , qui a été capturée au début de la révolte du $r HoL$|. La station est fortement défendue et l'extraction de l'agent ne sera pas une tâche facile. Le $b Renseignement $b vasudien n'a pas d'agents dans le système, et votre expérience au sein de la $r GTI vous rend qualifié pour cette tâche.

L'$b Amiral $b Po sait que vous êtes à la hauteur, et la $b PVN a accepté son offre. Le $b 47e entre en jeu."

C'est essentiel pour le succès de la mission. Vous êtes envoyés sous couverture. Le $g PVD $g Frontier jouera l'appât. Avec une cible aussi critique dans leur propre arrière-cour, le $r HoL devrait mordre à l'hameçon et sortir une formation d'attaque. Votre travail consistera à traquer une escadrille de Thoths et à prendre leur place. $B Vous $B ne $B serez $B pas $B déployés $B tant $B que $B les $B Thoths $B ne $B seront $B pas $B dans $B la $B zone$| . Vous devrez voler leurs codes IFF et les détruire avant qu'ils n'entrent dans le sous-espace. Vous aurez un temps limité pour les abattre, alors terminez le travail dans le sous-espace si vous le devez."

2278, "Thoths"

2279, "Vos Thoths ont été modifiés pour un usage terrien. Ils ont été équipés d'un mécanisme de déploiement et sont chargés de cinq charges à distance. Cela a un coût. Vous n'aurez aucune contre-mesure et peu de munitions secondaires."

2280, "Il s'agit d'un cambriolage avec effraction. Une fois que vous êtes arrivé, déployez les charges. $b Alpha $b 1$|, vous devez déposer vos charges près de la baie de chasseurs. Cela devrait nécessiter trois charges, alors utilisez à votre discrétion celles qui restent. $b Alpha $b 2 prendra les communications et $b Alpha $b 3 déploiera ses charges près de tout croiseur hostile dans la zone. Sachez que les charges $W doivent $W être $W à $W moins $W de $W 150m du sous-système visé."

2282, "Le $b Lt. $b Sermakh est chargé de s'échapper de l'installation par tous les moyens possibles. Il vous contactera quand il sera prêt. Une fois qu'il sera sorti, faites exploser les charges et escortez le $b Lt. $b Sermakh jusqu'à son départ. Nous vous recommandons de $W rester $W à $W moins $W de $W 1500 $W mètres du vaisseau du $b Lt. $b Sermakh pour assurer sa sécurité.

L'aide est extrêmement limitée sur ce coup et le timing est crucial. Si quelque chose tourne mal, nous devrons probablement interrompre la mission. Bonne chance."

2291, "Veillez à ne pas tirer avant d'en avoir reçu l'ordre."

2292, "$r Aries a survécu assez longtemps pour avertir le $r HLI $r Khayu que vous étiez des imposteurs. Cela a suffi pour éveiller les soupçons sur vous et votre escadrille."

2294, "Vous vous êtes trop approché de l'$r escadrille $r Cancer$| . Il est probable qu'ils aient remarqué que des Terriens pilotaient le vaisseau vasudien. Cela a éveillé les soupçons sur vous et votre escadrille."

2298, "Le $r HoL n'a pas cru à cette ruse. Il n'y avait pas grand-chose de plus à faire une fois qu'ils nous ont pris au dépourvu."

2299, "Vous avez reçu l'ordre explicite de déposer suffisamment de charges près de la baie de chasseurs pour la détruire. Vous avez désobéi à ces ordres. Il n'y avait aucun moyen de sauver le $b Lt. $b Sermak alors que le $r Khayu lançait des escadrilles de chasseurs."

2302, "Essayez de ne pas faire exploser les charges tant que vous n'en avez pas reçu l'ordre."

2303, "Vous n'avez pas réussi à protéger le $b Lt. $b Sermak$| . C'est un coup dur dans nos efforts pour contenir la menace du $r HoL$| . Vous êtes un pilote bien entraîné, et nous attendions mieux de vous."

2304, "Essayez de larguer des charges près de différents sous-systèmes du Khayu pour obtenir un effet différent. Lorsque les chasseurs arrivent, restez près du vaisseau de Sermak pour le protéger.

De plus, essayez de rester à moins de 1500m du vaisseau de Sermak afin de le protéger."

2305, "Le $g Camden n'a pas survécu. Malgré les revers, vous auriez dû être en mesure de fournir une couverture. Les forces du $r HoL ouvraient le feu dans tout le système. Nous n'avions plus de transports à envoyer."

2307, "En outre, nous n'avons pas réussi à obtenir les informations du $b Lt. $b Sermak$| . Il transportait des données vitales sur les opérations et les emplacements du $r HoL dans l'espace terrien et vasudien, qui auraient pu nous aider à les attirer et à les vaincre. Vous êtes en partie responsable de cet échec. Rompez."

These weapons are highly effective against fighters, bombers and even light cruisers. It works by launching explosive shells at a high rate of fire toward incoming targets. These shells explode near simultaneously creating a defensive screen of concussive blasts. This will enable fighter patrols to focus on bombers while the flak targets incoming warheads.

Additionally, long range scans indicate $B{ the immediate area around the station is currently not jump $} $B capable$| . We suspect the explosion released heavy solid and gaseous debris into the area, effectively cutting off immediate subspace access."

2461, "(fr)Unknown"

2462, "(fr)IFF Transponder"

2463, "(fr)Pilots, the situation is critical. You may have already heard that the $b GTA has recently been forced to lift all subspace node travel restrictions. This marks the first time in ten years that ships can cross into $y Antares undocumented. What this means for us today is that traffic through $y Antares$| , specifically to the only major fuel hub in the system, $b Antares $b Station$| , has increased twenty-fold."

2465, "(fr)Beta Cygni"

2466, "(fr)Ribos"

2467, "(fr)Beta Aquilae"

2468, "(fr)We have detected and contacted more than five convoys en route to $b Antares $b Station with more likely on their way. They have been redirected to the $W IFF $W transponders and instructed to wait there for further orders. We have no reason to suspect hostile intent at this time. However, given the recently discovered deal between local $r smugglers and the $r Hammer $r of $r Light$| , we need to be cautious."

2469, "(fr)Convoy"

2470, "(fr)To that end, we are deploying $g Alpha and $g Beta wings to the transponder's location. There you will assess the situation and make local contact with $g Antares $g Station$| , if possible. You will also be responsible for all convoy traffic that enters the area."

2471, "(fr)Beta"

2472, "(fr)The $g Intrepid is prepping for a possible battle situation by bringing the new $B flak $B weaponry online. Once those modifications are complete and its jump drives are charged, the $g Intrepid will proceed toward $g Antares $g Station$| . Again, we do not suspect hostile intent. However, the $b Admiral doesn't want us to get caught with our pants on the floor. Should the situation escalate, reinforcements will be made available."

2473, "(fr)We lost more than two-thirds of the civilian craft that entered $y Antares today despite our best efforts. The $r Hammer $r of $r Light likely planned this terrorist attack for months. They knew exactly how to hit us and how to make it count."

2474, "(fr)The $r HoL was aware of our rally points almost as soon as they were set up. This suggests a much greater $r HoL presence in $y Antares than we previously believed. The fact that the $r HoL has been able to mass produce a $B{ new kind of Vasudan-Shivan hybrid bomber $} is also frightening. $b Vasudan $b Intelligence is calling this bomber the $r Sekhmet$| . It is a highly dangerous craft, so prioritize them if you encounter them again."

2475, "(fr)$g Antares $g Station$| , STX Exploration, Mekhu Enterprises and Whiteside Construction have all lodged formal complaints with GTA Command. Many of the freighters and transports lost today were carrying passengers or materials for these companies and likely others. The $b Admiral thinks this entire operation was the $r HoL's way of making a political point, but most think it was just another one of their terrorist plots. Either way, they have shown an unexpected interest in $y Antares$| . It's unlikely that we've seen the last of these attacks."

2476, "(fr)You abandoned your post during a tense operation. You are a coward and a disgrace. You are grounded until further notice, pilot."

2477, "(fr)You were given command over the situation out there, pilot. You chose which ships to prioritize and protect. However, you failed to do even that. Your inability to protect even a few ships forced us to pull you from active duty. It will be a long time before you pilot a fighter again. Dimissed!"

2520, "(fr)Beta, one of our construction depots exploded sending volitile materials throughout the area. It's causing massive communications and subspace distortion. Do you read?"

2522, "(fr)Standby, Gripsholm."

2526, "(fr)Copy that, Beta. We are setting up a safe rally point for convoys in the area. Hold position. We'll transmit the rally point coordinates when the location has been secured."

2527, "(fr)Transport Gripsholm, our orders are to hold position here until a secure rally point can be established elsewhere in the system. What is your cargo and destination?"

2528, "(fr)Alpha, we are inbound from Beta Aquilae en route to the Betelgeuse system. We are mostly carrying passengers, people who intend to join up with the mining operations out there"

2529, "(fr)We need to refuel and resupply before we can make the jump to Beta Cygni."

2530, "(fr)Alpha wing. This is Phi 1, Antares Security. We're just having a bit of local interference at the station. We are working on clearing the debris now. What's the situation?"

2531, "(fr)Phi, we've got multiple civilian vessels en route to this location. We can't risk a smuggler raid. A secure rally point is being setup elsewhere, until then we need to get these transports moved to a more secure location."

2532, "(fr)Our best option is to make way toward Antares Station. Comm traffic with the station is limited to exteremely short range. We'll contact the station. Then we'll return to assist with the escort."

2533, "(fr)Alright. Gripsholm, power up and make way toward the station. Further instructions will be given en route."

2534, "(fr)Thrilling. We return from a borng tour in Sirius just to play the role of traffic cops in Antares."

2535, "(fr)Let's form up on the convoy and hope it stays just as quiet. These boats don't have a lot of plating."

2536, "(fr)What the hell? My sensors just wacked out!"

2537, "(fr)Someone's using an ECM jammer!"

2538, "(fr)Alright we've got incoming, nine o' clock. Could be another convoy, but something's not right here... Beta One, can you check it out?"

2539, "(fr)I've got visual on nine Vasudan craft. Shit! Weapons hot! It must be Hammer of Light."

2540, "(fr)Dammit, Beta One is down! Alpha, intercept those fighters, we'll cover the convoy."

2541, "(fr)Hang tight, Alpha. We are heading your way to assist."

2542, "(fr)Sensors are back online!"

2543, "(fr)Command, we've been engaged by the Hammer of Light. Please advise."

2544, "(fr)Protect the convoy, pilots. The Intrepid is making final adjustments to the Flak system. It will jump to your location when the modifications are complete."

2545, "(fr)We're tracking a small mining fleet on route to the transponder. Secure the area as quickly as possible."

2546, "(fr)This is the GTSC Tully, we've emerged into a hostile situation with HoL forces. Please advise."

2547, "(fr)Tully, have your group set course for Antares Station. We'll cover you."

2548, "(fr)They've retreated! I doubt they've given up, though. Let's form up."

2549, "(fr)Command, we're stuck in an ugly situation out here. There's no way we'll be able to protect every ship on this route."

2550, "(fr)We're working with our fleet throughout the system. Standby."

2551, "(fr)This is the PVT Okpara. Our destination is Antares Station, however, we have been routed to this location. Please provide instructions."

2552, "(fr)Okpara, you may proceed to Antares Station. Be advised that we have just been attacked by the Hammer of Light and we do expect them to return."

2553, "(fr)Stay in a tight formation. We'll cover you as best we can."

2554, "(fr)Acknowleged, Alpha."

2555, "(fr)Pilots, the Intrepid has been engaged by Hammer of Light forces. We cannot assist until the Intrepid has resolved its engagement."

2556, "(fr)Captain Matheney of the GTC Tunisien and Captain Bosch of the GTC Algerien are securing two separate rally points for us. We will advise you when they are ready."

2557, "(fr)Alpha 1, we are giving you direct operational control. You will need to choose which convoys are of the highest priority and take appropriate actions to defend them."

2558, "(fr)We've detected and informed seven more civilian groups en route to your location. Your computer will automatically group them together. Target one craft and add it to your escort list and your computer will add the rest in the group."

2559, "(fr)Pilots, we are now responsible for hundreds of lives. The Admiral expects you to perform as such."

2560, "(fr)Copy that, Command."

2561, "(fr)Alpha 1, you need to choose which convoy group to prioritize."

2562, "(fr)One, if you don't choose quickly, I'll do it for you."

2563, "(fr)I don't understand your indecision, One... I've selected a group. Everyone form up."

2564, "(fr)Alright guys, prioritized convoys will marked with yellow on your HUD. All others will be marked by orange."

2565, "(fr)Protect as many ships as you can, but those marked in yellow are to take highest priority. Phi, are you onboard with that?"

2566, "(fr)Alpha, you need to understand that we don't fall under your authority. Our priority will always be for convoys carrying a large number of passengers and personnel. We suggest you do the same."

2567, "(fr)With all due respect, Phi, we have abs--"

2568, "(fr)Heads up, three HoL gunships with escort have emerged from subspace."

2569, "(fr)Looks like they are trying to head us off. If those gunships get in range of the convoys, they'll rip them apart."

2570, "(fr)We'll stay here and protect the convoy. Beta, go see about scrapping those Newets."

2571, "(fr)Alpha, the HoL has destroyed too many civilian ships! We're pulling you out. Zeta wing will be taking over this escort."

2572, "(fr)Zeta wing here, assuming escort. Alpha wing, you have been ordered to return to base."

2573, "(fr)Dammit Alpha, we need your help up here!"

2574, "(fr)Alpha, are you even trying?"

2575, "(fr)Heads up. They've sent in Osiris class bombers. Their warheads are a severe threat to the convoys."

2576, "(fr)Pilots, the GTC Tunisien is reporting that it has secured the area as best it can. Captain Matheney says he can protect up to ten ships."

2577, "(fr)Copy, Command. PVT Okpara, GTSC Tully. I'm transmitting the cooridinates now. You need to depart immiediately before more Hammer of Light arrives."

2578, "(fr)Powering up subspace drive."

2579, "(fr)Departing now."

2580, "(fr)The GTC Tunisien is reporting that the convoys have arrived. Sweep the area, pilots. We are tracking more civilians inbound."

2581, "(fr)Mayday! Mayday! This is the PVFr Atsu. The Hammer of Light has tracked us through subspace. We are taking heavy damage. We will emerge near the transponder momentarily. Please assist!"

2582, "(fr)Copy, Command. PVT Okpara, TT Gripsholm. I'm transmitting the cooridinates now. You need to depart immiediately before more Hammer of Light arrives."

2583, "(fr)Alpha, we are going to stay under Phi's escort and try to make it to the station."

2584, "(fr)Acknowledged, Gripsholm. GTSC Tully, that means your group will warp to the rally point."

2585, "(fr)Copy, Command. GTSC Tully, TT Gripsholm. I'm transmitting the cooridinates now. You need to depart immiediately before more Hammer of Light arrives."

2586, "(fr)Acknowledged, Gripsholm. PVT Okpara, that means your group will warp to the rally point."

2587, "(fr)Pilots, we're tracking three more convoys that should arrive near the transponder in approximately one minute. You need to get back there quickly."

2588, "(fr)Go ahead, Alpha. We'll cover this convoy all the way to the station. Then we'll return to assist you further."

2589, "(fr)Alpha, Beta. Reform on the civ boats. Don't let these bastards distract you!"

2590, "(fr)Dammit! We won't get there in time!"

2591, "(fr)Alpha, if you can't protect prioritized ships then we can't keep you out there! We're replacing you with Zeta wing. Return to base."

2592, "(fr)The convoy is secure. We're moving back towards the transponder."

2593, "(fr)Command, this is not going to work. There is no way we can protect this many ships at these distances. We need some help out here!"

2594, "(fr)Alright, pilots. Standby. The Intrepid has secured the area and--"

2595, "(fr)Mayday! This is Captain Matheney. Command, we have been engaged by the HoL. They hav--TRANSMISSION LOST"

2596, "(fr)Standby. We are going to confirm the status of our rally points."

2597, "(fr)We need a new strategy. There is no way we can protect this many ships the distances to Antares Station."

2598, "(fr)The best plan is to form a tight formation right here until reinforcements arrive."

2599, "(fr)Beta, we've reviewed the situation. Admiral Po agrees with your assessment. Captain Bosch reported heavy casualties caused by some kind of Vasudan-Shivan hybrid bomber. No response from Captain Matheney."

2600, "(fr)Get the transports into the formation. The Intrepid will arrive in several minutes. Stay ready, pilots. The HoL's plans to do not often include simply harrassing civilian targets. "

2601, "(fr)What the hell? I thought those rally points were secured, command!"

2602, "(fr)Alpha wing, we have arrived. We were informed en route of the situation. Please provide escort."

2603, "(fr)Kek, you are more than 10 clicks from the transponder!"

2604, "(fr)This is freighter GTA-Niner-Eight-Five-Golf. We've departed subspace early as ordered."

2605, "(fr)This is the PVT Aapep. We have arrived at the assigned coordinates. Please advise."

2606, "(fr)Transport captains, listen up. I'm transmitting coordinates to place you in a zama-three formation."

2607, "(fr)Those boats are wide open until we get them together. We need to split up and cover them. Alpha 1, which convoy should we cover?"

2608, "(fr)Alright. Alpha, form up on the freighters. Phi?"

2609, "(fr)We'll cover the Aapep's group."

2610, "(fr)Beta, that leaves the Kek's group for you. Stay sharp."

2611, "(fr)Alright. Alpha, form up on the PVSC Kek and it's group. Phi?"

2612, "(fr)Beta, that leaves the freighters for you. Stay sharp."

2613, "(fr)Alright. Alpha, form up on the PVT Aapep and it's group. Phi?"

2614, "(fr)We'll cover the Kek's group."

2615, "(fr)Here they come!"

2616, "(fr)Heads up, Alpha! Saggitarius is trying to ram the freighters."

2617, "(fr)Guys, Libra is trying to disable the transports. Destroy them before the transports are stalled and picked off one by one!"

2618, "(fr)Look out! Pisces is targetting the transports with warheads. Take down those bombs, fast!"

2619, "(fr)GTA pilots, this is the Gergen. We've arrived at the assigned coordinates."

2620, "(fr)Gergen, we are under siege by Hammer of Light forces. We are placing all transports into a tight formation until the area is secure."

2621, "(fr)You mean you haven't secured the area, yet?"

2622, "(fr)We are doing the best we can. The Intrepid should arrive in just a few minutes. That ought to deter any further HoL attack."

2623, "(fr)Negative, Alpha. There is no way a few GTA fighters can protect us from the Hammer of Light. We are going to make for the station. Good Luck."

2624, "(fr)He's right. This is not a good idea. We are spread way too thin as it is."

2625, "(fr)So we are letting them go without escort?"

2626, "(fr)We don't have a choice. Stay and protect the formation."

2627, "(fr)Pilots, this is the GTD Intrepid. We are preparing to deploy multiple wings. Standby."

2628, "(fr)Copy, Intrepid. Good to see you!"

2629, "(fr)Hammer of Light cruisers emerging from subspace! Pilots, take them out before they--"

2630, "(fr)That's another ECM burst. Heads up, guys!"

2631, "(fr)The cruisers are focusing on our fighterbay!"

2632, "(fr)Delta wing is down! Delta wing is down inside the bay!"

2633, "(fr)Pilots, the flight deck reports haevy damage. Our fighterbay is currently innoperable. Stay near the transports until we can clear it. We'll handle the cruisers."

2634, "(fr)Pilots, the Intrepid will be arriving momentarily to secure the area. Standby."

2635, "(fr)Oh my god... It's a kill box and we walked right into it! I knew this wasn't a good idea."

2636, "(fr)It's about time! I'm not sure we could hold off any further attacks."

2637, "(fr)Isn't it a little early to start celebrating?"

2638, "(fr)Why's that? The most powerful ship in Antares in moments away. I seriously doubt the HoL is bold enough to attack now."

2639, "(fr)What the hell are those?"

2640, "(fr)Those craft match the profile of the bombers that took out our rally points. Destroy them quickly, pilots!"

2641, "(fr)Those bombers are staying clear of our weapons. Try to lure them in range of the flak guns."

2642, "(fr)Pilots, the flight deck has been cleared. We are scrambling Gamma, Epsilon, and Theta wings to assist."

2643, "(fr)The HoL is retreating!"

2644, "(fr)Dammit, Intrepid! What the hell happened? Is there any way that your forc--"

2645, "(fr)Phi, save it. Our priority right now it to help secure and clear the area. You can lodge formal complaints later."

2646, "(fr)Alpha and Beta, you are relieved. Return to base for debrief. Gamma, Epsilon, and Theta will take it from here."

2651, "(fr)Hammer's Edict"

2652, "(fr)A high level Vasudan politician is travelling from Beta Aquilae to Vasuda through Antares. The Intrepid is in charge of assisting the Vasudans in protecting the transport. The transport should unexpectedly self-destruct. After that, the HOL should warp in and attempt to capture the remaining transports carrying other Vasudan officials including Khonsu II but they fail."

2653, "(fr)In light of recent $h Hammer $h of $h Light attacks against civilian targets throughout $y Antares and the disappearance of several civilian convoys, $b Admiral $b Po has committed to deploying additional squadrons to protecting transports moving through high-risk areas throughout the system. One such area is the $B Vasuda $B Jump $B Node in $y Antares$| . This area has been the site of intense fighting in recent weeks."

2654, "(fr)The 47th has been called upon to aid in this operation. However, our mission will be of slightly higher importance - $B Ambassador $B Thebes$| , a high-ranking Vasudan politician, is moving from the $b Beta $b Aquilae system to $b Vasuda via $y Antares$| . In order to ensure the convoy's safety, $b Admiral $b Po has committed one fighter wing to augment the Vasudan escort detail."

2655, "(fr)The convoy consists of four Satis transports and $W{ the Ambassador himself will be aboard the $} $W Sheut$| . The convoy is currently holding for a refuelling stop at $g Antares $g Station$| . We'll be joining the convoy on the last leg of their journey before they make the jump to $b Vasuda$| .

$b Alpha $b wing will arrive in the area ahead of the convoy in order to ensure the area is safe prior to their arrival."

2656, "(fr)Be advised, the $h Hammer $h of $h Light has already made numerous death threats against $B Ambassador $B Thebes' life. We have no reason to believe that they will not follow up on this threat. There will be a high probability of hostile contacts in this mission - Be on guard. Terran-Vasudan relations have already been strained in recent months. Your ability to ensure the safety of your charges will reflect heavily on the state of the $f GTA$| . There is no room for error.

Good luck."

2657, "(fr)$b Alpha you abandoned your post during a high priority escort. Suffice to say, the $b Admiral is not impressed. You are confined to quarters until your Court Martial, Pilot."

2658, "(fr)You simply failed to follow order, pilot. Your wingmen are as experienced as you are and you should not take their suggestions lightly. Your actions forced the $r HoL's hand. Because of that, the Ambassador was killed before reinforcements could arrive. You are grounded until further notice. Go wallow in your pride and arrogance!"

2659, "(fr)Unfortunately, there was nothing we could do to save Ambassador Thebes life. The $r Hammer $r of $r Light has continued to outwit all our forces in the past weeks. This is a defeat, but take it in stride, pilots. The $b Admiral will not allow us to be defeated by a group of fanatic terrorists."

2660, "(fr)The $b PVN has yet to issue an official statement on the Ambassador's death. The $b Admiral is hoping this turn of events will force the $b PVN to assist us in our fight against the $r Hammer $r of $r Light$| . Rest assured, he is waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike back. No doubt you will be called upon when the time comes. Get some rest, pilots."

2692, "(fr)Heads up, more hostiles inbound. Looks like a capture team."

2693, "(fr)We have heard the Destroyer's commands! Give us the Ambassador and we might let you limp back to your worthless Admiral."

2694, "(fr)Alpha, our transports have a tight fighter screen. They'll have a hard time getting to the Sheut."

2695, "(fr)Sorry, but if you want the Ambassador, you'll need a larger force than that."

2696, "(fr)Foolish Terrans. Do you not know yours is a mission of failure? You leave us no choice!"

2697, "(fr)They're shooting at us!"

2698, "(fr)To hell with our orders! Warp out!"

2699, "(fr)We can't help them. If we move away from the Sheut, the HoL will surely come after the Ambassador and we can't call for reinforcements."

2701, "(fr)We need to clear this jamming and let Command know what's happening out here."

2702, "(fr)There's no way we can destroy the El Gabal. I think our best option is for me to R-T-B, warn the Intrepid, and hope reinforcements arrive in time."

2703, "(fr)Agreed. Do it."

2704, "(fr)Alright. Try and buy some time!"

$b Our $b situation

As you all know over the last two months, the $r Hammer $r of $r Light has been making advances in $y Antares$| . Their reckless yet methodical operations have pushed us into a corner. Civilian unrest is in a state of escalation as disappearances and engagements have increased over several weeks. Since $r Ozymandias escaped the battle at $y Antares $y VIII$| , we have been unsuccesful in tracking the $r HLD $r Cardinal's locationan and several of our scouting wings have gone missing while attempting to locate it. In accordance with the $b Admiral's orders, all scout patrols are to be recalled until further notice."

2852, "(fr)$b Our $b target

$b Admiral $b Po has informed me that we will soon begin an operation to track down several important figures of local crime organizations. We believe that these organizations have struck a deal with the $r HoL$| , offering remote rallying points and intel in exchange for free passage throughout $y Antares as they move contraband to their drop points. $b Senator $b Hoshi has provided us with the location for several of these drop points."

2853, "(fr)$b Arris $b Gavel

Our objectives are to ascertain the whereabouts of $r Arris $r Gavel or any of his known associates. According to $b Senator $b Hoshi$| , $r Arris $r Gavel was part of a group that dealt with the $r HoL and may have had contact with $r Ozymandias recently in $y Antares$| . Because of our cooperation in $y Alpha $y Centauri$| , the $b PVN has agreed to work with us on this one. The $g PVD $g Frontier will be joining the $g GTD $g Intrepid on the final phase of this operation, where we intend to draw $r Ozymandias out into the open and take him down.

Report to your briefings in four hours."

2854, "(fr)Listen up, pilot. We're sending you on a solo reconnaissance mission around the $b Hastings $b Depot$| . The depot is a moderately busy civilian hub in the outer territories. Because of its location, traffic is expected to be light. Intel suggests that this station is often used to discreetly filter contraband into $y Antares. However given that our intelligence was obtained from an illegally-held senator, the $b GTA has not actually sanctioned this mission. Needless to say, you mustn't be caught."

2855, "(fr)Hastings Depot"

2856, "(fr)This is our best lead, and the $b Admiral expects it will pan out. He's no longer showing any quarter to the $r HoL or their criminal partners, so you're going in under cover. You'll be flying the Loki class fighter developed during the GTI Rebellion. While military outfits have already cracked the Loki's stealth capabilities, we are betting that the low-level security at the depot will still be behind."

2857, "(fr)However, the Loki will only prevent regular sensor lock. They may be low-level security, but they aren't incompetent and can still make contact visually. If they get suspicious, they may try to gain sensor lock with manual in-flight adjustments. You need to avoid their visual range, especially while scanning craft in the area. Use the station to your advantage and try to stay on the opposite side from any security craft."

2858, "(fr)Security Forces"

2859, "(fr)Your objective is to scan any cargo and craft in the area. We first need to ensure that this depot is currently being used to smuggle materials into $y Antares$| . If it is, we can expect that $r Arris $r Gavel or one of his associates may be onboard the station, and we want to track them to their main rallying point. $r Gavel is good, but we want to get whoever's calling the shots. These guys are very efficient at shaking our trackers, so don't raise suspicion or else we can expect $r Gavel to run the circuit."

2860, "(fr)Cargo"

2861, "(fr)Craft"

2862, "(fr)Since this is a pure recon mission, your craft will not be carrying any weapons. Instead, your ship will be loaded with a variety of e-war gear.

Your ship has been equipped with an advanced one-way $b ECM $b sensor $b jammer in your secondary weapons bay. The device will absolutely prevent any sort of possible sensor lock on your ship for a full $b 20 $b seconds, while your own sensors will remain unaffected. The blanking out of their sensors should distract the other pilots from visual observation, and hopefully if they do catch a glance, they will be too busy to consider you any more than another bit of station traffic. However, they will probably become more immediately suspicious with each successive use. Try to use it sparingly. "

2863, "(fr)Instead of primary cannons, your ship carries a small number of $b Force $b CXI $b target $b acquisition $b devices$| . Though the Force bugs are small and inconspicuous, the action of firing the bugs cannot be masked. You are only to deploy $b Force $b CXI devices under direct orders.

Be advised that excessive use of afterburners could make your ship easier to detect, so you may want to stick with unassisted ion drives. Further orders will be given on site. 

Good luck, pilot."

2864, "(fr)Excellent work, pilot! Intelligence is currently tracking the $r Vizier's movments, and we should have a new course of action in a matter of hours. I want you at the head of that operation, so in the meantime rest and unwind a bit."

2865, "(fr)While there was no interesting intel to be found in the containers surrounding the $r Hastings $r Depot$| , your dedication to completeness is impressive. We will continue to track these containers, just in case they may work their way into the wrong hands."

2866, "(fr)Intelligence does not expect to garner any world-shattering revelations from our communication taps, but the fact that you were so dilligent in setting them up is admirable. We'll keep tabs on the ships you scanned and will be able to react quickly if they engage in any suspicious behavior."

2867, "(fr)You failed to get a scan on the $r TGs $r Vizier$| . We had major reasons to believe that $r Arris $r Gavel's movements were the real prize of this operation, yet we did not obtain it. Without that information we cannot yet take effective action against the smuggler menace, and our operations will be set back for weeks at least. 

It is now evident that you are not cut out for special operations, and it is also increasingly clear that you do not belong on the Intrepid. A transfer authorization will be filed very shortly. Pack your things. Dismissed."

2868, "(fr)You need to make a beeline for the Vizier as soon as it gets underway. Ships in your escort list can be cycled by pressing E repeatedly$semicolon this should make it easier to locate the ship."

2869, "(fr)You were detected by the ships around the $r Hastings $r Depot$| . Mercifully, they were not able to identify your fighter as $b GTA$| , but any leads we may have gotten on $r Arris $r Gavel are shot. The Alliance at large will think little of this incident, but our enemies will surely go to ground for weeks at least. Your carelessness cost us perhaps our only real chance to turn the tables on the enemy, and the chaos gripping the $b Alliance will now only grow.

It is now evident that you are not at all cut out for special operations, and it is also increasingly clear that you do not belong on the Intrepid. A transfer authorization will be filed very shortly. Pack your things. Dismissed."

2870, "(fr)Use the hotkeys to keep tabs on the patrolling fighters. They will start to detect you if you get within 1400 meters. Keep tabs on your speed, too. All energy to engines will not trigger detection, but afterburners will. Also consider using the ECM device (ALT-X) if things look too tricky."

2929, "(fr)Heheheh. Guess I'm just starting to itch for a meal that's not reconstituted for a change."

2930, "(fr)Well, our next deal is going to be in Vasuda, so you might get your wish after all, Dave."

2931, "(fr)Mmmm. Desert clawbeetles roasted on the half-shell. Damnit, man- now you've got me hungry."

2932, "(fr)Uggghhh. I'll pass."

2933, "(fr)We're getting lunch in Vasuda- we decided that at the start of this run. I'm sure there's plenty of Terran food there. Or delicious protein pastes if you'd prefer, Dax."

2934, "(fr)Meeeeeh. Let's just finish this dropoff safely, aye?"

2935, "(fr)Aye."

2936, "(fr)Comms tap established on the freighter. Patching you in."

2937, "(fr)Got a tap on the freighter group. Let's see what they're chatting about..."

2938, "(fr)Wait- the Hammer's got a DESTROYER in this system? All the better for me to be moving on!"

2939, "(fr)Think about this for a moment, Yulia. If the GTA and the HoL are busy killing each other, consider the ...unique opportunities we may have."

2940, "(fr)You... have a point. I'll think about it, though no amount of payoff is worth getting nuked."

2941, "(fr)I understand your reservations- you're free to take whatever contracts you like, of course. I'll just keep you aware of your options. Fly safe. <connection to remote source terminated>"

2942, "(fr)Hey Dax. Did you ever hear back from your old pal, the ex-GTA guy?"

2943, "(fr)Who, Roland? Actually yeah, I got a message from him this morning. He's here in Antares, but he's really busy working a deal or something."

2944, "(fr)Damn shame. We really could've used another ship in our convoy. Did he say anything about what this 'deal' was?"

2945, "(fr)No, but he mentioned he was talking with some guy named Gavel."

2946, "(fr)Gavel., huh. Aaarg hang on. I need to reboot my comm system. Peice of shit. <connection to local source terminated>"

2947, "(fr)Alpha 1, do not re-establish a tap on those freighters. We did manage to get some information from them, and a second tap seriously risks exposure."

2948, "(fr)Communication tap established on the Vizier. Listening in as we speak..."

2949, "(fr)Voice recognition has determined that a source on the Vizier is presently in contact with Arris Gavel!"

2950, "(fr)You are to plant one of your Force CXI tracking devices on the Vizier. Be advised- planting the bug will completely break your cover, though the bug itself should be undetectable."

2951, "(fr)Your ECM system may cause enough distraction for you to escape safely. Either way, be prepared to depart once we're sure the bug works."

2952, "(fr)Alpha 1, you need to bug the Vizier soon! The gunship's subspace drive is almost charged!"

2953, "(fr)The Vizier has jumped out, and we are no closer to tracking down Gavel. Mission is aborted, return to base."

2954, "(fr)We have bug attachment.... And signals's good! Alpha 1, get out of there before you're discovered!"

2955, "(fr)***FORCE CXI LAUNCH SYSTEM ACTIVE***"

2956, "(fr)Good find. Yulia here can probably expect some extra 'random' customs scans in the future."

$b * $b Antares $b System
$b * $b 31/10/36

$b The $b Joint $b Service $b Drone $b Command $b Program

What you're about to hear is classified Level Upsilon. During the $r GTI $r Rebellion$| , it was revealed to top fleet officials that the branch's failed Joint Service Drone Command program did produce one successful technology. This technology would allow the remote control of manned fighters provided they were outfitted with the proper firmware upgrades. I don't know what $r GTI's ultimate goal with JSDC was, but one rumor is that it would allow them to continue operating fighters whose pilots had been wounded or killed in action. Another more sinister theory is that it would allow $r GTI to co-opt critical OpFor craft and use them to stage assassinations and false flag attacks, possibly against high ranking $b GTA officers, possibly against even $b PVI units if the technology could be adapted. Our operation focuses on this second theoretical purpose. 

Over the past several months, our efforts to bring $r Arris $r Gavel in for questioning have returned abysmal results. Therefore, we're going to turn $r Gavel against his employers. His old friends won't just disown him or refuse to shelter him. We want them hunting him. We intend to sully $r Gavel's name within smuggling groups and privateer circles so thoroughly he'll never be able to stick his head inside an inhabited star system again. At least, not without our protection."

2971, "(fr)$b New $b Technology: $b GTM-37 $b Ballista
 
We've received our first shipment of the $B new $B GTM $B Ballista$| . Improved fuzzy-logic and ambient-radiation cancelling algorithms allow the Ballista to reliably track targets out to 2.8 kilometers. Otherwise identical to the Phoenix V, the Ballista allows our units to engage targets before hostiles can bring their own missiles to bear. The new missile's passive target acquisition abilities also shorten the reaction time of enemy pilots, lessening their chances of successfully evading the Ballista."

2972, "(fr)A fourteen-ship convoy was reported leaving a rally point at the Juniper Mining Complex ten minutes ago. Our objective, $r Arris $r Gavel$| , has been hired to fly escort for these ships. We expect them to enter an asteroid field approximately 0.4 AU from $y Antares $y VII$| . They're trafficking goods that are heavily regulated under General Order 10: organic foodstuffs, Earth-produced pharma, smart manufacturing machines, and several other items put on the $b GTA's Restricted Trade list following the collapse of the Sol jump node. $b Alphas $b 1 and $b 2 will be deployed to the convoy transit site. The asteroid field should afford you some protection from the antiquated sensors of the convoy's freighters and escort Shrikes. $r Gavel and the gunship $r Vizier are already awaiting the convoy in the asteroid field."

2973, "(fr)Gavel's Fighter"

2974, "(fr)Vizier"

2975, "(fr)Smuggler Convoy"

2976, "(fr)Our operative has installed the proper firmware upgrades on $r Gavel's fighter. A transceiver hidden on the ventral hull will allow you to take control of his fighter from your Loki. $W Press $W 1 to run the hijack program on $r Gavel's ship. $W Press $W 2 to exit the program. You can toggle back and forth at will until the hijack is purged from RAM, which will take about five minutes after first executed. Make sure your Loki is a safe distance from the convoy while you're flying Gavel's fighter. $W Press $W 4 to completely terminate the program early. "

2977, "(fr)While in control of $r Gavel's fighter, you should have full access to flight systems, weapons, and ETS. Destroy as much cargo as possible while in control of $r Gavel's fighter. He flies a heavily uparmored Mustang Alpha, but don't let its durability lull you into a false sense of security. Also, be advised that the convoy's $B two $B sensor $B masks will interfere with the control signal, most likely in the form of video feed distortion. Destroy the convoy's screening equipment if it becomes a big problem, but $W prioritize $W cargo $W containers for destruction. The loss of the highly valuable and irreplaceable goods will irk $r Gavel's masters a lot more than the downing of a few freighters and Shrikes."

2978, "(fr)Convoy Sensor Screening"

2979, "(fr)After five minutes, or upon manual termination, control will return to $r Gavel permanently. The program will re-enable his jumpdrive and he will be permitted one jump before it flushes the navigation computer and cold starts the subspace drive. This will allow us a precious few minutes to talk with $r Gavel while he can't run away. We will track him after this first jump and you will follow. If he does not prove amenable to our proposition, disable his ship with your Disruptor guns and await a recovery transport. Be advised, if his ex-smuggler allies manage to follow him as well, you will be charged with defending the objective until he can be recovered."

2980, "(fr)It was imperative that $r Gavel be brought back alive for human intelligence purposes. He was one of our best shots at getting a handle on the $r Hammer $r of $r Light's collaborators in this system. Obviously, we asked too much of you."

2981, "(fr)Don't let the fact that Gavel's fighter is heavily up-armored lull you into a false sense of security. If you're taking damage from fighters, destroy them immediately. 

If protecting Gavel's fighter from attack, approach the task as you would defending a soft target. Missiles can't be shot down like bombs can, so destroy the launching craft as soon as possible. Mustang Betas can carry several salvos of Hornet missiles. 

If you were unable to compel Gavel to cooperate, his fighter will be sitting duck when the shooting starts again. The Vizier's dual-barreled railgun mount can destroy Gavel's fighter with as little as a single hit. Destroy it, or destroy the Vizier's weapon subsystems as soon as possible."

2982, "(fr)Your sluggishness failed this mission. Flight recorder analysis shows no system problems, and bioscan reveals you were not afflicted with any physical ailments at the time of launch. Your problems are obviously psychological, as in you must be stupid, and you are grounded until we find a cure for it."

2983, "(fr)Do not dwadle after taking off from the Intrepid. Jump to the asteroid field as soon as you can."

2984, "(fr)Your departure was unauthorized. You are stricken from the flight roster until further notice."

2985, "(fr)Do not jump out of the mission area until explicity authorized to. Look for a Return to Base directive in your mission directives list. You can also check mission goals to see if they have been failed or accomplished."

2986, "(fr)The objective was recovered and is already proving to be a boon for intelligence. The acquisition of $r Arris $r Gavel likely spells the beginning of the end for the smuggling rings in $y Antares$| . The information he brings to the table will help us launch a simultaneous assault on known hideouts and shipping routes that will cause their operations to unravel.

More importantly, he brings with him knowledge of the smugglers' complicity with the $r Hammer $r of $r Light's operations in this system. This should shed much needed light on the $r HoL's objectives and their means to achieve them."

2987, "(fr)You failed to frame $r Gavel for the destruction of the smuggling convoy's cargo. His reputation is not tarnished and he has no reason to seek refuge with us."

2988, "(fr)Total destruction of the convoy's cargo is unnecessary. Destroying a single escort fighter or cargo container will set Gavel's peers against him. However, wanton destruction of the convoy will intice him to proactively seek the GTA's protection, so the more damage you can do, the more cooperative he will be. 

Destroying the freighters themselves is inefficient and will cause the convoy to panic. Pushed enough, they will enter subspace and you risk failing the mission."

2989, "(fr)You self-compromised at a critical point in the mission, pilot. We understand the operational conditions were unusual, but the lapse in judgement you demonstrated out there is absurd."

2990, "(fr)Do not park your Loki closer than 2 km to the convoy whether you are in remote control mode or not. Do not fly Gavel's fighter over to either Loki, or lead hostile fighters to them. 

There is no range limit on the remote control function. "

2991, "(fr)MILINT is grateful for the intelligence you provided us through your cargo container scans. The presence of weapons, particularly Hornet missiles, in the convoy concerns us. It would appear the smugglers are not just trafficking in restricted consumer goods, but war material as well."

3084, "(fr)Arris Gavel, this is Major Predeha, GTD Intrepid. Our terms are simple. In exchange for your full cooperation and early retirement, you receive a full pardon for all crimes committed against the GTA."

3085, "(fr)In addition, the GTA will be obligated to provide you with a new identity and HVI status so long as you abide by our terms. It looks like your old friends will be here soon. Make a decision."

3086, "(fr)Damn, the smugglers are here too. Alpha 1, call for rearm if you need it. I think we're about to have more company."

3087, "(fr)Nah, I've done worse than back there. I'll take my chances. You two can go find another High Value Individual to puppeteer."

3088, "(fr)Didn't leave me much choice, did ya? You couldn't have just warped me out of there to your big, bad destroyer? Saved me a lot of face."

3089, "(fr)Three hours from now every system from here to Capella will have heard what you did back there. Three hours after that, there'll be a price on your head so big people will forget they can't go home."

3090, "(fr)Point taken. Fine, transmit the coordinates for the Intrepid. My employers are going to come looking for a refund any second."

3091, "(fr)Standby. Your nav systems and jump computer should finish rebooting in two minutes."

3092, "(fr)That's six hours I have to make a run for it and find a hidey-hole even you GTI bastards can't dig to. I bet six hours is a lot longer than I need for my jump drive to reactivate too. Let's get aquainted while we wait."

3093, "(fr)He wants to do this the hard way. Alpha lead, we've got two minutes before his nav computer has finished rebooting. Shoot to disable."

3094, "(fr)So the little rat does play with the big cats. "

3095, "(fr)Nooooo, it's not like that. These-"

3096, "(fr)Save it for the plasma, Gavel. You know what we do with snitches."

3097, "(fr)Alpha 1, we're outnumbered two to one. Use the platform for cover and protect the objective. Good luck, pilot."

3098, "(fr)Area secure. Diamond 1, what's your status?"

3099, "(fr)Figured you people would know better than I would at this point. Nav computer is reset and jump drive is charged. Are we going places?"

3100, "(fr)Affermative, transmitting coordinates for the Intrepid now. Alpha lead, we'll remain on station. Diamond 1, jump when ready."

3101, "(fr)Intrepid Control reports the objective in their Z.O.C. Your return to base is authorized. Command, out."

3102, "(fr)This is GTA Command. Diamond 1, what is your status?"

3103, "(fr)Acknowledged, we're transmitting the Intrepid's coordinates now. Jump when ready. Alpha 1, standby for further orders."

3107, "(fr)They've lost their fighter support. Use any remaining Ballistas on the Vizier's weapons subsystem! That should knock them out of the fight!"

3108, "(fr)Gederhall 4 here, we just lost our cargo to this maniac! What kind of sick joke is this!?"

3109, "(fr)WHERE THE HELL IS THE DAMN RESET SWITCH ON THIS THING?"

3110, "(fr)Their fighter screen's down. If we nuke their targeting array they won't have any business being here."

3111, "(fr)Alpha wing, we're deploying a support ship capable of recovering Gavel's fighter. ETA, two minutes. Don't let anything happen to that ship."

3112, "(fr)Alpha lead, I've got your wing. Let's hit those two M-Betas fast, because Gavel's a sitting duck and the Vizier's railgun will be popping shots at him soon."

3113, "(fr)We're going to lose Diamond 1 if the smugglers get any closer to him, Alpha leader!"

3114, "(fr)Recovery 1 reporting insertion successful. Setting course for primary objective."

3115, "(fr)Recovery 1 here, I'm taking fire! Alpha wing, requesting cover!"

3116, "(fr)We've lost Recovery 1. Recovery 2 will deploy once Alpha wing has resolved the situation."

3117, "(fr)Recovery 2 on station. Initiating docking maneuvers."

3118, "(fr)Recovery complete. Alpha wing, you're return to base is authorized. Command, out."

3119, "(fr)This thing's coming apart! Punching out-- <Transmission Terminated>"

3120, "(fr)This idiot just microwaved our cargo! Why isn't anyone doing something about him?!"

3121, "(fr)Gavel, you backstabbing bastard, we're going to pound you to assdust as soon as the Vizier gets back."

3122, "(fr)Alpha wing reporting deck cleared, no holding pattern scheduled. Breaking to mission coordinates."

3123, "(fr)The buildup started eight hours ago. Looks like it's our turn to stick it to Holly. I think all of Antares is going to be on fire soon."

3124, "(fr)Beta wing, Zeitgeist Zero One is reporting bogeys their sector. Standby for further orders."

3125, "(fr)Feels good to get out. My squadron, the 422nd Recon, was grounded not long after the Ant Eight action. Nice to know we're still considered useful for something."

3126, "(fr)Alpha wing, projected operations window is contracting. Set course for the designated coordinates and enter subspace immediately."

3127, "(fr)Alpha wing, SUTRAC reports the Vizier and her convoy have jumped to their first dropoff. Probability of successful interception is zero. Mission failed, return to base."

3128, "(fr)Confirmed attack on convoy Zeitgeist Zero One. Control reports multiple HoL bomber wings. Escort screen has taken casualties. Beta wing, your mission is go."

3129, "(fr)Intrepid to Diamond 1. Activate ILS and surrender flight control to autonav signals. You're queued for Pad Charlie-7. A security team will meet you at setdown. Present yourself UNARMED."

3130, "(fr)No, I thought I'd storm the Intrepid alone with my sidearm. Take over your ship single handedly, fly it around, blow stuff up I'm not supposed to. See how you like it?"

3131, "(fr)Patrols will be dispatched to disable your fighter in space. Support ships will dock and disable life support systems. You can be delivered unconscious for a full bioscan and cavity search."

3132, "(fr)Activating autopilot now. Pad C-7. Security team. Unarmed. Check."

3133, "(fr)Alpha 1, Zod cruiser at twelve low. Looks like it's one of the ones assigned to the PVD Frontier."

3134, "(fr)Primary objective failed. Alpha wing, external units will take over from here. We're pulling you out. Return to base."

3135, "(fr)PVC Medamud, wait two on transport. Caged recovery in progress. Admiral Po sends his apologies."

3136, "(fr)Zeitgeist to Control, we have multiple casualties on deck. Request priority CASEVAC to Intrepid."

3137, "(fr)Acknowledged, Zeitgeist, transport Omega 3 will evacuate."

3138, "(fr)If I find out that's you firing on me and not Gavel, you're gonna be a bunch of frozen gore chunks by the time I'm done."

3139, "(fr)GTF Loki identified! I'm opening fire, I mean my fighter is opening fire! Yeah! Good boy! "

3140, "(fr)Alpha leader, we need to keep our direct role in this phase of the operation as baseline as possible. Do not recommend engaging convoy directly."

3141, "(fr)You're bringing your Loki too close to the convoy, pilot. Even their old sensors won't have a hard time picking us up at that range."

3142, "(fr)Recommend you back off and come about. The transceivers for the hijack program will operate beyond that range. No reason to spook them with the Loki."

3143, "(fr)Why does it keep doing that!? Do you hate cargo containers? Did they drop you on your head when you were manufactured? Why why WHY WHY WHY?"

3144, "(fr)It's really hard to rewire control systems when this THING IS SHAKING AND TURNING AND BURNING, PEOPLE."

3145, "(fr)I'M SORRY! DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME IN THE NEXT LIFE!"

3146, "(fr)Presence of Hornet missiles in convoy inventory noted. Remain vigilant for any other smuggled weapons."

3147, "(fr)Alpha wing, you've been compromised! Evade and return to base immediately!"

3148, "(fr)This nutcase is RAMPAGING! I already have a preexisting anxiety condition! Somebody help!"

3149, "(fr)We're losing more ships to this madness. If they don't get us some backup, I'm bailing. No fee is worth this crap."

$b Ozymandias

Intel extracted from smuggling elements has revealed $r Ozymandias' obsession with Destroyer tech and that he may be in possession of some. Intent has shifted from destruction of the $r Cardinal to its capture.

The $r Cardinal must be lured into a battlefield, a time and place of our choosing. An anticipated and ambitious $r HoL raid on $y Antares' secondary tier facilities gives us this opportunity. 

$b Khonsu $b II is at the $g Angel $g Refuge $g Station over $y Antares $y VI$| , a haphazard collection of cargo containers repurposed for long-term habitation. He is on a goodwill tour, and his status, combined with the vulnerability of the outpost, make it a likely target. Camps like $g Angel were never intended to become permanent homes, but the post-War strife has made relocation difficult. The $quotebox people$quote have become an uncomfortable fact of life in $y Antares$| . Overcrowding and overtaxed life support systems make conditions inside miserable enough without warheads punching through from outside, but these camps have normally been low on the $b GTA's defense prioritization roster."

3185, "(fr)$b New $b Technology: $b GTM-15 $b Siren

The first production run of the $B GTM $B Siren has been delivered. Tested and manufactured here in Antares, we have been authorized to use our limited inventory for the upcoming operation.

The Siren offers modest gains over the Interceptor's target acquisition and homing abilities. Similar to its predecesor, simultaneous double-taps with the Siren can translate into instant PVF Seth kills if you're lucky.

Provided we can step up production and keep the facilities in $y Antares secure, we hope the Siren will become a terminal bane to every $r Hammer $r of $r Light pilot out there."

3186, "(fr)$g Angel $g Outpost isn't much to look at. The central feature is a new TC-TRI class container, designated $g Angel $g 1$| , to which most of the refugees in the surrounding cargo crates have been moved to. Defense of $g Angel $g 1 is your primary objective. We don't have the transports available for a full scale evacuation yet, but combat engineers from the 604th are on station to bolster Angel's protection. Ensign Navarre from 391st's $b Epsilon $b wing is already there. Every wing leader is being distributed $W Command $W Points to allocate towards their zone's defenses."

We expect the initial offensive to assemble and attack along these vectors, but be alert for changes in the enemy's approach. Setting up a forward deployment can reduce the number of hostiles you face at the container depot. You can achieve this by ordering a wing to guard the $W AE-1 and$slashor $W AE-2 $W Defense waymarkers. Also consider dropping a Defense Node at  one or both of these sites, but only if you have the command points to spare. Fortifying $g Angel $g 1 should take priority."

If $r Ozymandias decides to intervene personally with the $r Cardinal$| , we will respond with the $g Frontier and the $g Intrepid$| . The combined firepower of our taskforce will be enough to annihilate the $r Cardinal before the destroyer can finish cycling the jump engines. We hope to take the warship intact, but if $r Ozymandias refuses, we have every intention on demolishing his ship on the spot. Simulations indicate we can accomplish that in less than ninety seconds with the firepower at our disposal."

3197, "(fr)Frontier"

3198, "(fr)$B{ Sentry Gun (2  Pt.) $} - Standard Avenger armed GTSG Cerebus. A good choice for close in defense of objectives. In clusters of five or more they can be lethal to fighters, but susceptible to return fire from bombers. Not advisable to use these as a first line of defense.

$B{ Armor Plate (2 Pts.) $} - Repurposed cargo platforms cannibalized from nearby installations. The 604th has welded additional armor to them so they can withstand multiple Barracuda hits. Invaluable for protecting soft targets and even useful as stationary tactical shields at forward positions. They will absorb Hornet missiles so you don't have to. Put at least $W 50 $W meters between the panels and anything you want to protect to negate spall damage from bombs and missiles.

$B{ GTJ Nemesis Jamming Array (8 Pts.) $} - Field-kit modification of the Pharos nav buoy. Prevents hostiles within range of the jammer from achieving secondary weapons lock. The Vasudans have not developed a countermeasure to them yet. Unarmored, they should not be left in the open. Be aware that CEU has reported glitches in the Nemesis' targeting matrix that temporarily affect friendly units as well.

$B{ Defense Node (10 Pts.) $} - SG mounting six launchers equipped with the MX-27 (range 0.95km, 14 sec. lock time). Unsupported, they are vulnerable to fighter attack or capital ship weapons. But when positioned correctly they can provide a lethal distraction to errant fighters and bombers. They are slightly better armored than an Elysium transport."

$b Khonsu $b II survived the assault and is also en route to $g Antares $g Station to inspect the captured destroyer. Your outstanding defense of $g Angel $g Outpost and $b Khonsu $b II's publicity efforts have highlighted the plight of refugees across $y Antares$| . Collectively, this has forced $b GTA $b Command to reconsider its approach to the refugee influx. Efforts are now underway to expedite their transfer to safer systems such as $y Beta $y Aquilae and $y Aldeberan$| ."

3204, "(fr)$g Angel $g 1 was lost and with it over eight hundred souls, among them $b Khonsu $b II$| . Strategically, the outpost may have offered little to us. But I suspect the effect this defeat will have on morale, not to mention $W Terran-Vasudan relations, will reverberate for months to come.

Some officers in what's left of our fleet consider the military value of such outposts less than zero. I'd like to think we aren't that cold, not on this ship."

3205, "(fr)Don't leave the outpost without an active defense. Either deploy a dense SG field, a defense node, or assign a wing of fighters to its protection. Some combination of the above is recommended.

At the same time, blunting the enemy attack before it gets within bomb range of Angel 1 is important. Stationing a defense node, supported by fighters, near an egress point can reduce the numbers you face at Angel 1 itself.

Armor plates placed directly next to Angel 1 can provide an extra margin of error. SGs also make decent point defense weapons for shooting down bombs that do make it through.

Finally, remember to give enemy fighters special consideration. Their missiles cannot be shot down, and Angel 1 is not particularly sturdy to begin with. Either shoot the fighters down before they can be a problem, deploy armor around the cargo container, or jam the secondary weapons of the attackers."

3206, "(fr)You were not authorized to leave the engagement zone. You abandoned over eight hundred people to the $r Hammer $r of $r Light's dismal version of mercy."

3207, "(fr)Once the Intrepid and Frontier jump in, you may leave the mission area."

3208, "(fr)The transfer of Upsilon wing was not planned nor desired. Deploying them to your area undermined our defense of Rimcee Station and cost us over one thousand tons in lost supplies. Unfortunately, our losses at $g Angel $g Outpost necessitated it. You would do well to review your command decisions during the course of this mission."

3209, "(fr)Sekhmet bombers and Seth heavy assault fighters are probably the two biggest fighter killers during the Thanut offensive. Show them no mercy and use your new GTM Siren missiles liberally.

If you station fighters at one of the forward positions near the egress points, backing them up with a defense node or a half dozen SGs can increase their survival rate."

3210, "(fr)Your on board computer credits you with a TC-TRI cargo container kill. Review of your flight recorder confirms that, intentional or not, you dealt the most damage to $g Angel $g 1$| . You are stricken from the flight roster pending a review of your actions in this mission."

Sadly, the $g Intrepid was unable to rescue the crew before the $r HoL forces self-destructed the station. The explosion and preceding battle left the Intrepid crippled.

The $g PVD $g Frontier has been redesignated the $r HLD $r Frontier and is now bombarding $g Antares $g Station with torpedos while a fleet of cruisers is whittling down the $r HLD $r Cardinal's escort. The area has already been cleared of civilian traffic. Local security, however, is active.

$r Ozymandias and his command crew are being held on the station itself while the rest of his crew are locked aboard the $r Cardinal$| .

3456, "(fr)You did everything you could. Despite our best efforts, the $r Hammer $r of $r Light simply bested us. $r Ozymandias out-thought and out-planned our every move. In our naivety, we handed over the $g PVD $g Frontier and doubled $r Ozymandias' fighting force. All the while he sat in our custody with a half-cocked zod grin.

The $b Admiral wants his head, but this defeat has made the political atmosphere much more complicated. $b GTA $b Command has called a session with $b Admiral $b Po$| . We aren't sure what they have in mind, but since we can't seem to gain any significant ground, we suspect there is little faith left in our operations.

3602, "(fr)This goes all the way back to the Vega Engagement. Right after the Eisenhower went down, 4th Fleet bombed 
dirtside Vasudan targets on Vega III. One of the follow-up teams found an artifact uncovered by a blast 
crater. It wasn't until the Great War that GTI realized they'd picked up something from the Ancients."

3603, "(fr)It turns out it was a ship, codename OPHOSIS. GTI couldn't get it running until 2335, when they slapped a 
Shivan power supply inside. It was then that they learned OPHOSIS was equipped with an advanced subspace warning 
system. More capable than anything Terrans or Vasudans have developed yet. "

3604, "(fr)OPHOSIS was highly sensitive to subspace disturbances. It could detect eddys and currents in subspace our 
best science cruisers can't. A sort of Shivan early warning system. OPHOSIS being in Terran hands was a 
political timebomb, so Command kept the project under wraps for the whole war."

3605, "(fr)Then how did Ozymandias learn about it?"

3606, "(fr)Ozymandias was THERE, on Vega III, during the bombing. Crashed during the battle. It's in one of his 
screeds. He goes on about how we're a bunch of thieves and tomb raiders. He neglects to mention OPHOSIS 
specifically, but details from his account check out with classified GTI reports. He's probably been obsessed 
with this thing ever since."

3607, "(fr)Do we know why Ozymandias wants it?"

3608, "(fr)Maybe to deny it to you? Along with the Altair records, research from OPHOSIS helped the Bastion's 
squadrons get the Lucifer, and spawned the whole SUTRAC branch. Whatever we learn from OPHOSIS could 
theoretically help us against the Shivans, if they came back. It could provide a tactical advantage to whoever 
posesses it. Your guess is as good as mine, Alpha 1."

3609, "(fr)The Gavel Debrief strongly suggests  Ozymandias is already in posesssion of this OPHOSIS. Why is he still in Antares?"

3610, "(fr)After the Fall of Vasuda Prime, Command intensified research efforts on OPHOSIS. Antares was already 
behind the Lucifer's vanguard at that point - GTI decided to move OPHOSIS and associated research materials to 
this system. Have you heard of the Masada Redoubt, Alpha 1?"

3611, "(fr)I know it was some sort of contingency plan concocted by Sol. Last bastions for a Terran resistance should Earth fall."

3612, "(fr)You sound like a salesman for the military-industrial complex. But you're correct. One of those bastions 
was positioned in the Iraklion Corridor, the zero-G Langrangian point between Antares and her secondary. 
Plotting subspace jumps in and out of the Corridor has always been problematic."

3613, "(fr)Command began fortifying the Corridor, and the Masada Redoubt there was expecting OPHOSIS. Seven days 
before Loss of Contact, GTI tried moving OPHOSIS directly from Vega to Antares through the unstable node, but 
the Shivans intercepted the convoy. OPHOSIS was presumed destroyed. After Arris Gavel and his compatriots 
raided Gulnara Research, we started to wonder if OPHOSIS wasn't lost during the war after all."

3614, "(fr)Someone, I'm still not sure who, called in strikes on Gavel and the cargo container they took from 
Gulnara Research. Our pilots who returned asserted high probability kill on the container, but the casualty 
rate incurred in the pursuit discouraged a more in-depth probe. There was always doubt that OPHOSIS was gone 
for good. The Gavel Debrief just inflamed our concerns."

3615, "(fr)Is it possible Ozymandias didn't get what he wanted from Gavel after all?"

3616, "(fr)It's possible, but Gavel said the HoL held up their end of the deal after the exchange in Alpha Centauri. 
Right now, we think Ozymandias doesn't know how to use OPHOSIS and is looking to shortcut his own research 
efforts."

3617, "(fr)The OPHOSIS files mention something called AHEMAIT. We think this was the Vasudan element of the OPHOSIS 
research, which was extremely limited for political reasons. If AHEMAIT survived the same Shivan attack that 
should have claimed OPHOSIS, it may have reached Masada Station."

3618, "(fr)More importantly, Gulnara's debriefing of Khonsu II suggests Ozymandias knows this as well. Ozymandias 
was probably made aware of AHEMAIT through the HoL's spies. We believe this motivated his kidnapping of Khonsu II."

3619, "(fr)So his capture of Khonsu wasn't just to flip the Frontier?"

3620, "(fr)No, Khonsu said Ozymandias inquired about AHEMAIT by name. It's from Khonsu that we know Ozymandias is 
aware of Masada, but not its location. Khonsu said Ozymandias let us rescue him purely to discredit the GTA 
and empower the Antares Federation. Ozymandias is banking on the AF running interference for him while he 
finishes his search for Masada."

3621, "(fr)But the Frontier is important to his plans. He only has the same rumors about Masada to go on that you 
did, but he's heard the redoubt is heavily defended. Ozymandias was always going to bring in a second 
destroyer to hit Masada, but your deployment to Antares forced him to move his timetable up. The Intrepid's 
presence means he can't scour the system for Masada or invest in a long-term siege. He knows he has to move on 
Masada as soon as he finds it, or risk losing Masada and AHEMAIT to you."

3622, "(fr)How long until he finds the Masada Redoubt?"

3623, "(fr)Gulnara is going to cave to his demands for acccess to our databases. Masada Station isn't officially 
listed, but in the intelligence world, what's not said can be just as important as what is said. By cross 
referencing survey data, war records, and historical archives, it's only a matter of time."

3624, "(fr)I'm transmitting GTI's old routes into the Iraklion Corridor now, along with Sol's plans for Masada 
Redoubt. Alpha 1, I'm sure I don't have to point out this may be exactly what Ozymandias was hoping for. By 
releasing Khonsu, Ozy had to know we'd discern his goals sooner or later. Ozy could be waiting for you to lead 
him right through Masada's gates."

3625, "(fr)Understood, Greenbark. But like you said, it's only a matter of time before he finds Masada anyway. We need to get to it first."

3626, "(fr)In that case, I hope you beat Ozy to the punch, Alpha 1. Stay safe."

3627, "(fr)Likewise, Greenbark. Alpha 1, out."

3628, "(fr)Astrogation is showing a viable jump window into the Iraklion Corridor for the next fifteen minutes. Alpha 3, report back to the Intrepid. Captain Cernu's taskforce will be following us in."

3629, "(fr)Yes, Madam. Departing now."

3630, "(fr)Designated coordinates locked in. Pilots, engage subspace drives."

3631, "(fr)Zero movement out to five kilometers. Picking up several faint power signatures in the vicinity. TLW is buzzing with a low threat level. Background radiation is causing interference."

3632, "(fr)Alpha 1, be advised, active Cereberus sentry guns detected. Coordinates forwarded."

3633, "(fr)Confirmed. Picking up zero comm activity."

3634, "(fr)This place would have been garrisoned with GTI personnel. The rebellion might be over, but that doesn't mean everyone is on the same page. Keep those shields at full. We'll fire, but only if fired on first."

3635, "(fr)Pilots, begin approach for Masada Control. Some of these ships might have pingback functions left on. Scan any intact networks you come across, if you get the chance."

3636, "(fr)Colonel Nkrumah, is that you?"

3637, "(fr)Masada Station? We are receiving. This is Commander Rai, commanding officer GTD Intrepid."

3638, "(fr)Forgive me, Commander. Terrans can sound alike over a translator."

3639, "(fr)Forgiven, Masada. We were expecting to meet a Terran contingent."

3640, "(fr)Most of your kind wiped themselves out here long ago. As far as I can tell, I am the lone survivor in this decaying outpost. Your people referred to me as Ahemait."

3641, "(fr)Ahemait, we're the first wave of a Terran relief force headed into the Iraklion. Your government will be pleased to know you've survived this long. We'll get you out of there as soon as our friends are here."

3642, "(fr)Thank you, Commander. I have had no company but my thoughts during my sentence here."

3643, "(fr)Ahemait, we have reason to believe you're a priority target for the Hammer of Light insurgents. You and your work here could be invaluable to their war effort if either were to fall into their hands."

3644, "(fr)I understand. Some of the last information we received from the outside said you were victorious in saving your homeworld, partly thanks to our efforts on the Ancient ship."

3645, "(fr)Affermative, Ahemait. Unfortunately, we think the HoL is in possession of that Ancient ship now. Their commander, Ozymandias, has been ruthless in tracking you down."

3646, "(fr)Ozymandias. Last I heard, he was a fast rising star among the fanatics. No doubt he expects acquiring me or this base to consolidate his power base."

3647, "(fr)We have no intention of letting him get that far. OPHOSIS might be lost to us, but only because it's going down with Ozymandias."

3648, "(fr)Ozymandias only wants what we learned about OPHOSIS. What drove everyone here to violence so long ago."

3649, "(fr)Your research was responsible for all this? The abandoned stations? The burnt out fighters?"

3650, "(fr)In a way. Your GTI could not agree on what to do with our discovery, so they fought over it. Our discovery has its genesis in the work you Terrans did on OPHOSIS, before it was lost."

3651, "(fr)It was an automated scout craft, capable of anticipating Shivan incursions and reporting back to its masters. The Ancients gifted the ship with stealth and self-preservation systems the research team was never able to completely reverse engineer. The result was OPHOSIS."

3652, "(fr)At the twilight of their race, we think the Ancients were given unprecendented insight into the timing of Shivan attacks. Our research implies the Ancients used their own captured Shivan technology when building OPHOSIS."

3653, "(fr)Are we saying that OPHOSIS can see into the future?"

3654, "(fr)OPHOSIS was capable of multi-dimensional subspace analytics and pattern recognition that enabled it to predict an impending Shivan attack. Not just in a tactical sense, but on a system sweeping, Great War invasion scale."

3655, "(fr)We were able to dissect the Ancients' technology and recover their method for anticipating Shivan subspace activity. The model we adapted fits the known dates of Shivan attacks, including Ross 128, and the Ancients' before that."

3656, "(fr)What kind of effect would that knowledge have on our populations, Commander? Knowing when the Shivans will return, perhaps to finish what they started? Who's to say we will be as successful against them in the future?"

3657, "(fr)Ozymandias would be in a position of unassailable power among Vasudans if he could prove the date of armageddon. He would be at the head of a spiritual coup. And I suspect the implications for your species would not be much brighter if this information were made public."

3658, "(fr)Were your findings ever reported to anyone on the outside?"

3659, "(fr)A lone flight left the outpost not long after our discovery. Where it went and who it talked to, I do not know. When it returned a few days later, the fighting here started."

3660, "(fr)Colonel Nkmurah was the last person here to successfully escape the Corridor. He said he would bring help. That was three-hundred and forty-three days ago."

3661, "(fr)Three or four others escaped the violence before that, when they could, including one of my colleagues. He was to report our findings to a trusted ambassador in the Royal Court."

3662, "(fr)Khonsu II? "

3663, "(fr)Yes. How does the ambassador fare?"

3664, "(fr)He lives, barely. He was rescued from the HoL about thirty-six hours ago."

3665, "(fr)If my colleague was successful, Khonsu would have known we had a theory, a method, for dating the next Shivan attack. Khonsu would not know the specifics."

3666, "(fr)Then you have an actual date? When is the next invasion supposed to occur?"

3667, "(fr)Jump signatures detected! Three Terran fighter wings, plus three transports."

3668, "(fr)Omega 1 to Alpha wing, transit successful, all craft accounted for. What's your status?"

3669, "(fr)Primary objective accomplished, Omega 1. Your mission is go."

3670, "(fr)Acknowledged, Alpha 1. Be advised, weather report shows your currrent jump window is closing. Next window expected in five hours."

3671, "(fr)Copy that. Epsilon will detach from your group and escort my wing back to the Intrepid. Pilot, get us moving to that node, full burners."

3672, "(fr)Ahemait, my people are moving in to pick you up. We will be back with more help as soon as we can."

3673, "(fr)I can wait a little longer. In the long story of our cosmic struggle, a few more minutes won't make a difference."

3674, "(fr)Hopefully we can minimize damage to infrastructure. This place would make for prime defensive real estate, if we can hold it."

3675, "(fr)What do you pilots make of those six platforms ringed around the Control center at about a five kilometer radius?"

3676, "(fr)Judging by their positions, they might be part of a defense perimeter. Hard to say without a scan. Permission to break off and investigate, sir?"

3677, "(fr)Negative, pilot. Stay on course for Masada Control. We'll leave those auxiliary stations to Cernu's team."

Indeed, after the HoL's Thanut offensive last week,
 the GTA began to decamp here and at other civilian
 outposts throughout the system. "

3778, "(fr)GNN Broadcast

Now our so-called $quoteprotectors$quote are back
 to protect the extraction of Antares industry. The 
dock workers have refused the GTA entry to the 
station, and are denying them access to machinery 
and equipment vital to reconstruction efforts. "

3779, "(fr)GNN Broadcast

The shift manager is claiming his ships are unarmed 
and will provide active but nonviolent resistance to 
the GTA's intrusion. More updates as this situation 
develops."

3780, "(fr)Draw first blood and we'll draw the last. We've got friends on the way."

3781, "(fr)You have no idea what you're putting in motion here, Alpha wing."

3782, "(fr)You're reckoning is- <Transmission Terminated>"

3783, "(fr)Phi 2 executing defense program. GTA fighters have fired on me!"

3784, "(fr)Kocol, dammit, I'm not dying over this! Alpha, cease fire!"

3785, "(fr)Help- <Transmission Terminated>"

3786, "(fr)GNN, are you getting this? They're shooting at us!"

3787, "(fr)Oh God, they're going to do it, they're really going to do it."

3788, "(fr)I'm sor- <Transmission Terminated>"

3789, "(fr)Alpha leader, finish inventorying the cargo in the drop-off zone and transmit readout upon completion. Freighter wing Ancha will jump upon receipt. Command out."

3790, "(fr)Alpha wing, Omega, situation here. Civilians are rioting outside our dock. Our team is trying to extricate from the crowd now. Estimate plus two mics behind schedule."

3791, "(fr)This is Omega. We've intercepted time delay activation orders for all nearby sentry guns.  Online status in one minute."

3792, "(fr)No! Kocol! He's trying to force the issue! Alpha, we're transmitting override codes to you now. You'll have to scan the guns to establish a connection."

3793, "(fr)Cease fire! We need those guns intact! Admiral Po hasn't confirmed he's sending anybody to protect us after you're gone!"

3794, "(fr)Alpha, Alpha, Omega transport, priority update. Rioters have stormed Midwinter Control. Corporal Sadiq says they're bringing the sentry grid online."

3795, "(fr)GTA fighters, this is Chief Musari, Midwinter Operations. I'm transmitting override programs to you. Establish close range uplink by scanning each sentry."

3796, "(fr)The time delay safety runs out in less than a minute. I'm begging you, leave those guns intact. Admiral Po hasn't confirmed he's sending anyone to cover us after you're gone."

3797, "(fr)Same setup as the other TF Ion. Equipped with magnetic grapple, probably 200 meter range. Similar power requirements to the ML-16."

3798, "(fr)They didn't leave us any choice! It's not enough their Terran Command abandons us to the Zods, but now they raid our infrastructure too! Get out!"

3799, "(fr)GNN Broadcast

GTA fighters have just eliminated our remote video 
feed in contravention of the Warzone 
Correspondance Protections. We are rerouting to a 
lower quality feed from Midwinter Station."

3800, "(fr)GNN Broadcast



We, uh, seem to have attracted 
some unwanted 

attention. Go ahead, get us out of 
here...ah, GTA 
fighters have actually, yes, I do believe those 
were 

weapon discharges. In our 
direction. Yeah, 
that 

means JUMP."

3801, "(fr)Ancha reporting. Cargo objectives marked and confirmed. Initiating recovery."

3802, "(fr)Freighter wing Ancha aborting pickup. Recovery zone is too hot. We'll risk losing the cargo under fire."

3803, "(fr)We're downgrading Kocol's security clearance temporarily. You're safe as long as you're here, Alpha wing. Thank you."

3804, "(fr)Midwinter Ops to Alpha wing, we've reasserted control of external defenses. Thanks for sticking your neck out for us."

3805, "(fr)Midwinter to Alpha wing. You did what you could. I guess we'll have to make do with the rest."

3806, "(fr)Those guns were our last line of defense. You've killed us, Alpha."

3807, "(fr)Ancha wing reporting packages secured. Laying in outbound vector for the assembly area. Stand by jump drive. "

3808, "(fr)Hull failure imminent! We're losing helm control! Dravis, switch to backup-- <Transmission Terminated>"

3809, "(fr)Ancha 2, pull out! Ancha 2, do you copy?"

3810, "(fr)Command to Midwinter deployment, we're aborting this disaster. All units, return to base."

3811, "(fr)Alpha wing, knock those guns out before they shred our freighters. All targets are valid, weapons free, pilots."

3812, "(fr)Transport Omega reporting objective secured. Depressurization complete, clamps released. We're rolling out."

3813, "(fr)Good. Alpha wing, the situation over Gulnara is destabilizing. Convoy AB-120 is jumping to the node now. You are to join them as soon as Ancha has the cargo."

3814, "(fr)The wayward ones encroach everywhere. They have touched this place before. Soon they will again."

3815, "(fr)Ozymandias targets you because he trusts your kind can never believe as we do. Can you stop him, Terran?"

3816, "(fr)Was hoping you people would have this cleared up by now. Antares is screwed. Need to make my last pickup and run."

3817, "(fr)Hey, pilot, you mind busting this blockade wide open? I don't intend on being here when the Hammers get back to finish the job."

3818, "(fr)No service here either. It's like this all over the damn system. Things are getting worse."

3819, "(fr)You looking to add destruction of private property to the rapsheet too? Security has been ordered to shoot on sight. You'd best be moving."

3820, "(fr)Uh, Alpha wing, once those drones are repaired and retasked, we'll really need them to finish patching up."

3821, "(fr)Thanks for the assist, Alpha. We're beginning our final extraction mission now."

3822, "(fr)Alpha wing, the drones will bulldoze anything that gets in their way. But they seem to recognize stationary obstructions carrying the Midwinter IFF tag."

3823, "(fr)Alpha, freighters Ancha 1 and 2 have been deployed to your position for cargo retrieval. Do not let station personnel interfere with their mission."

3824, "(fr)Command, the dock workers have set the zero-G freight corridor to plus three G's. Our team is bypassing them on foot, but it's slowing us down. ETC, two minutes."

3825, "(fr)Command, we're clear for the manufacturing arm. Docking imminent."

3826, "(fr)Midwinter extraction teams, request update."

3827, "(fr)See anything you like, pilot? Go ahead, don't mind us, it's a help-yourself buffet. Bastard."

3828, "(fr)Watch the drones preprogrammed flight path. They won't stop for us, but if you can obstruct them with something they will stop for, we can get past them without destroying them."

3829, "(fr)Alpha wing, lock on to AB-120's transponders and initiate jump. "

3830, "(fr)Incoming fighters, this is Antares Federation space. You are surrounded and outgunned. "

3831, "(fr)Set throttle to zero, set shield and weapon recharge rates to zero, and expend your secondary reserves immediately or you will be destroyed."

3832, "(fr)GTA fighters! This is your final warning! Set throttle to zero, direct all energy to engines, and empty your  secondary magazines or get wiped."

3833, "(fr)Decoy Beacon! Evasive action!"

3834, "(fr)Bravo One to all fighters, destroy the GTA launch. Task Watchdogs to support, weapons free."

3835, "(fr)Smart move. This is Lieutenant Twomley, 101st Firesprites, Gulnara Defense Force. Stay where you are and follow our instructions to the letter."

3836, "(fr)Your comrades in the convoy escorts killed two of mine before we disabled them. Push me and I'll order your people scrubbed."

3837, "(fr)Antares is bleeding enough without the provisional government robbing us blind before they pull out. Your convoy is carrying supplies desperately needed for our own military and relief efforts."

3838, "(fr)Subspace activity at the jump node. Four contacts inbound, Hercules-class. "

3839, "(fr)This is Alpha wing of the 47th Cutthroats, GTD Intrepid, to incoming fighters, identify yourselves."

3840, "(fr)This is Lieutenant Suwon, 390th Dambusters. We are under orders to secure the Howell shipment for defense allocations in Beta Aquilae, under direct orders from the Advisory Council."

3841, "(fr)Negative, Lieutenant, the materials these ships are carrying belong to the Antares Federation. They are going nowhere but here."

3842, "(fr)My orders pertain only to the munitions, pilot. The rest of the convoy is none of our business, but Alhambra 1 and 2 are extracting with us, terminate."

3843, "(fr)It seems we've run out of time, Alpha wing.  If you're Po's people, you have authority here. The equipment I can take or leave, but I demand you order the food shipments and munitions back to Gulnara."

3844, "(fr)You have thirty seconds to comply. My government has authorized the use of deadly force."

3845, "(fr)Acknowledged, Alpha 1, we're turning back. Jump coordinates set at Gulnara Dock 1-4-5."

3846, "(fr)Order received and understood. Setting course for RNI Gulnara. Engaging subspace drive."

3847, "(fr)Alpha leader, we've got no connection unless jammers die or someone bugs out. Request leave to summon reinforcements. We need help, now."

3848, "(fr)Dambusters to Alpha wing. We're coming in full burn. I have SAPAD-1 on standby to clear those mines, hang in there."

3849, "(fr)My gratitude, Cutthroats. I'm sorry...next time we meet we'll probably be gunning for each other in earnest."

3850, "(fr)But if it means anything, your actions will help alliviate some of the suffering here, and maybe give us a chance at stability in our own name."

3851, "(fr)The Watchdogs have been safetied. You'll have to sweep the mines the old fashioned way. I'm transmitting their coordinates now. Good luck, pilots."

3852, "(fr)This is pointless, Alpha wing! You're throwing away your lives for nothing!"

3853, "(fr)What a waste. All wings, GTA fighters are valid targets. "

3854, "(fr)GTA fighters, this is Alpha wing of the 390th Dambusters. Stay alive, we're one minute out!"

3855, "(fr)Long range comms restored. Zero hostile movement on scope. Dambusters, can we get a line on that EOD for minesweep?"

3856, "(fr)Negative, pilot. My orders were to ensure Alhambra wing reached Yuma Station in Beta Aquilae. As your wing leader made that a non-issue, I don't think our participation is warranted any longer."

3857, "(fr)You worthless piece of shits. Dambusters, out."

3858, "(fr)Alpha wing, we're retasking fighters to your position. Friendly reversions in your area imminent. Stand by. "

3859, "(fr)Merde! They're killing everyone! Firesprites, fall out! Contingency paths! Move!"

3860, "(fr)Alpha wing, connection established and situation noted. All sapping teams are occupied. "

3861, "(fr)Check your sensors for intermittent signals from nearby Arothron beacons and destroy them. We will redirect fighter support to your O.Z. at the earliest opportunity. Command out."

3862, "(fr)I'm Lieutenant Suwon. We're with the 390th out of Yuma Station, Beta Aquilae. We're wave one of your relief."

3863, "(fr)We're Alpha wing, 47th Cutthroats, GTD Intrepid. Glad to see a friendly face out here. Request SITREP on your second wave."

3864, "(fr)I heard Po had sharp pilots, but now I believe it too. The locals outnumbered and outgunned you, even bugged your insertion point, but you blew 'em to hell anyway. "

3865, "(fr)My wing was patrolling the other side of the node when Yuma ordered us here to check on the convoy. Your scheduled relief was just being sortied when we jumped."

3866, "(fr)Alpha wing, contact reestablished. We're receiving your uplinks now. Analysis in progress. Standby."

3867, "(fr)Command to Alpha wing. The convoy escort is still down a wing. Remain on station until all relief has arrived."

3868, "(fr)You had me going, pilot. Thought you were going to fold to those yokels. If they had any clue how to run a system this populated or fight a war, maybe they'd still be alive. We did them a favor."

3869, "(fr)AB-120, resume course, flank speed. Dambusters, form up on Alhambra wing."

3870, "(fr)Alpha wing, we're getting under way again. Making best possible speed for our jump point."

3871, "(fr)We saw the broadcasts. You don't play well with other peoples' toys, so you're going to pony up and donate to the Antares Orphans Fund, starting with your convoy."

3872, "(fr)Glad you showed up, hero. Given your tactical prowess in gunning down unarmed museum pieces, we decided to use you against your own convoy. I want Alhambra and Hexamere wings, pilot. "

3873, "(fr)So the butcher of Midwinter is here to save the day. You can start by directing your convoy to come about and return to Gulnara. Consider it a donation to the Antares Orphans Fund."

3874, "(fr)In you, we see the same divisions we see in ourselves. Remember the days before the fall of homeworld. The agency that delivered death was as much the Destroyers' as it was our own."

3875, "(fr)But your imperium cannot be subverted by prophecy as ours can. That is what Ozymandias fears. That is why he focuses on your kind now, Terran."

3876, "(fr)Do you understand the wayward one's game yet, Terran? During the final battle, if humanity had been as divided as us, you would have the pain of sorrow, rather than the ache of uncertainty."

3877, "(fr)It was a Terran strike force that slew the Destroyer in her domain. Ozymandias views your sabotage of prophecy as heretical. He is determined to put nature back on course."

3878, "(fr)You'll go far with that kind of decision making, pilot. At the very least, you get to live for a couple more minutes. "

3879, "(fr)Have fun with the sentry guns and mines. After the mess you left at Midwinter Station, it's the least we can do."

3880, "(fr)Rest assured, next time me meet, things won't go as pleasantly. Firesprite One, out."

3881, "(fr)Good call, pilot. I wonder, do you have a heart after all? Or do you understand the universal language of violence when it's spoken to you, and not just the other way around?"

3882, "(fr)I'll leave the sentries and mines active out of respect to your victims. With the way you do things, I'm sure that's no big deal."

3883, "(fr)Pitiful recompense for the broken lives you left at Midwinter. But karma has her ways, and when she delivers, I don't expect you'll be long for this world."

3884, "(fr)Well done, hero. Maybe that makes up for things, but that's for the next life, not this one. There are people who demand an audience with the Butcher of Midwinter."

3885, "(fr)You should stick around. I've got some friends that you'll be dying to meet."

3886, "(fr)Hostile strike package inbound, modern craft. All convoy ships, maintain course and speed."

3887, "(fr)Terran fighters on scope, IFF codes rejected. Convoy ships, maintain formation."

3888, "(fr)Shit, beaucoup bandits, collision ranges! "

3889, "(fr)Command, we've been jumped! Hostiles at close range, heavy output!"

3890, "(fr)Don't reply. The convoy's almost there. We can take these idiots on their best day."

3891, "(fr)Vengeance leader to GTA convoy. Surrender the pilots responsible for leading the attack on Midwinter Station and you may proceed unharassed. You have ten seconds to comply."

3892, "(fr)Vengeance 1 to GTA escorts. The Antares Federation demands the surrender of the wing leader responsible for the attack at Midwinter Station. You have ten seconds to comply."

3893, "(fr)SAPAD 1 on station. Redirecting primary weapon power to remote suppression. We're jamming tracking systems on all Arothron mines out to five kilometers."

3894, "(fr)We've lost over half the convoy. Alpha 1, Kappa wing is taking over for you. We're pulling you out. RTB on the double."

3895, "(fr)Confirm connection with UXO! Spike spike spike!"

3896, "(fr)Fire in the hole! Multi-warhead launch, fuses lit! "

3897, "(fr)Mine detonation. Recording secondary munitions release."

3898, "(fr)Command, SAPAD 1 here. Field suppression rendered, all spikers cleared. We're returning to base. "

3899, "(fr)I miss the Shivans. There, I said it."

3900, "(fr)Big, faceless enemy with unlimited numbers and invincible ships. Yeah, I miss 'em too."

3901, "(fr)You have to admit, it was simpler back then. At least we were all on the same side."

3902, "(fr)Tell that to Holly. Actually, don't, I don't think we're getting replacement pilots for a while."

3903, "(fr)Speaking of which, Leaddie, you get the Newbie's Guide to the Intrepid yet?"

3904, "(fr)Not really, I just-"

3905, "(fr)It's easy. Horuses are Runners, Seths are Bulls, double tapping 'em with Sirens means instant painted skulls. Also, never, ever put a Zod at your six."

3906, "(fr)They're not all bad-"

3907, "(fr)I'm not done. There's a non-reg program in your DB, Turnpike-01. Sends encrypted spam packets over our wings' uplinks. You're going to want to run that if we see any Hammers."

3908, "(fr)Why?"

3909, "(fr)Ozymandias' favorite assassins are in play, the Pebekkamen. TacAn figured it out a few hours ago."

3910, "(fr)They scan our formations to see who's transmitting the most and assume they're the wing leader, barking orders."

3911, "(fr)Next thing you know, our wing lead's floating in a hundred different directions courtesy of Holly herself. You wanna get Alwyn killed, pilot?"

3912, "(fr)Negative. I hope this is just a stopgap solution."

3913, "(fr)Been paying attention? Stopgap is permanent these days."

3914, "(fr)Beta wing, GRIFFIN confirms Greenbark One is home. Your mission is go. Good hunting, pilots."

3915, "(fr)Cutthroats, stay alive out there. Good pilots are becoming an endangered species around here."

3916, "(fr)Same to you, Alwyn. Don't envy you if you're jumping to Gulnara."

3917, "(fr)One, MILINT know yet if we're facing an Arothron net too?"

3918, "(fr)Channel went dead ten minutes ago. Civvie networks are still up. They're mobilizing all over Gulnara, so maybe yes?"

3919, "(fr)What are we talking about, if yes?"

3920, "(fr)They'll use the Arothrons to position their sorties for raids and wave defense. Works well with their older tech."

3921, "(fr)The later models double as mines. You poke them and they literally burst with about three dozen seekers out for your blood."

3922, "(fr)But you can't just leave 'em in place. They'll keep using them to position their jumps."

3923, "(fr)The mines' stealth coatings make them hard to pick up on standard sensor suites. Eyeball one, put a good click between you and it, then blast it. Preferably after you call it out."

3924, "(fr)Don't the bomber squads have their own special pilots for this?"

3925, "(fr)Yeah, but Bomber Command has put the ones still alive up against Holly's caps. We're on our own for mine clears and sentry sweeps."

3926, "(fr)Control, refresh on Greenbark One. Beta wing requests status update."

3927, "(fr)Beta wing, wait one, situation is developing."

3928, "(fr)You a little jumpy, One?"

3929, "(fr)I downed, like, four go-pills this morning. I'm ready to rip the reactor out of the Cardinal with my bare hands."

3930, "(fr)Get back home safe, Alpha. We'd cry if we lost our KO fodder."

3931, "(fr)Funny, I seem to remember our squad topping the chart this week."

3932, "(fr)There's always next week. Unless there isn't!"

3933, "(fr)What a waste of fuel. We'll give 3C another minute to get their wires uncrossed, then we're doing Bull Run again."

3934, "(fr)Come onnnn. Can we at least do intercept drills this time? I'm defecting if I have to shoot anymore holographic Seths."

3935, "(fr)I'm sure Holly's thinking the same, whining about having to shoot down holographic asses like you. Maybe Defection Avenue is a two way street in Vasuda?"

3936, "(fr)If TacAn is right, we'll be stabbing each other over Gulnara soon enough. I'm good, I've got my rations packed and the natives even speak English."

3937, "(fr)I had a friend that got shot down over Deneb. They know he survived the crash because his was one of the hundreds of PLBs going off after action."

3938, "(fr)I always wonder if he understood there wasn't really anyone left to come get him. One month later, we're ex-Sol. Did they even have time to let his wife know? DID they know?"

3939, "(fr)Heh, my lady's in Beta Aquilae. I'm confident she'll be informed the moment the Zods paint my face on their hulls."

3940, "(fr)What about you, Leaddie? Any family close?"

3941, "(fr)Negative. Just parents on the other side of Sol node. Hope they're doing better than we are."

3942, "(fr)It would be hard not to do better than we are. But yeah, I'm sure they're fine. I'd sell you all to Ozy to be on the other side of that node right about now."

3943, "(fr)I'd sell you for one of the Cutthroats, or that other newb in the 38th. I'd sell you for a bomber pilot."

3944, "(fr)You can't see it over the vidfeed, but I'm crying, One. I'm crying."

3945, "(fr)Alpha wing, we're using Recovery 1 to pull Iota and Gamma from the field. Support ships are available."

3946, "(fr)Scratch one Arothron. Position and destruction logged."

3947, "(fr)The best part of this job is the pretty fireworks."

3948, "(fr)Where's the bloodthirsty one? You don't get off the hook that easy, kakhba. "

3949, "(fr)Oh look, our stolen cargo. And if it isn't the Cutthroat Psycho in person. You're going down a peg, asshole."

3950, "(fr)What do you know, we're just in time. To the GTA pilot from Midwinter, we regret to inform you your promising career has just been tragically cut short. "

3951, "(fr)Athena bombers are drawing firing solutions on the convoy. "

3952, "(fr)Command, Lambda team reports transfer complete. We're setting course for the Intrepid, out."

3953, "(fr)Convoy craft are secure and all mines cleared. Alpha wing, get out of there and return to base."

3954, "(fr)We're bugging out! Keep the peace, Cutthroats. Dambusters, out. "

3955, "(fr)Delta wing, 47th Cutthroats, GTD Intrepid, reporting as ordered. We're on your wing, Alpha 1."

3956, "(fr)You GTA thugs forgot to pay your carpetbagger tax. We're here to assess the penalty."

3969, "(fr)Po and the Intrepid are readying for the final battle, but need more time. Meanwhile, Ozymandias' ultimatum has been heard on all channels. Both the AF and the HoL are seeding the system with drones to find the Intrepid. One of the HoL's captured smuggling waystations is being used as a main staging area for one of these searches. The Cutthroats have been called on to destroy it to buy the Intrepid more time."

3970, "(fr)Alright, take your seats and listen up. With the $Y Antares $Y Federation taking hostile action, our position has been greatly weakened. We can't hunt down the $r Cardinal and the $r Frontier while still holding the 'Feds back. The $b Admiral is working something out to take the fight to $r Ozymandias himself. However, the Admiral has requested that we find a way to buy him some time for the upcoming operation."

3971, "(fr)The $g Intrepid is currently jumping from dead-zone to dead-zone in order to evade confrontation while repairs are made. It's not too hard to evade long range scopes and sensors and the Feds know it. Our scouts indicate that they are prepping Atlantis carriers to weed the Intrepid out. For those unaware, Atlantis carriers are used by $b Gulnara $b Research to launch probes into the furthest reachs of systems to map, chart, detect, and perform any number of scientific tests. Unfortunately, they are going to use the probes to pinpoint the locations of our fleet. If our ships are discovered, they will certainly make those positions known to the public, which in turn promises $r HoL attack or at least a $Y Federation raid. We cannot allow that to happen."

3972, "(fr)Dropship"

3973, "(fr)$b Gulnara $b Research has four of these carriers in system. We intercepted transmissions to Ikeya requesting several more, but our intelligence puts that delivery at several weeks out. If we can take these four carriers out of commission, that should give the $b Admiral all the time he needs. The carriers are currently under heavy guard while they are being loaded with the probes. Our information suggests that they will be ready with their operation in a matter of hours. The 309th will track the carriers from there. Once we know when and where these carriers are going to be deployed, we will send in the $b 47th to take them down."

3978, "(fr)This operation must be swift. The carriers will have light escort under the guise of a science op but once the 'Feds figure out that we're onto them, they will certainly raise the stakes. We'll control your nav computers from here and upload coordinates to each carrier as they become known. You'll need to jump in, destroy the carriers and move on. $B{ Do not waste time in dogfights or you may miss a carrier $} $B completely$| . They take less than five minutes to deploy their entire payload of probes.

Skids up at 0200, so set your loadouts and get going."

3979, "(fr)Good work, $b Alpha wing. By quickly destroying each dropship, you prevented the $Y Federation from detecting our fleet. They simply were unable to launch enough drones to effectively track or triangulate with any sort of reliability.

In doing so, you have bought us all the time we need to prepare our next few missions. The $b Admiral is proud to you have you on his side."

3980, "(fr)$b Alpha$| , you destroyed as many dropships as you could, given the circumstances. However, by not destroying each dropship, you allowed the $Y Federation to launch enough drones to detect some of our fleet. It will be difficult for our cruisers to evade every $Y Federation drone.

However, by rearranging our fleet positions, we should be able to minimize detection and in doing so, we will have plenty of time to prepare our next few missions."

3981, "(fr)Don't let Federation fighters draw you away from your primary objectives. Try using your wingmen to distract enemy pilots."

3982, "(fr)$b Alpha, you failed to destroy as many dropships as you could. By doing so, you allowed the Federation to launch enough drones to detect most of our fleet. Some of our fleet has already been detected and come under fire. It will be difficult for our cruisers to evade every $Y Federation drone.

4046, "(fr)With our previous missions a success, we are finally in a position to strike back at the $r Hammer $r of $r Light forces. The goal is to give the Intrepid a fighting chance against the $r Cardinal. To do this, we must lure away as many $r HoL forces as possible, including the $r Frontier. To do this, we will make use of the $y Iraklion $y Corridor's unique ability to limit subspace travel and communications. The $g Intrepid will enter the corridor using a route we are confident is under surveilance. After deploying additional fighter wings, the Intrepid will exit the corridor and run silent to $b Novograd$| . Once the Frontier has entered the corridor, the $b Admiral will do his best to taunt $r Ozymandias into a fight. The Frontier and its group must remain in the corridor until their drives recharge, so we must use that time to take them down."

4047, "(fr)We expect to face a numerically superior battlegroup, so we will be using our enemies' force concentration and ignorance of the battlefield against them."

4048, "(fr)Six of the $b Redoubt's artillery platforms have been crewed and loaded to bear. Construction was never finished on the six, and many of their subsystems were never installed. Because the platforms are essentially deaf and blind, $b Alpha $b 1 will be tasked with acquiring targets for fire support. This information will be sent to $b Masada $b Control, where it will be relayed simultaneously to all six platforms via an ECM-resistant optical signal. $b Lieutenant $b McGivers from the 422nd will set you up with several TC 2 practice targets to get you acquainted with the system."

4049, "(fr)We expect the forces pursuing the $f Intrepid to include modified Newet-class cruisers $h Apep and $h Duat$| . Intelligence leftover in $b Masada $b Redoubt suggests their weapons have been modified for higher output. However, they must go through a recharge cycle after long volleys. Use this to your advantage to whittle down the fleet while the cruisers maneuver for position of their next volley."

4056, "(fr)Once the $r Frontier's advance units have been stripped away, our forces will converge on the destroyer for the final attack. We must destroy the $r Frontier before she can open fire on $b Masada $b Control$| ."

4057, "(fr)Ammo types:

$W{ 430mm Fusion Mortar (30 Salvos Available): $} Standard armament. 1080 rounds stockpiled. At 6 per mortar platform per salvo and 6 platforms, we have enough for 30 salvos.

$W{ 430mm KE Impactor (90 Salvos Available): $} Scrap metal molecularly compressed into a mortar shell to have the same mass as a 430mm Fusion Mortar. These do minimal damage and will be used for simulation and training purposes only. They will be removed from your arsenal at the beginning of combat operations.

$W{ 430mm Suppression (5 Salvos Available): $} Cluster weapon. Each mortar carries three explosive submunitions. A full salvo will blanket an area approximately 1 km^3 large. The submunitions will only target hostile craft, however, calling a suppression strike danger close is considered a desperate measure. Good for softening up fighter wings.

$W{ Area Disruption (3 Salvos Available): $} Area effect EMP saturation. These can shut down targeting on even large capital ships for up to a minute. They have an area effect similar to the suppression warheads. Call these on top of yourself if you are surrounded, wait around the fire coordinates for the strike to land, then quickly reorient yourself and head for friendly units."

$B{ Battle of Iraklion Corridor +25 minutes $}

Welcome back. News of your victory preceded you. After escaping the Corridor, the $r Frontier did not rejoin $r Cardinal as expected. Recon tracked her as she ransacked an HoL supply depot before jumping to $y Antares $y VII$| . She appears to be lying low to make basic repairs. 

Our battle with the $r Cardinal was a draw at best. $r Ozymandias fielded a countermeasure to our torpedoes that left us with only blob and flak cannons. We're withdrawing to the Beta Aquilae jump node to buy us time to ready our own countermeasure. Moreover, Command has relented to provide reinforcements upon our arrival. 

The $r Frontier's survival is unfortunate, but not immediately worrying. $r Kuk's desertion of $r Ozymandias will never be forgiven. Plus, he's unlikely to risk his mauled ship when he can repair it and vie for the crown Ozymandias is about to lose. Never mistake ambition for initiative.  

Report to the briefing room. Your skills will be required if we're to check the $r Cardinal one final time."

4059, "(fr)Ordering all friendly units to disable the Frontier might have prevented her escape. But with the damage you inflicted, she won't be able to stop us before we decisively engage the Cardinal. "

$B{Battle of Iraklion Corridor +6 hours $}

We picked up another EP a couple hours ago. Nothing since. It's possible there's more survivors in hiding, waiting for a chance to bolt for the node, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

From what we've pieced together, the worst case scenario was realized. The $h Frontier rejoined the $h Cardinal and proceeded to reduce the $g Intrepid. $b Admiral $b Po rebuffed $r Ozymandias' demand for unconditional surrender. The log then records the admiral giving the order to abandon ship. Witnesses say Ozymandias deployed transports to embark on Intrepid. Seventy-nine seconds later, a cataclysmic explosion split the Intrepid in two. We believe she was scuttled to prevent capture. 

$r Ozymandias has wasted no time in laying claim to $y Antares and its resources. With the technology and following he has picked up during his campaign there, he is in a position of uncontested power. The $r Hammer $r of $r Light has the upper hand now, and not just here. Everywhere."

4061, "(fr)Losing Masada Control cost you the battle. If the station falls, the Frontier will be able to escape almost instantaneously. Ensure its security first, then worry about other objectives."

Welcome back. Our battle with the $r Cardinal was a draw at best. $r Ozymandias fielded a countermeasure to our torpedoes that left us with only blob and flak cannons. We've jumped further in system to buy us time to prepare our response. Command is sending help, but our plans won't hinge on their arrival. The $Y Antares $Y Federation has started blockading the Beta Aquilae jump node.

Our situation would feel a lot worse if it weren't for telemetry you brought back. The sight of the Frontier going up is the broken link in $r Ozymandias' chain the $b Admiral was hoping for. We just started broadcasting the video shipwide and on civilian band frequencies. The cheering on flight deck still hasn't stopped, and the $b PVN can rest easy knowing their comrades have been avenged. 

Report to the briefing room. Your skills will be required if we're to check the $r Cardinal one final time."

With the $r Frontier at large and still combat effective, we had no choice but to but to break off battle with the $h Cardinal. $r Ozymandias fielded a countermeasure to our torpedoes that left us with only blob and flak cannons. We would stand no chance against the combined firepower of the two Typhons again. The $g Intrepid has retired to $y Beta $y Aquilae$| , and $b Admiral $b Po is facing a court-martial for the loss of $y Antares$| .

$r Ozymandias has wasted no time in laying claim to the system and its resources. With the technology and following he's picked up during his campaign, he's in a position of uncontested power. The $r Hammer $r of $r Light has the upper hand now, and not just here. Everywhere."

4094, "(fr)If you'll look to the left side of your HUD, you'll notice the fire control overlay. I'd like to direct your attention to the upper left, sir."

4095, "(fr)That first line is your target range setting of 400 meters. Below that is the ammo type to be used in the current mortar strike. The third line displays how many salvos of that particular ammo type the platforms can fire."

4096, "(fr)Right below that is Estimated Time to Target Point. This is the average of the times it will take the mortars from each of the six platforms to arrive at your target coordinates. You'll have to remember the first mortars might arrive a few seconds before that figure, and the last batch a few seconds after that figure, depending on the extremity of the coordinates you send."

4097, "(fr)To the lower left you'll see the fire control status bar. It'll update you on if you've got a strike ready or how long until you can call in the next one."

4098, "(fr)Go ahead and cycle through the available ammo types. You're looking for the 430 mil KE Impactors."

4099, "(fr)Right, now the coordinates you call in are always along your forward vector at whatever the range setting is. For example, if you called right now your strike would be delivered 400 meters directly in front of you."

4100, "(fr)Lock up Container Group Super. There's a handy waymarker in the center of the boxes. Check your Escort List if you can't find it. Get to within about 400 meters of that waymarker, drop your crosshairs on it, then call in a strike."

4101, "(fr)All units, converge on the Frontier and destroy the warship. Alpha 1, pump every remaining salvo you've got into that fish."

4102, "(fr)Good effect on target, sir. Note the waymarker at your target coordinates. Whenever you call a strike, this waymarker will show where the ordnance is headed. You'll be flying all over the place when shit gets real, and this helps keep track of where the fire mission should land."

4103, "(fr)Keep calling the shots until this batch is erradicated. You'll note it gets harder as your target area decreases. Reposition as necessary, and try calling in coordinates around the containers rather than directly on top of them."

4104, "(fr)Right, those crates won't be menacing us any longer. But there's more where they came from. Container group Dynamic is up next, and defended by four Watchdog SGs. This is where distance comes in handy."

4105, "(fr)You can set your target coordinates as far as 5000 meters in front of you or right on your head at 0 meters. Cycle the range setting up or down to match the range of container group Dynamic, then start adding them to the debris field."

4106, "(fr)Looking good. You've graduated to the final round. There's a Chronos several clicks down range running a rookie level evasion program. That's your target. Go ahead and lock it in."

4107, "(fr)Don't expect Holly to sit obligingly still while we shell them to death. They're going to move, and they're probably going to be rushing us the whole way down the Corridor. Moving targets are going to require some sharp-eyed spotting and luck on your part."

4212, "(fr)Going Out With a Bang"

4213, "(fr)Our last engagement with the $h Cardinal was a tactical victory for $r Ozymandias$| . While our evacuation of $b Novograd $b Station was successful, we took heavy casualties and were forced to withdraw. Damage to astrogation subsystems has forced us to drop out of subspace. We're conducting repairs while we make for the $B{ Beta Aquilae jump node $} at best possible speed. SUTRAC reports the Cardinal has since departed the Novograd engagement site and is believed to be in pursuit. We expect contact within the next fifteen minutes."

4214, "(fr)Novograd"

4215, "(fr)Intervention"

4216, "(fr)$r Ozymandias beat us to a working torpedo decoy beacon by mere hours, and it cost us dearly at Novograd. Our $b Howell torpedoes were led off course by his fighters, while his $W Aratrums savaged our battlegroup. Engineering has signed off on the deployment of our own $W prototype $W decoy $W beacon$| , and you have been selected to take it into the next battle. A second prototype is being finished as we speak, and will be assigned to $g Epsilon $g 1$| ."

4217, "(fr)Decoy"

4218, "(fr)Like our own GTM Howell, the Vasudans' Aratrum sacrifices counter-countermeasure redundancy for manuverability and superior all-aspect tracking ability. That's what makes them faster than our bomber launched weapons. However, this also makes the Aratrums susceptible to decoys. Your beacon will mask your sensor signature with that of the $g Intrepid's$| . The beacon draws power from your weapon banks and $B{ requires at least a 10% energy $} reserve to remain active. When activated $B (press $B 1)$| , Aratrum torpedoes will track you as a target. Keep your shields up, and stay within 2 kilometers of the $g Intrepid or the decoy will lose its effectiveness."

4219, "(fr)$r Ozymandias' torpedoes won't be able to reach us, but ours will be equally ineffective as long as his decoys are in place. We're counting on you to help us maintain a fighting stalemate in the impending engagement. Ozymandias still has a meager reserve he can call on, and we expect him to throw them into battle against you. Until we can get $f Epsilon wing in the field, things are likely to be brutal. We'll do what we can to check Ozymandias' fighter corps by keeping his escort units and decoys busy with our own torpedoes."

4220, "(fr)Once $g Epsilon deploys with the second beacon, you'll be going on the offensive. Identify and destroy $r Ozymandias' decoy screen to let our own salvos through. SIGINT will be monitoring $r Cardinal's fighter bay traffic for any sign of a mass evacuation. $b Admiral $b Po has made special preparations in the event Ozymandias attempts to flee the Cardinal."

4221, "(fr)As the window between launch and subspace jumps could be as short as thirty seconds, we'll have to act fast if $r Ozymandias' flight is detected. We've earmarked $B{ eight Howell torpedoes with proximity fuses and special tracking instructions $} for this contingency. Your decoy beacon will switch to an $B{ alternate IFF mode that will allow our own torpedoes to home in on you. $} Use this to guide our torps around the bulk of the $h Cardinal so Ozymandias can't use its hull for cover. Once the torps have a clear run at the escaping transports, deactivate your beacon so the torpedoes will reacquire their original targets. Optimal coordinates for this maneuver will be uploaded to you in the event of this contingency $B (Press $B F12)$| ."

4222, "(fr)Evacuation Transports"

4223, "(fr)$r Ozymandias smells blood and thinks he's coming in to finish us off. We need to surprise him as rudely as he surprised us at Novograd. The genuine direness of our situation works in his favor as much as it does ours, because Ozymandias will be more likely to stick around to ensure a kill. Ozymandias' eagerness will be his undoing, if $b Admiral $b Po has planned this right."

4224, "(fr)The $g Intrepid went down with all hands. Our failure here, today, has come at a great cost. Command can no longer continue operations in $y Antares. All surviving $b GTA persons are to be transferred to $y Beta $y Aquilae and $y Antares will be surrendered to the $r Hammer $r of $r Light$| .

Pack it up, pilot. You ship out in one hour."

4225, "(fr)Make sure to prioritize using the decoy beacon over combatting hostile craft. Use the GTC Intervention as cover."

4226, "(fr)The $r Hammer $r of $r Light's command ship, the $r HLD $r Cardinal has been destroyed! The $r HoL will be hard pressed to continue operations in the $y Antares system from this point forward."

4227, "(fr)Additionally, $r Ozymandias and his officers were killed when you successfully pulled off a risky operation to intercept the $r HoL escape craft. You are to be commended, pilot. Ozymandias was clever and methodical but in the end, he was clearly a coward. His defeat will surely serve as a warning to any remaining $r Hammer $r of $r Light operatives in this system."

4228, "(fr)Unfortunately, $r Ozymandias and his officers were able to flee the engagement as you were unable to guide the torpedos into position. We are unsure of his future intentions but with the loss of his command ships, Ozymandias will need to flee $y Antares until he can regroup and rebuild his fleet."

4229, "(fr)When ordered, you must go to the staging waypoint. Pay attention to the Proximity alert sound after the torpedos have been fired. Disable your decoy system when the torpedos are nearby your ship to ensure they can make it around the Cardinal."

4230, "(fr)However, we paid a price for this victory. There is little left of our battlegroup and the local government is seeking sanctions against $b Admiral $b Po and the $b GTA. We have little choice but to leave the system in Federation control. The $Y Antares $Y Federation have agreed to sign a non-agression act with the GTA on the condition that $g GTD $g Intrepid is reassigned. GTA Comand has ordered our battle group to $y Delta $y Serpentis pending an investigation into the events that occured here in $y Antares. Leaving Antares in the hands of the Federation was a far greater option than surrendering the system to the Hammer of Light. This is a victory, pilot, however bittersweet."

4253, "(fr)The Amduat has been annihilated."

4254, "(fr)That was an Aratrum impact, pilots. Ozymandias is trying to overwhelm our defense through sheer number of projectiles."

4255, "(fr)Your campaign in Antares is over, Admiral. I can acknowledge this even if you are unwilling to."

4256, "(fr)Ozymandias is committing his reserves. Avoid engaging until they bring the fight to us. Keep our screen intact!"

4257, "(fr)This is Captain Siroco of the Antarian Ranger to Ozymandias. Our non-aggression pact with your forces has been declared void. Admiral Po, do you require assistance?"

4258, "(fr)Affirmative, Ranger. Pour everything you've got into the Cardinal. They aren't leaving this one."

4259, "(fr)Your flying debris field is contemptible, Terran. Once the Intrepid has been smashed, Gulnara and Thanut will burn for your treachery. "

4260, "(fr)Captain Siroco to all AF forces, we're going down. I am transferring the flag to Encarnacion. Good luck."

4261, "(fr)Captain Siroco to all AF forces, the Encarnacion has been destroyed and we are going down. I am transferring command to Admiral Po. Ozymandais will never forgive our reneging on the pact. Win this day. Ranger out."

4262, "(fr)Alpha 1, we can't sustain under this kind of bombardment. Divert those torpedoes and buy us a little more time."

4272, "(fr)Superstructure's giving in! All hands, abandon ship!"

4273, "(fr)Cardinal, this is the second and last time I make this offer: surrender or die."

4274, "(fr)Look around you, Admiral. You've been saved by a pitiful compilation of pre-War novelties, piloted by Terrans who despise your presence in this system."

4275, "(fr)This is what you have become. This is your new reality. And yet you hope to hold out against the Shivans like this?"

4276, "(fr)I have won, Admiral. No matter what you do today, nature will return our species to their destined places in history."

4277, "(fr)Dvorak to all units, commencing mortar run on Cardinal."

4278, "(fr)Dvorak to Spirit, break off and return to base. We'll need that hull at Gulnara."

4279, "(fr)Affermative, Dvorak. Outbound vector selected, fifteen seconds to jump."

4280, "(fr)This is Antarian Spirit. We've got runaway munition cook-offs in the primary hold. Suppression systems failing!"

4281, "(fr)Those were twelve of my most faithful pilots. I hope their sacrifice is appreciated by what's left of your defense screen."

4282, "(fr)Ozymandias has a skirmishing force closing in, twelve hostiles total. Pilots, prepare to engage."

4283, "(fr)Pilots, the HLC Tiye is raking our ventral side and we can't bring our torpedoes to bear. Alpha leader, task any available unit to destroy it."

4284, "(fr)Alpha 1, priority alert. SIGINT reports Cardinal is issuing evac orders on command and cargo decks. Position yourself for intercept."

4285, "(fr)All units, hostile transport launch detected. Two contacts, Isis-class. Stop them before they jump."

4286, "(fr)Reinforce those shields, Alpha 1. Don't expose one square meter of hull."

4287, "(fr)Try not to ride out those shockwaves, Alpha 1. Turn into the missiles until their fuses run out."

4288, "(fr)Don't fly directly into the shockwaves, pilot."

4289, "(fr)Those were twelve of my most faithful pilots. It appears your leadership has improved since our last encounter."

4290, "(fr)Can you feel those detonations inside your armored shell, Admiral? Your pilot would rather save his own skin than your doomed ship."

4291, "(fr)Your pilot is a coward, Admiral. The resolve of your best warriors is breaking."

4292, "(fr)Another direct hit on the Intrepid. How does it feel to be let down by your best pilots, Admiral?"

4293, "(fr)How many of those becaons do you have, Admiral? It can't be many. Would be tragic if you lost this one."

4294, "(fr)Yours is a valiant effort that shames the faithful, pilot. But your time here is running out."

4295, "(fr)Just a moment's inattention, pilot. That is the difference between survival and your blessed extermination."

4296, "(fr)Intervention, proceed to the Beta Aquilae node and rendezvous with the Minnow. Captain Mankowski, confirm!"

4297, "(fr)Sorry, Admiral, navigation and helm are shot to hell. We aren't going anywhere."

4298, "(fr)Epsilon wing on station. Decoy beacon online. We're good to go, Command."

4299, "(fr)Confirmed, Epsilon 1. Alpha 1, destroy Ozymandias' decoy fighters. Use any resources at your disposal."

4300, "(fr)I didn't give you enough credit, Admiral. Now, which will live longer? You, or your pilot?"

4301, "(fr)Very amusing. You have my rapt attention, pilot. Dispatch, terminate that fool."

4302, "(fr)Tracking zero duplicate sensor profiles. We have solid lock on the Cardinal."

4303, "(fr)Evacuation launches confirmed. Fishes one through eight in the water. Hot and tracking good, Alpha 1. Good luck."

4304, "(fr)All units, we're observing heavy activity on Cardinal's hangar control frequencies. We're prepping our last Howell salvo."

4305, "(fr)Cardinal's shedding velocity. This is the real deal. Alpha 1, get in position."

4306, "(fr)Ridiculous."

4307, "(fr)Cardinal's not out of the fight yet. Ozymandias has deployed a bomber wing against the Antares Federation."

4308, "(fr)Sensors confirm solid kills, six total. Well done, Alpha 1."

4309, "(fr)Enjoy this victory, Admiral Po. Our years in this galaxy are numbered. My part in decrementing that number is nearly complete."

4310, "(fr)It's over, Admiral. Your GTA will end like the texts of Alexandria. Your victories, your history, your people will all be ashes in due time."

4311, "(fr)And the pillar falls."

4312, "(fr)It seems Admiral Po's faith in his people was misplaced."

4313, "(fr)Fear not, pilot. The ten thousand people you failed will be joined by many others in due time."

4314, "(fr)This is Captain Wadde of the AFC Dvorak to GTD Intrepid. Our orders are to escort you and your ships to the Beta Aquilae node and see you safely out of the system. For an amicable solution to our crisis, we are standing down from battlestations."

4315, "(fr)We request you resume your original flight plan while you conduct repairs, Intrepid. We are bringing the situation in Antares under our control."

4316, "(fr)Our primary objectives have been met, Captain Wadde. I take it Gulnara has enough to chew on without dragging out this particular fight."

4317, "(fr)Yes, Admiral. Some of the more militant voices wanted me to seize your destroyer. But even if I wanted to, I don't think the odds line up quite right."

4318, "(fr)On that we can both agree, Captain. Your request does not conflict with my orders. We are resuming our course at best possible speed."
