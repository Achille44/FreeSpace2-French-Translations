MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "Lieutenant Ross. Cavill, wing leader. Callsign 'Ahab'. Welcome to the Artemis." 7130 "01a-16"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "Looking forward to showing our new Commonwealth visitor a thing or two about Federation service. 'Raptor' McKearney is another Commonwealth pilot here on exchange. You'll meet her later." 7131 "01a-17"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "Your file shows Erskine Orbital as your last post. Carrier postings are a different beast to station duty but you'll do fine. You'll have plenty of support while you're getting your bearings." 7132 "01a-18"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "Artemis is a cruiser-carrier hybrid. She doesn't have the air wing size or nuclear ordnance of the larger fleet carriers, but her heavy autocannons get the job done." 7133 "01a-19"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "She's got a reputation in Fifth Fleet as a brawler. She thrives in close quarters combat, wading into groups with fists flying." 7134 "01a-20"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "We're the only onboard squadron, a multirole combat unit flying Viper defenders and Hornet strikers. Depending on the sortie, we'll be performing either air superiority or anti-ship strike missions." 7135 "01a-21"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 7129 "Anyway, I'll keep this short as I expect you'll be wanting to settle in. I'll see you at 0800 hours tomorrow for your orientation." 7136 "01a-22"
