MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "Stuart. I don't know what state of mind you're at right now, but it was important that I sent this. Important to you, and to me." 6862 "10a-09"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "I want to apologise for not telling you about being in ANI. I understand if you're still angry. I would never have kept it from you if it wasn't necessary." 6863 "10a-10"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "You told me it's like you can't trust anything I say anymore, but I've never lied to you directly. Everything I've told you, where I'm from, my family back home, it's all real." 6864 "10a-11"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "ANI recruited me when I applied for the Federation exchange program. The whole time on Artemis I was an intelligence agent. Pace was my case officer." 6865 "10a-12"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "I had to keep it secret, Ross. I couldn't blow the operation. No one could know about it, not even friends like you. I hope you realise this, now that you've seen what's happening." 6866 "10a-13"

MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "I never meant to deceive or hurt you. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I hope this doesn't have to be the end." 6869 "10a-16"
MSGXSTR "McKearney" 3482 "Our duty to the Crown sometimes requires us to sacrifice our values for the sake of the country. I hope that we haven't had to sacrifice our friendship too." 6870 "10a-17"
