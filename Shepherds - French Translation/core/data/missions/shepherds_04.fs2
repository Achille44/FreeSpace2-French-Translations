-GVD Memphis, 11th Battlegroup
-July 17th, 2367$}

$b -Welcome

To the attention of all officers and crew of the $f GVD $f Memphis$| , this is Admiral Nekba speaking. I would like to first wish a warm welcome to all pilots and crewpersons displaced by the $h Shivan offensive$| . The $f Memphis is a proud ship whose crew have faithfully served both the Emperor and the Vasudan people with honour and distinction, and your presence here will not only strengthen our reputation within the Alliance, but will cement the $f 11th $f Battlegroup's standing as a premier GTVA frontline unit. 

From our battles with the rebellious $h Neo-Terran $h Front in $b Alpha $b Centauri$| , $b Sirius and $b Regulus$| , to our recent operations here in the $b nebula$| , our battlegroup has proven time and time again to be capable of tackling any challenge put before us. We now face our greatest challenge yet -- our very survival.

 XSTR("$b{-Allied Retreat$}

In the past twenty-four hours, we have gone from being on the cusp of securing this frontier of space to witnessing a full-scale rout of allied forces from the nebula. We have lost the $f GVD $f Psamtik$| , the $f GVD $f Amunet$| , the $f GTD $f Ionia$| , and numerous other vessels to this renewed $h Shivan onslaught. The death toll is estimated to be over fifty thousand, with thousands more missing-in-action. In addition to the discovery of a $h second $h Sathanas-class $h juggernaut$| , recent operations in the nebula have encountered at least six additional Shivan destroyers and dozens of previously-unreported corvette and cruiser-class warships. One of these destroyers, a $y Ravana$| -class destroyer designated the $h SD $h Andromalius$| , is a cause for growing concern, as it is directly responsible for the destruction of seven allied warships, including the $f Amunet and the $f Ionia$| .
 
With our beachhead at the node lost, all allied units remaining in the nebula are effectively trapped behind enemy lines. All attempts by the $f Memphis to contact Command have failed, suggesting that the Shivans have struck our communication relays in either $b Gamma $b Draconis or $b Capella$| , severing our link to the rest of the Alliance.

 XSTR("$b{-Plan of Action$}

Before we attempt to escape the nebula, there are still two objectives here that must be completed.

Our first objective is to render necessary repairs to the $f Memphis ahead of a push through to $b Gamma $b Draconis$| . Our recent offensive operation that bought time for the safe withdrawal of many allied assets came at the cost of our photon beam cannons, which were finally spent during our victorius but intense engagement with the $h SD $h Ashimmu$| . Although we are escorted by our comrades aboard the $f GVCv $f Maahes and the $f GVC $f Shu$| , who have served skillfully alongside the $f Memphis since the formation of our battlegroup, we will need the firepower of our main guns to ensure a safe retreat to $b Capella$| . Intelligence has pointed us to a number of cargo depots far behind the Shivan advance which may contain the parts necessary to bring our guns back online.

Secondly, we are aware that thousands of allied personnel remain stranded in the nebula outside of our small fleet. It is our obligation as officers of the $f GTVA to spare any available resources to find them -- to shepherd them back safely to allied space.

All squadron leaders are to report to quarterdeck, where I will brief you of your squadrons' orders. Sa Vasuda, and Sa Terra.", 5985)

The $g 36th have faithfully served the Vasudan people at our most desperate times$semicolon from the battlefields of $b Antares at the height of the $y 14 $y Year $y War$| , to the carnage that consumed our space during the $y Great $y War and along the $b Alpha $b Centauri$|-$b Sirius$|-$b Deneb line in the recent $r NTF conflict.

Allow me to express my condolences for the loss of your flagship. I had the privilage of serving aboard the $f Ionia as part of the Officer Exchange Program at the onset of the rebellion. Admiral Ranov was an officer who worked tirelessly to maintain the bond between our two species. They will be missed.", 5986)

Our engineers are already hard at work in getting our main beam cannons back online, and we can expect to have sufficient firepower to lead our forces back to allied lines. Unfortunately Sigma wing was unable to retrieve more supplies as heavy Shivan reinforcements swarmed into the area. Beta wing ensured that all cargo was destroyed before withdrawing back to the Memphis.

Shortly after arriving in your area of operation, the GTC Audacious was destroyed by pursuing Shivan bombers. We will inform the 4th Fleet of their valiant stand and mourn them in due time.

You managed to destroy the Mephisto-class freighters before they could steal some of the cargo from the depot. Denying our enemy our technology is a top priority for the Alliance, and you fulfilled this priority while under heavy fire. Excellent work.

Alpha 1, Admiral Nekba has specifically requested for you to partake in an upcoming operation of great importance to the fleet. You will return to this briefing room in one hour. It seems your skills have not gone unnoticed, Terran.", 6000)

Additionally, it is unfortunate that you were unable to prevent the seizure of allied material by the Shivans. Denying the Shivans access to our technology is an important objective of the GTVA. While ultimately the mission was a success, we will have to work harder if we are to make it back to allied space.
