The consequence of this is slightly reduced armour and speed compared to the Iceni, but the Saphah remains a powerful vessel.  Rumours that major security breaches during the NTF conflict that led to the Iceni's escape were engineered in order to gather data on the vessel for Project Saphah have been strenuously denied by the heads of GTVI."

Borrowing much from the lessons learned from the DH variant, the Hydra is both faster and more maneuverable than either of its earlier counterparts. In many ways, the Hydra is a true fighter bomber. Although it lacks in gun mount capacity, this ship has now been modified so that it can carry the powerful UD-8 Kayser. Given it's multirole capacity, GTVA command expects that the Hydra will be put into general use in the near future."

Five years have passed since the jump nodes to the Capella system were collapsed, sealing off a massive wave of Shivan juggernaughts and preventing them from pushing further into GTVA space. The supernova and subsequent nebula hang like a growing scar throughout the GTVA as light from that event continues to spread across our worlds."

The loss of Capella created serious economic hardship throughout the Alliance - a new Great Depression is upon us. The complete loss of the planetary resources and economic foundation of a rich world was devastating in its own right, but that is not all. Two hundred million refugees continue to walk the stars, seeking a new home. Some have settled, while others have been forced to move from place to place, hoping that the next place may welcome them with open arms."

While the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance continues to hold, the current depression has given way to political instability. Local governments rise and fall as often as lunar tides, organized crime and piracy have prospered in a black market environment. It seems no one is immune. Radical voices are raising echoes not heard since the blood cries of the Neo-Terran Front. The ghosts of the past are catching up with us."

Since collapsing the Capella jump nodes, the recovering GTVA fleets have spent much of their time and resources in police actions.

Fortnight Update

I trust you are settling in well, pilot, now that you have been with us for more than two weeks. To be honest, aside from the recent excitement with the Blackbeard pirate raid near the Station, not much else happens out here. You're about to get a taste of the less exciting parts of life in the boondocks. Unfortunately, I am not much for motivational speeches, especially when we have work that needs to be done.

While Tau Sigma has been settled as a mining colony for over fifteen years, very little of the system has been marked for navigation. As a result, there are many hazardous regions of the star system that require navigational beacons, to ensure safe passage in these areas. Until now, only a small number of beacons have been set around the system. They mark the critical commercial lanes, particularly near the mining operations. However, GTVA Command informs us that in the coming months, the traffic to Tau Sigma will increase significantly. There is a need to step up the schedule of navigational beacon deployment.

Report to briefing for your specific assignment."

Your $b Myrmidon fighters are being modified to carry several of these beacons. They will become available to deploy under your control when you reach the designated area for that marker. In order to make room to carry these navigation beacons, your primary weapons have been limited, and your secondary banks have been reduced in capacity."

5854, "Due to the length of this mission, you and your wingmates will be flying in shifts. You will take turns sleeping as you make your patrol rounds. While asleep, your navigation systems will be locked into your wingmates'. In the event of any danger, you will be automatically alerted, and your systems brought online."

5855, "Each fighter wing has been assigned to lay markers in three different locations in the star system. $f Alpha, your task is simple. In each designated area, you are to make a clean sweep, noting any hazards, and dropping the navigational beacons in their appropriate area.

Once this is all over, we hope to make $b Tau $b Sigma much more accessible to those wishing to develop this region. "

While you will still lay the navigational buoys, your first task will be to guard the freighters by elminating any pirates, and  clearing a path for them through the asteroid field.

Once they have jumped to safety, you will then continue your mission to lay the navigational beacons."

5995, "What these freighters were doing in these uncharted lanes, we still don't know. However, given the recent attack at Tau Sigma Station, and these raiders, it seems as if a peaceful tour of duty out here is no longer possible. We are going to have to start taking some action, especially if refugees from Capella may well be coming our way."

5996, "You managed to protect the De Leon freighter from both the Raiders and from the asteroid threat. You are to be commended for your quick thinking."

5997, "Unfortunately, the De Leon succumbed to raider fire and the impact of several dangerous asteroids. The crew managed to escape, but we have received a complaint over the loss of this freighter."

5998, "Stick close to the De Leon. Ultimately, you won't be able to save the Benzia, so keep the fighters and the asteroids off of the De Leon."

5999, "The De Leon's crew managed to get to the escape pod and jump back to Tau Sigma Station. We are fortunate that there was no loss of life this time."

Nonetheless, a Morgan representative has indicated their displeasure at having lost the Benzia freighter."

6268, "Holy crap! What the hell is that?"

6269, "Oh boy, now we've really stepped in it, big time."

6288, "Personal Log: Governor Raymond Francis M'kembe
Date: November 13, 2372

It has been just over five years since the largest exodus humanity has ever seen. Towards the end of the Neo-Terran Front rebellion, an ancient portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system. It had been activated by the NTF, opening the doorway to another confrontation with the Shivans. 

In our arrogance, we thought we had learned from our experience thirty-two years ago. Nietzche once said, 'That which does not kill us, makes us  stronger.' We believed him. Our trust in our technology and our alliances made us overconfident. We assumed we could overcome any obstacle, and that nothing could stand in our way. When the Shivans came again, we thought, like Jerusalem of old, that our walls would never fall."

6289, "But the prophets cried out, warning of doom on the horizon. We ignored them, believing the lie that we had made for ourselves. The lesson, like the universe, was harsh, and we had forgotten it. We forgot that we had paid the price with our homeworlds. We were cut off from Sol and Earth, Vasuda Prime had been laid waste. Scattered across many systems, our colonies became our havens, because we had little choice. Terran, Vasudan, we walk amongst the cold space between the stars as exiles, looking for a place where we might find comfort, and most of all home."

6290, "We learned the lesson again with Capella, a place I once called home. When the Shivans came again, we fled our homes with a hope that we could soon return. We hoped that the GTVA would stop them. Yet after a short-lived victory, we saw our place in the universe. The Shivans tore through our defenses as if they were paper, batting us aside as if we were nothing but a minor annoyance. In efforts to save the rest of our colonies, the jump nodes were collapsed, and the Shivan advance stopped at Capella. 

Yet I am left to wonder. I look at the starfield from here at Altair, looking at the golden glow of the star I was born under. Yet I know this to be an illusion, this system will not see the supernova that destroyed our home for many years to come. It is a reminder of a place to which we can never return. We are exiles once again."

6291, "In all, there were some two hundred million of us cast out of Eden to walk amongst the stars. We look for a place to call home. Many resent us, because the strain on the GTVA economy has thrown us into a new depression. The Vasudans have been kind, showing us a hospitality that we never expected. The wounds of the Terran-Vasudan War still run deep, it has been heartening to discover, however, their honour and their trust. Yet perhaps they have more in common than we once thought, for they too are exiles, having a deeper understanding of what it is to never return home. 

This is why we come to Altair, the doorway to a new promised land. The systems beyond show great promise and hope of a new found freedom for our people. For the first time in many, many years, I feel hope for our future.

$f Alpha wing, you are charged with ensuring security in the area. You are responsible for not only the Governor's safety, but for the $f GTM $f Alexis and the rest of the refugee fleet."

They have been plaguing $g GTVA security forces significantly over the past few months. $b Morgan $b Technologies is one of many voices claiming that the $g GTVA does not have the ability to maintain security in this region. 

Keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. With the Governor's arrival, it is very possible that one of these pirate groups may attempt some kind of raid. Good luck pilot!"

6307, "If any security threat was perceived before, now it has become critical. Pirates operating with fighters, bombers and even a small cruiser is one thing, yet for this group to be this well armed indicates something much deeper and dangerous.

Additionally, the docking bays of the GVI Luxor were sabotaged by a substantial explosion. In doing so, the Governor's Shuttle was stranded outside the station during the firefight, leaving it vulnerable to a kidnap attempt.

It seems that Kappa wing had access to GTVA clearance codes in the system. This is a serious breach of security. Their IFF appeared as friendly so that they could approach the convoy unmolested. Fortunately, with you and Alpha 2 flying escort, you were able to pick up on the inflection of their voice and act on the situation before they could carry out their orders."

6311, "The death of Governor M'kembe is unacceptable.  His leadership will be sorely missed. We expected better from you pilot. Your poor conduct has not only seen the death of a well respected leader, but has endangered the secure future of millions of lives. "

6312, "The GVCv Qualmotep was destroyed in the firefight. Her loss is a substantial blow to security in the area. "

6314, "The Ithaca, a Deimos-class corvette represents a substantial security threat in the area. While it was driven off, we are going to have to take some steps to track it down.

We were fortunate that the GTFf Cypher was in the area, and helped drive off this pirate attack. However, details of their presence in the system is classified. You are not to discuss this matter, even amongst your wingmates."

6315, "Unfortunately, the food convoy fell under attack on the way to their station. The loss of this part of the convoy is serious enough that we will have to look at alternative means of feeding the Capellan Refugees."

6316, "The GTM Alexis was destroyed enroute to Luxor Station. We are more than disappointed, pilot. Over 3,000 lives were lost when she went up. This will be reflected on your permanent record. "

6317, "The GTM Alexis successfully made it to her rendezvous point. As flagship of the Capellan flotilla, she will hold position at Luxor Station to supervise the operation. Hopefully, the quarantine of the jump node will be short lived, and the Capellans will be able to establish a new home. "

Luxor Station
Hunt for the Ithaca

Four days have passed since the attack by the mercenary group upon the Capellan refugees entering at the GVI Luxor. Thankfully all that was destroyed were a few containers of food. Morgan Technologies has generously offered aid to the refugees until the subspace corridor to Tau Sigma is reopened.

All has remained quiet in Altair since the attack, and despite numerous searches, we have been unable to locate the Ithaca, the mercenary corvette."

6417, "Attack on GTSC Berkeley

However, at 1046 Terran Standard Time we received a distress call from the GTSC Berkeley. This Terran science cruiser was studying magnetic field anomalies near the Casa belt, a scattered asteroid belt between Altair 3 and Altair 4.

The Berkeley reported that it was under attack from a Deimos-class corvette. Based on this data and the events of the past four days, we must assume this to be the Ithaca. The Ithaca destroyed the Berkeley at 1052 hours."

6418, "Security Risk

The threat the Ithaca poses is extreme. We cannot ignore it, nor can we wait for GTVA fleet assets to reinforce us. By that time the Ithaca may have moved on. We must deal with the Ithaca at once.

Unfortunately, the GVCv Qualmotep was severely damaged in its last engagement. Despite repairs, it is still not fit for battle. The Qualmotep will have to fight at long range, if at all. Still, at this point we have little choice."

6419, "Terran Fighter Repairs

Regrettably, we have been unable to repair the damage which your Myrmidon fighters sustained during the engagement in the Altair-Tau Sigma jump corridor. We lack the parts required for a full refit of a Terran fighter. The Myrmidons will never fly again.

You will have to make use of the Vasudan fighters which we have available. Fortunately, we have enough spare fighters for you to use and some fighters modified for Terran use. Get used to them, you may not be flying Terran issues for a while to come.

Report to mission briefing on the double, pilots."

6420, "As you are all well aware, the $h Ithaca must be dealt with immediately.  Latest data shows it to be seeking refuge in the $b Casa $b Belt. The belt's composition prevents sensors from penetrating it. We believe that the $h Ithaca is making repairs within the belt."

6421, "Because of its intelligence value alone, we must attempt to capture the $h Ithaca. This will also eliminate the threat posed by the vessel without having the $f Qualmotep engage it in direct combat."

6422, "$f Alpha wing, flying $b Horus fighters, will be integral to this mission's success. You must plant a $b TAG guidance beacon on the $h Ithaca's hull. Evade the fighters guarding the corvette until this task is complete. Our data suggests four to five fighters, all damaged, guarding the $h Ithaca."

6423, "Sentry"

6424, "The $f GVCv $f Qualmotep will then engage the $h Ithaca at long range using overcharged beam cannons. The weapons will only have enough energy for a few shots, so the $f Qualmotep may need your help to disable the $h Ithaca. For this reason the $b Akheton $b SDG disruptor cannon has been made available to you, if you wish to use it. However, you will be required to modify your loadout if you wish to use this weapon. You may vary your loadout if you wish, though the $b TAG missiles will be required for the mission. The $f GVA $f Neith will be providing a sensor scrambler field to prevent the detection of the $f Qualmotep by the $r mercenaries. $f Alpha wing will then deal with the defending fighters."

6425, "Neith"

6426, "Once the $h Ithaca is disabled and the area secure, the $f GVT $f Isiroth will enter the area to secure the $h Ithaca and her crew. The mercenary vessel will be in no shape to put up a fight, so hopefully they'll surrender peacefully. If they do not, $f Alpha wing will disarm them as well. When we have the $h Ithaca's crew, you will be authorised to depart.

Good hunting, $f Alpha."

6427, "The apparent self-immolation of the crew of the Ithaca cannot be readily explained, especially considering their last words. It appears that they were as taken by surprise as we were. We suspect that the destruction of the Ithaca was linked to the unusual sensor readings recorded by Alpha 2 just prior to the explosion. The sensor data is under analysis now.

The crew of the GVT Isiroth were killed in action. However, their honourable death was not entirely in vain, for we have at least removed the threat the Ithaca posed."

6428, "Alpha wing, with the tools available to you the task you were given should not have been difficult. Your failure to provide fire support for the Qualmotep and disable the Ithaca has resulted in it's disappearance, for the second time. We have been unable to track the vessel, though we have received reports that another Capellan food convoy was hit by the Ithaca at 0315 hours."

6429, "The mercenary wings which threatened us were all destroyed by you and your wings. For this you are to be commended. In the fight against pirates and mercenaries, we need to retain the upper hand."

SOC Reassignment

Welcome to Special Operations Command, pilots. This is Jonas Ekestam, captain of the GTCv Escher. Not many are recruited into our ranks, but when they are, they are pilots of the highest calibre. After your performance defending the Escher from pirates, as well as excellent performance in several other missions, we have decided that those pilots who flew Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 in previous missions will fill the gaps in our deep cover team."

6560, "Deep Cover Brief

Deep cover missions are carried out behind enemy lines with little or no logistical support. You've got to be tough to make it through a mission like this, but we're sure you'll be able to manage."

6561, "Tau Sigma Mercenaries

The subject of this operation is the mercenary group operating out of Tau Sigma - also active in Altair - that we believe are responsible for numerous attacks on GTVA targets. We must discover to whom these mercenaries report, and who has been leaking them and other groups sensitive information about GTVA ship movements."

6562, "Undercover Contact

Your contact on this mission will be Lieutenant Tom Faulkner. Faulkner infiltrated the mercenary group five weeks ago and has been investigating ever since. He'll teach you all you need to know about deep cover ops."

6563, "Rendezvous with Mercenaries

The SOC have certain privileges and the Escher is able to travel through the subspace corridor to Tau Sigma despite the blockade. We'll be dropping you off at a rendezvous point in Altair before travelling on to Tau Sigma Station, where we have some supplies to deliver."

6564, "Denial of Knowledge

Good luck, pilots. This will be a difficult assignment, but I'm sure we have the right pilots for the job. Remember that if you are uncovered, the SOC will disavow all knowledge of your assignment. Agents are provided with cyanide capsules for a reason. I'm sure I needn't spell it out."

6565, "Good morning, pilots. I'm Lieutenant Tom Faulkner, your contact inside the $b mercenary $b group for the duration of this operation. Our principal objective here is to discover to whom these mercs report, and who has been supplying them with sensitive information about $g GTVA movements. We have you a fairly routine job today. We are to guard a cargo depot belonging to our mysterious employer."

6570, "I'll be flying $f Shadow $f 2. Your ship has been fitted with a secure channel communications device, which will allow you to speak to other members of $f Shadow wing without the other $b mercenaries listening in. They should interpret your communications as systems diagnostic and targeting data.  The device was tested extensively during the $g GTVA's conflict with the $r Neo-Terran $r Front and should work perfectly."

Watch yourselves out there, pilots, and good luck."

6573, "Cargo"

6574, "Shadow, you did an excellent job of protecting the cargo from the pirates. It seems that these pirates are somewhat more organised and devious than most of the other groups operating in the system. They could pose a more serious threat to us than we had initially thought."

6575, "All of the pirate raiders were destroyed before they could make off with any of the cargo. What would have happened to us if they had got hold of the cargo doesn't bear thinking about."

6576, "The RGFr Sophron was saved with our help. This freighter belongs to Redman-Gray, a major Capellan mining corporation now trying to set itself up here in Tau Sigma. However, larger companies such as Morgan have quite a stranglehold on the local mining market. You'll be pleased to hear that we did get a small bonus for our effort."

6577, "The cargo containers seem to hold equipment for freighters and mining operations. Unfortunately, this doesn't really tell us a great deal. There are many mining companies in this system alone, and that cargo could belong to any one of them. The jamming equipment, however, is intriguing."

6578, "What we did out there today has shown the mercenaries that we can be trusted. Bearing our precarious position in mind, we could do with as much of their trust as we can get."

6579, "Despite the number of mercenary fighters defending the small depot, we failed to protect it from a small group of disorganised pirates."

6580, "Destroy or disable the freighters as soon as possible."

6581, "Some of the raiders got away. No doubt that the next time they attack they'll be better prepared and armed. This pirate group seems better organised than the rest. We'll have to keep a close eye on them."

6583, "The RGFr Sophron was destroyed by the pirate raiders. While the destruction of this mining freighter means little to us, any loss of civilian life should be prevented. The mercs won't be too happy that their chance of getting a reward has slipped away."

6584, "Leave Shadow and Kidd wings alone to guard the Sophron."

6585, "You had ample time to scan the cargo at the depot, Shadow 1. Those containers could have held the key to this whole mystery."

6586, "Scan the cargo at the start of the mission."

We could have done to succeed in the mission in order to gain the mercenaries' trust. We can only hope that our next mission gives us a chance to redeem ourselves."

6588, "Your desertion put the entire wing under suspicion, pilot. Sneaking off in the middle of a mission did not give a good impression, and our already precarious position with them has been weakened further.

I'm dropping you from the team, pilot. You aren't suited to deep cover operations, evidently. With luck, they won't even know you're gone.

However, the armaments on the fighters are considerably below the norm. It will also still jump to $f Luxor $f Station if we fail to intercept it.

Needless to say, you do NOT tell anyone this. Do so and our cover's blown for sure. I'm not sure how the mercs would react, but suffice it to say that swallowing that cyanide capsule would probably be a more comfortable death. Now get down to the fighter bays, they're waiting for us."

Hostile fighters from an unknown group attacked the science vessels at the site of the derelict. All we know about them is that they are extemely well-equipped, possessing fighters that are special issue only in the GTVA today."

Most of the research data from the Nyarlathotep was saved and we have invaluable eyewitness accounts of the attack. When the Escher neared the Nyarlathotep, they did not discover any hostile craft or tampering with the Shivan vessel of any kind, but all other friendly craft had been annhilated."

However, no hostiles were located.  It is unfortunate that the Los Alamos and Tesla were not saved.

More distressingly, the Escher was to be key in bringing the Nyarlathotep out of the node and into GTVA hands. Furthermore, the corvette was also to have had a role in defusing a situation at Tau Sigma Station, the soon-to-be home of the Shivan derelict. With the loss of the Escher, a new corvette not burdened by other duties will have to be found - a process that could take weeks, if not months."

It is amazing how many times throughout history people have used this passage to point out evil somewhere else. The great doomsayers of the late 20th Century turned this into an ill-conceived art. John of Patmos was not writing in some kind of mystical code pointing to some obscure figure in the future, but to the reality of evil in our midst. Through metaphor and imagery, John pulled back the curtain of reality to look at ourselves more deeply. Yet we have always wanted to put the blame elsewhere. The Shivans or the Vasudans have been an unfortunate convenience for our darker nature. In looking somewhere else, we don't realize what we ourselves are capable of...

Unfortunately, your return will not be as warmly received as it was the first time. In the three weeks since the $b Tau $b Sigma-Altair jump corridor was quarantined, supplies have not been getting through to the station. While there is another jump corridor into the region, it is far less stable and requires travel through the uncontrolled systems beyond $b Regulus.

As a result, the residents have been cut off without much more than emergency supplies, and $b Tau $b Sigma is now in a state of unrest."

They, along with a group of freighters, gas miners, and other cargo ships have formed a blockade in protest of the $g GTVA's closure of the jump corridor. At this time, we do not know their demands.

If we do not, the corridor will become too unstable to support the flood of $g Capellan refugees now gathering in $b Altair."

It seems the crew of the Clement were experienced enough with the main guns of the Fenris cruiser, that they panicked and began firing on the Nyarlathotep. Failing reason, the Escher ordered you to destroy the forward beam cannon of the Clement, which you did quickly and efficiently."

It seems that they were intending to instigate a riot all along, hopefully killing Adam Tarovich in the melee."

Since the mysterious closure of the Altair jump node in Tau Sigma over three weeks ago, civilians in the beleaguered system had not been receiving pay or supplies. The situation had grown desperate, with civilians living on emergency rations alone until yesterday, when disgruntled inhabitants of Tau Sigma station took to their vessels or simply seized whatever they could lay hands on and formed a blockade at the jump node to voice their protest."

7066, "The Tau Sigma Riot

The protesters met a GTVI group entering through the Altair jump node, demanding pay and better conditions. The GTVI vessels, however, were not prepared to negotiate and demanded that the protesters move their ships from the vicinity of the subspace node. However, the protesters refused point-blank and were met with a terrifying sight as a result - a Lucifer class destroyer, only the second vessel of its type ever encountered."

7067, "Chaos and Anarchy

The appearance of this destroyer sent a wave of panic through the crowds, sparking off a riot. As GTVA forces battled to protect civilians, hired union-busters made an attempt on the life of the protest leader, Adam Tarovich. The appearance of pirates did nothing to improve matters and the peaceful blockade ended in bloodshed and a spiralling death toll, now estimated at several hundred."

7068, "GTVA Response

GTVA Local Command refuses to comment on this incident or the purpose of bringing the SD Nyarlathotep out of the subspace corridor other than to say that the destroyer posed a 'considerable risk to the long-term stability of the subspace tunnel'. The Shivan derelict has now been towed into the vicinity of Tau Sigma station, presumably for research purposes."

Reinforcements from other nearby GTVA systems are on the way to secure the Nyarlathotep and to deal with the growing pirate threat in the region. The Altair node has been re-opened and trade routes re-established. For the moment, it seems some measure of normality has returned to the distant colony system.

7073, "$f Alpha wing will lead this operation. You'll arrive on the far side of the scrapyard and proceed towards the $f Lonewolf. If the crew won't surrender, disable her - this, however, is a last-ditch option. If it seems that the civilians will not surrender, you will however be authorised to carry out the attack."

7077, "With our recent efforts to quell $r pirate activity in $b Tau $b Sigma, there should be no expected attack from any pirates. If there are, keep the $h Lonewolf and the transport safe. The crew of the $h Lonewolf may be rioters, but they're civilians all the same. Take care when dealing with them. We've lost enough dignity with the fiasco that was the riot, and we don't need any more, that's for sure. Capturing the $h LoneWolf would certainly be some kind of victory for us."

7078, "Thanks to your efforts, a devious pirate attack was thwarted and the GTC Lonewolf has been returned to us only slightly the worse for wear. The repairs will not take too long to carry out, and the Lonewolf should be back on active service for your next sortie.

With this in mind, we are assembling a strike mission. Time is of the essence. We have a small window of opportunity, as the primary forces guarding the depot are now at their weakest. Even then, it will not be easy. "

7175, "The depot is still guarded by a wing of Hercules class fighters, designated $h White wing. Additionally, the supplies is guarded by no less than twenty sentry guns. The fighters are a credible threat, but the sentry guns are lethal. We will not have enough time to individually destroy each sentry gun to clear a path for our bombers. "

Regardless of their political or criminal leanings, destroying the $h Vigilant is not an acceptable option. However, by destroying the $b radar $b dish on the $h Vigilant, we will temporarily knock out control of the sentry guns."

7178, "$f Alpha wing, your task is threefold - first, eliminate the fighter cover. Second, destroy the radar dish aboard the $h Vigilant, and third, destroy as much of the ammunition supply depot as possible."

You will need to place your shots carefully. A well placed $b Cyclops bomb will be the most effective means to destroy the depot."

7180, "Remember, time is of the essence. We estimate that reinforcements are due to arrive in under ten minutes after you jump in. Hit them as hard as you can, and then get out. The $h Vigilant MUST survive the attack. Remember, we are soldiers, not butchers. We must do our best to protect civilian life, even if they fight against us. 

Report to the flight deck, pilots. "

7182, "While speed is essential, the need for accuracy in this mission was also necessary. The destruction of of the Vigilant is unacceptable in this kind of work. You can be sure of severe disciplinary action. If you end up without prison time, I will be very surprised. Get out of my sight."

At the head of the MT armed force is the MTD Auriga, a heavily modified Orion-class destroyer. You saw what it did out there, pilots. The Auriga poses a grave threat to the security of the region. It's full capabilities remain unknown, but it is clearly very powerful. Scouting sorties to ascertain the vessel's capability will be launched as soon as it is located.

From the transmissions sent by the crew of the Event Horizon it appears that Morgan Technolgies has been responsible for the string of attacks on GTVA and civilian targets. The mercenaries were employed by Morgan, but refused to do all of their dirty work for them. It seems that some of the attacks have been on questionable moral ground.

We have already sent encoded messages to GTVI and the GTVA Security Council in Delta Serpentis.

It is a work of art, its lines and curves aesthetically pleasing in their own dark way. Some of these structures look like they have been grown, not built. We have had to make special adaptations just to get our people around these oddly shaped corridors."

7493, "Who could imagine that the Shivans had culture? There is a sense of pride in what I see is around me, and yet I am repulsed to know that vessels like this destroy entire civilizations. Perhaps it was this very ship that eradicated the Ancients thousands of years ago. To be surrounded by something this significant, the passion of my calling, but why do I have this overriding urge to go home?

The recent business with Morgan Technologies has me concerned. Our research is supposed to be for the benefit of the Terran and Vasudan races. Now I find out that MT has been using their influence to gain political control of the region. They even killed some of my colleagues to get their people on board the Nyarlathotep. Maybe that's why I want to go home - even with the MT employees now in custody, I don't trust the people I am working with, and I never feel like I am alone.

Given the union backlash that we have witnessed in the recent riots, and their recent attempt to silence mercenary groups, $b MT personnel may well be a target for vengeful $r pirates. Like it or not, $f Alpha, you have to make sure they make it safely out of the system."

7497, "Once the $b MTT $b Irving finishes loading their remaining scientists, she will disembark from the $f Docking $f Station holding the $h SD $h Nyarlathotep. They have reported some delays in locating some of their personnel, but should be ready to pull away by the time your wing rendezvous with them."

7498, "You will then escort the $b Irving to the $b Altair jump node, being wary of any $r pirates or other forces wishing to harm the $b MT scientists. You may not like this assignment, pilot, but their safety is our concern to ensure that the guilty may be appropriately convicted. Remember, there are many within the $b MT payroll who are not privy to their activities in recent months. "

7500, "At present, we are still not entirely sure what happened. Any crew that were on board the Shivan SuperDestroyer when the SCv Tsathoggua arrived are officially listed as missing and presumed dead. This also includes the Morgan Technologies team that did not report in."

7501, "From what little we can gather from the report of the scientists, the Nyarlathotep is a partially organic ship. It seems to be self-aware, as it responded to the threat of the pirate cruiser Nero several weeks ago. However, in addition to that, it seems that there were many Shivan hidden aboard in some sort of statis field. Darvin's team must have discovered the Nyarlathotep's secret, triggering the entire ship to wake up."

Tau Sigma Station
The Hunt for the Nyarlathotep

It has been six days since the SD Nyarlathotep sprang to life and carved its way out of its holding docks at Tau Sigma Station. Even with full patrols scouring Tau Sigma, there is no sign of the superdestroyer or the SCv Tsathoggua, the corvette that assisted its escape. Even with the many navigation and scanning beacons added to the system in recent weeks, finding an object 3,000 metres long in a star system many millions of kilometres across is nearly an impossible task."

It is difficult to stress the severity of the situation. The Nyarlathotep is a Shivan Lucifer-class destroyer, the same type of vessel that rendered the surface of Vasuda Prime uninhabitable almost forty years ago. While considerably smaller than the Sathanas-class juggernauts, the Nyarlathotep wields only slightly less firepower. In battle simulations from the information we gathered, we now know that the much larger GTVA Colossus would only have had a 22% chance of surviving an encounter with this vessel. While the point is now moot, the reason for our full alert status is anything but."

The GTD Valhalla is moving to Tau Sigma to take command and coordinate the search for the Nyarlathotep and Tsathoggua. In the meantime, we are attempting to evacuate any civilian personnel from the system. This is inclusive of any of the pirate groups that have been causing us problems over the past several months. If they ask for assistance, we are under orders to help them. However, they may not be as willing to believe that as you are."

There is also the other variable: The Morgan Technologies destroyer Auriga is also a credible threat in the system, and at present we do not know if she will be willing to cooperate in our efforts against this new Shivan problem.

However, due to the fact that the $r pirates have made no hostile actions beyond stopping the $b Atlantica, and the possibilty of help from the $r pirate groups in $b Tau $b Sigma in combating the $r Shivans, $g Command has requested that the $r pirates be disabled, not destroyed.

The $b Atlantica will also have to put some distance between itself and the planet before jumping back to $f Tau $f Sigma $f Station. You will be required to protect the $b Atlantica as she prepares to jump. Watch her, she's a vulnerable vessel, and is carrying approximately one thousand civilians."

Since it appears that we cannot trust you to stick to your orders, you are hereby grounded until further notice. We're loathe to lose valuable pilots at a time like this, but we'd rather the few and competent than the many and disobedient. Dismissed."

It is a testament to your flying skills that you protected such a vulnerable vessel from an onslaught like that. The crew and passengers of the Atlantica are grateful for your efforts. It seems that this success has improved public support for the GTVA around here a little."

In a chaotic situation, you kept your cool and were able to prevent the Andrasta from coming to any harm. Good work. The Shivans tried to ambush us, and it was only thanks to the appearance of the Valhalla and the advance elements of the task force that we got you and the Andrasta out alive. Nevertheless, your work defending the Andrasta until help could arrive was essential."

7761, "The appearance of two more Shivan vessels with the Tsathoggua, along with considerable numbers of fighters and bombers suggests something larger than we'd initially hoped for. The Shivans also seem to possess far greater situational awareness than anticipated. The GTVA Task Force has now arrived in system and has begun to secure the area around the Phi Eridani jump node. Clearly accurate reconnaissance on the Shivan presence will be required before any action is taken if we don't want to be ambushed again. We will exercise caution in our future attacks."

7762, "In addition to achieving our primary objective of sizing up the Shivan presence, we were able to destroy the SC Nightgaunt and the Tsathoggua. This is excellent news. If we can continue to defeat the Shivan vessels in this manner, victory will come swiftly and decisively."

7763, "Your inability to defend the Andrasta from the Shivan ambush was disappointing, pilot. While we would not have been able to garner much information about Phi Eridani however this engagement had turned out, the loss of a corvette is a blow that we shouldn't have had to take. Furthermore, the Shivans that destroyed the Andrasta continue to guard the Tau Sigma jump node, making any incursion into Phi Eridani far, far more difficult than expected.

While the Valhalla and its escort are ready and willing to enter Shivan space, this failure is not an auspicious start to the operation. Luckily for you, you will not be present - Command has decided that you'd be better off elsewhere, back flying deep space patrols for Tau Sigma Station.

GTD Valhalla
The Superdestroyer Discovered

Okay pilots, we've found the Nyarlathotep. She is hiding in a stellar gas cloud within the Phi Eridani system. Given the presence of both the Tsathoggua and the Tulzscha in system, this setup indicates something much more widespread and dangerous than even the Nyarlathotep by herself. These ships had to come from somewhere, and GTVI is still puzzled as to their source. The only current speculation that we have is that the Nyarlathotep was part of a larger fleet that has been lying dormant in subspace for thousands of years. Dr. Hadamard's speculation that the Nyarlathotep was indeed the Lucifer that destroyed the civilization of the Ancients seems both the most plausible and the most troubling."

7827, "Origins of the Derelict

The Nyarlathotep herself was residing dormant in subspace until a few weeks ago, when she emerged through a rift created by the explosion of the MT Mudenerei AWACs. While it was not clear at the time who was controlling the ships in that subspace battle, subsequent evidence has revealed that Morgan Technologies is behind much of the recent criminal activities in these systems. However, the Nyarlathotep's presence seems to be just the beginning of something darker."

7828, "Previous Shivan Incursions

Thirty-seven years ago, the Lucifer appeared in Ross 128 with no apparent source or reason. The Shivans simply came, and even until today no one truly knows where they came from. Our recent experience has shed light on that war so many years ago, and yet it does not bode well. We barely escaped with our lives from the last Shivan invasion, and if the Nyarlathotep is not alone, the danger is greater than we first imagined."

7829, "GTVA Response

We need information, and we need it now. We have pinpointed the location of the Nyarlathotep, but we do not know her present activities. Before we launch any kind of a strike, we are going to need some accurate information on her location and her status. We are fortunate to have a handful of Mara class fighters in our possession that have been converted so that Terran pilots can fly them. 

I hope you've been brushing up on your Shivan etiquette, pilot. You're going behind the lines."

7830, "At 1715 hours, we pinpointed the source of $r Shivan transmissions in the $b Phi $b Eridani system. The $h Nyarlathotep is located in a small stellar cloud that until now, has been masking all of our scans of the system. Our recent engagements with the $h Tsathoggua and the $h Tulzscha helped us to localize the $h Nyarlathotep's haven. At present, the $f GTD $f Valhalla is on standby, and will be awaiting  with a small strike force of $g GTVA ships that will be ready to deploy in three hours. The information that you provide will be used to launch the strike against the superdestroyer."

7831, "Your task is simple. In captured $b Mara fighters, get close enough to the $h Nyarlathotep and scan her $b Navigation, $b Communications, $b Sensors, $b Weapons and $b Fighterbay subsystems. Your fighters will appear to be $r Shivan, right down to your EM signatures - provided that you do not get too close to patrolling $r Shivans. The interference created by the stellar gas cloud should provide you with enough cover. However, steer clear of the other $r Shivan fighter patrols in the area. If they get too close, you will be readily identified. "

7832, "Given the $h Tulzscha's escape when the $h Tsathoggua was destroyed, we expect this $b Lilith class cruiser to be in the area. If it is present, scan the cruiser, and any other capital ships you find. Do not engage any ships, or it will ruin the element of surprise. 

Keep a low profile, $f Alpha. Remember to keep at least 500 metres between yourself and the fighter patrols."

7833, "Good work, pilot, you managed to scan the Tulzscha and Nyarlathotep's systems as you requested. Unfortunately, upon your initial broadcast, the GTD Valhalla's strike force launched a pre-emptive assault against the Nyarlathotep without your additional information of the growing battlegroup. We managed to signal her in time to pull out of the attack, but at the cost of burning out her jump engines. At present, the Valhalla is stranded in another part of the nebula.  "

7834, "Unfortunately, you let Aries wing get too close to you before you were able to gather the necessary information. We are no further ahead than when we were before. The Nyarlathotep has changed her location within the Stellar Gas Cloud, and we have no idea where she will be turning up next.

Presently the GTD Valhalla is attempting a deep range scan on the edge of the cloud, but so far is not having any luck. You will join her crew in the ongoing search for the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzcha."

7835, "When your wingmates tell you that Aries wing is getting too close, you need to stop completely and let them pass. If any one of those fighters gets within 200 metres of you, the jig is up and everything goes hostile."

7836, "Pilot, there was no reason for you to leave the area whatsoever. You had not been discovered by the Shivans, and you had not completed your scans of the Nyarlathotep. Your dereliction of duty has cost us dearly, since we know even less than we did before. This is going on your permanent record.

GTD Valhalla
The Failure of Subterfuge

Since we were unable to gain any significant information about the Nyarlathotep and the Tulzscha before the Shivans were alerted to your presence, the GTD Valhalla called off her pre-emptive strike. Instead, we are now engaging in search and destroy operations within the Phi Eridani system. Hopefully we will be able to prevent the Shivans from establishing any kind of foothold in this system. Their resources are limited, and the Nyaralthotep will need to establish supply chains to sustain any kind of territorial operations. If we can prevent those chains from ever forming, then we can ensure that this new problem will be nothing more than a footnote in the GTVA's history with the Shivans."

Alpha, you will assist the GTD Valhalla and the GTCv Escher in their search and destroy operations. Presently, they are following another lead in locating the SC Tulzscha. The Tulzscha may be attempting to establish a supply line. If we intercept this cruiser, then we'll be able to starve the Nyarlathotep and force it into making a hasty move.

At 2326 hours, we intercepted a transmission that originates within the Tulzscha. She appears to be stationary and may be vulnerable to a strike. Report to briefing."

7990, "$f Alpha, your task is to eliminate the fighter escort and help the $f Escher destroy the $h Tulzscha's engines and communication systems. We want to prevent her from leaving the area, or calling for help. Once disabled, the Valhalla will deploy recovery vessels to launch a capture assault on the $h Tulzscha. She may not have the same value as the $h Nyarlathotep, but she is much more of an asset to us intact."

Good hunting, pilot."

Perhaps if we had gained more information in the nebula, things would have worked out differently. Less than a quarter of the Valhalla's crew managed to make it to the escape pods.

Also saddening is the destruction of the GTCv Escher. While there was no way that you could have saved the Valhalla, the survival of the Escher was within your grasp. It is a shame that the corvette did not escape this ambush.

These twin losses have blasted a vast hole in our Eridani expeditionary force, and any hope of withdrawing and living to fight another day has gone.

Despite the recent incidents at both the Altair and Tanis Australis jump nodes in the Tau Sigma system, we seemed to have contained the Shivan advance within the system.

We suspect that these two recent attacks that the Shivans were testing the resolve of GTVA forces in the area. It is fortunate that the presence of the MTD Auriga made the defenses at Tania Australis seem stronger than they were. We expect that the Shivans are gathering their strength for a strike, but we are sorely lacking any intelligence as when and where it may come. Fortunately, a squadron of Pegasus class stealth fighters has now been brought on station for a series of recon missions."

Beta wing will be flying reconnaissance into Phi Eridani to determine the extent of Shivan fortifications around the jump node and in that system. Kappa will be investigating recent Shivan activity in the outer system and tracing their supply line routes. So far, our sensor arrays have not been able to determine any of this, so we need first-hand intelligence.

Why they have chosen this location is a mystery, as there are no apparent resources anywhere close to their staging area. "

Morgan Technologies sought to gain control of the Tau Sigma system in order to exploit the high potential of the system. The corporation attempted to destabilise the region and undermine GTVA control with a series of strikes on civilian targets by hired mercenaries. The MT defence force was intended to replace the GTVA as dominant military power in the system once Morgan had the second thing they wanted - the two million Capellan refugees settling in Tau Sigma. With the refugees and control of the system, they had themselves a ready-made empire."

The Auriga and other MT vessels participated in attacks on civilian and GTVA forces and showed no mercy to their enemies. The GTVA considers these forces to be guilty of crimes against the Alliance and war crimes under the provisions of civilian protection decree in BETAC. The Security Council issued a warrant for the capture or destruction of the MT vessels yesterday. The Auriga and her accompanying flotilla must be brought to justice."

8382, "Giordano"

8383, "You failed to identify and capture the Morgan Technolgies vessel. Though traffic was high, this was a relatively simple task that you should've been able to complete with only basic training. The fact that you're a pilot of some skill highlights the fact that you should've carried out your mission objectives properly."

8384, "Scan all ships for MT crew until they are discovered. Follow your wingmen's suggestions as well."

8385, "Deserting the field is a serious enough offence in any mission - and a covert operation with high tactical value even more so. You failed the mission, your wingmen, and, worst of all, us at GTVI. Don't think that you'll be selected for special duties again, pilot."

8386, "You did well out there considering what we had to put up with - flying in a hot zone with many civilian targets, mistaken identity by the local security personnel, and an attack by mysterious fighters. Flying in this kind of environment always presents danger to our pilots and also to the civilians who we are sworn to protect. The risk of a shot hitting a civilian freighter or explorer is high in this kind of mission, but fortunately you showed skill and restraint, even when under fire from friendly forces. This isn't something that every pilot can boast."

8387, "The crew of the disabled MTT Juno isn't talking under conventional questioning methods, and because they're not strictly military personnel we're going to need special authorisation from GTVI HQ in Ikeya if we want to continue our inquiry. This could take some time. Nevertheless, the capture of this crew is a significant step forward. You did well out there, protecting our transport from the unwanted attention of hostile fighters. Their origin remains unknown, though it's a safe bet to assume that they were MT or pirate fighters."

8388, "The wanton destruction of the MT transport before the Giordano even had a chance to dock with it is simply unacceptable. We expect our pilots to show intelligence and restraint, and yet you have shown neither of these traits. It makes me wonder why they ever asked you back to serve again in the first place."

8389, "Don't destroy the MT transport, disable it! The crew is needed for interrogation."

8390, "The destruction of the GTT Giordano prevented us from retrieving the Morgan Technologies crew from the Juno, and so we've lost a valuable lead in addition to the loss of a fine capture crew. Lieutenant Commander Phil Barker and his team will be sorely missed by their colleagues and their families."

8391, "Protect the Juno and Giordano during docking. After that, you'll just have to concern yourself with the Giordano. She's weak, so don't let the fighters get through."

"

8531, "Okay pilots, here's the deal. We don't know how, but it looks like a group of $r MT vessels ambushed a $g GTVI convoy headed through the system of $b Tegmen in grid sector $b 320 by $b 116. The last transmission from the convoy stated that they were under attack and that several vessels had been disabled. This convoy was meant to be top-secret, and so an $r MT attack on it is of the utmost concern. It is unlikely that the $r Morgan attack group simply stumbled upon the convoy."

8532, "GTVI Convoy"

8533, "The situation with the convoy remains unknown. $f Alpha wing will be sent in to reconnoitre the area and see if there are any convoy ships remaining and what shape they're in. Our convoy consisted of the $f GTSC $f Beaufort, $f GTFr $f Aztec and the freighters $f Emza, $f Selu and $f Yar. The $f GVCv $f Sopedu and $f GVC $f Marut escorted these vessels. As you can judge by the escort, this was no ordinary convoy."

8539, "It would also be reasonable to assume that were there anything out there to salvage, $r Morgan might come back and finish what they started. The convoy possesses considerable defensive firepower but their status is unknown and if $r MT ships attack, you will be called upon to defend friendly targets in the area.

You're going out into an unknown, possibly volatile situation. Tread carefully and keep your wits about you."

8540, "MT Forces?"

8541, "Alpha and Beta wings performed acceptably in a combat situation in which details were not readily available. Because of your efforts, the recovery craft were all able to dock and escape safely with the crews of the stricken convoy craft. By all rights this situation shouldn't even have happened. The method by which Morgan Technologies obtained the co-ordinates of the convoy remains unexplained.

However, it would seem that all of your effort was in vain. The Vaisang, Kucedre and Adjmetu didn't show up at the designated rally point, and have failed to do so in the intervening hours. Our search teams have found nothing to suggest they didn't make it - not even debris. The three recovery transports, their crews and those of the convoy craft have simply vanished. Command can give no valid explanation for this."

8542, "The freighters Emza and Selu both escaped with their crews. This may only be a small number of personnel to survive, but if our operations have saved only one person then they have not been in vain."

8543, "The recovery craft were destroyed along with the crews of the convoy craft by MT bombers and other, unknown attackers. Without the accounts of the crews, and with the surviving convoy craft so badly damaged as to be useless, we may never know quite what happened out there. You let down hundreds of Terrans and Vasudans out there, pilots."

8544, "Defend the convoy craft from all attack.  By delivering slight damage to fighters you can provoke them to break off their attacks."

8545, "We have not been able to determine the origin of your mysterious attackers either, though they do not appear to be MT vessels or belong to any local pirates. The GTC Deus, however, was a vessel dispatched by no less than GTVI High Command to destroy the convoy craft once they had been evacuated to prevent them falling into enemy hands."

The bitter lessons of the past should teach us hard truths for the future, yet time and again the human race has failed to learn from its mistakes, rise up to the challenges set by new situations and new enemies. In our arrogance we have believed for centuries that no enemy will survive contact with our plans. In truth no plan of ours will survive contact with the enemy. Pride comes before a fall, and we have been proud and have fallen many times during the past 50 years. There are simply too many variables to consider when planning an appropriate strategy.

8772, "Delphi 2372
GTD Macura
A Final Confrontation

Enough is enough. In spite of the mysterious roadblocks we've encountered, we have finally found a way to draw out the MTD Auriga. She has caused us a great number of problems over the past few weeks, from interfering with searches for the Shivans to massacring civilians and raiding scientific installations with no apparent method behind the madness. Although it is only one vessel, the Auriga has caused more damage than some small NTF battlegroups did at the height of the war. Now, we must deal with the Auriga."

8773, "Capabilities of the Auriga

The Auriga is an immensely powerful vessel, armed with heavy beam cannons and capable of far more damage than a normal Orion class destroyer. It is also protected by a limited self-repair mechanism and a beam cannon inhibition device. These pose great problems to our forces when attempting to combat the vessel."

8774, "Beam Inhibitor Technology

We now know that the inhibitor works by disrupting our ion beams with electromagnetic radiation as they form, causing them to collapse. This effect prevents friendly vessels from firing, while the Auriga itself remains unaffected. The technology appears to have been developed around the framework for Admiral Bosch's ETAK design."

8775, "Beam Cannon Workaround

Fortunately, sensor scans of the Auriga, coupled with our knowledge of the ETAK project and other pieces of data from captured MT Elite Guard crews have helped us a great deal. We believe that we have enough information to temporarily negate the beam cannon inhibitor. This will enable us to launch an attack on the Auriga on roughly even footing.

On the orders of GTVI, we are now initiating an operation to neutralise the threat posed by the Auriga."

8776, "Intelligence Directives

GTVI wants the Auriga captured, not destroyed. This will not only eliminate the threat posed by the MT destroyer, but it will give us a powerful and much-needed tool with which to fight the Shivans. The motives of the crew of the Auriga remain shrouded in mystery.  As you'd expect, GTVI want to know their motives as well."

8777, "The Auriga's Value

The Auriga is a technological treasure trove of designs thought lost during the GTI Rebellion thirty-seven years ago, plus experimental technologies that we weren't even sure were possible. How all of this found its way onto a corporate destroyer is a mystery. GTVI also believe that the Auriga has the power to take on the Nyarlathotep."

8778, "Your Task

Capturing this vessel will be a tough job, but it may be our only hope. Our best pilots have therefore been picked for the job. Get down to the briefing room, Alpha. You're going to play an instrumental role in this mission."

8779, "Alright, pilots, let's get right down to business. The $h MTD $h Auriga is cornered in $b Delphi, from which there is no apparent escape route. The only node discovered in this system thus far is too unstable for subspace travel. The $g 3rd $g Battle $g Group has been directed to assist us in this operation, so we have considerable resources available."

8780, "However, the $h Auriga will not reveal itself readily. The vessel has proven on too many occasions already it's capacity for evasion.

Fortunately our scouts have located a temporary supply depot set up by a forward group of $r MT vessels on the edge of the $b Delphi system. It is hoped that a strike at the depot will draw the $h Auriga out to defend the supplies and guard vessels."

8781, "Supply depot"

8782, "The supply depot is guarded by an $b Aeolus cruiser, the $h MTC $h Minerva, and one wing of fighters, designated $h Halberd. The supply depot attack force will consist of the $f GVCv $f Andrasta and two fighter wings, $f Alpha and $f Beta."

However, the $h Minerva must not be destroyed. She'll be used to bait the $h Auriga out into the open."

8786, "When the $h Auriga arrives, our trap will be sprung. The $f Andrasta will signal the $f GVD $f Luxor and our additional fighter and bomber reinforcements to enter the field of engagement. The $f Luxor is carrying modified sensor equipment which should allow our vessels to fire their beam weapons despite the $h Auriga's beam cannon inhibitor. The $f Luxor has also been given additional ablative armour to increase resistance to the $h Auriga's attacks."

Unfortunately, all of our preparation was for naught and the GVD Luxor has been heavily damaged.  She'll be in drydock for a month or more while the engineers fit a whole new engine array and repair the secondary damage.

However, we were able to overcome the Auriga's beam inhibition device and attack the destroyer directly. This technology will come in handy should we have to face the Auriga again. Our scientists hope to adapt the device to inhibit the beams of hostile vessels in the future as well."

8795, "Despite the failure of our primary objective, we were able to destroy all remaining Morgan Technologies vessels. The MT defence force has effectively been destroyed, the Auriga being the only surviving vessel."

8796, "Not only did the Auriga escape but we were unable to destroy the remainder of the Morgan Technologies defence forces. Although a small group, we will still have to expend time, energy and vessels to track them down, and at a time when the Shivan fleet is pushing into our core systems, these are resources we can ill afford to waste.

Nevertheless, the threat posed by the MT defence force is effectively over."

We must strike at the Shivan fleet before they can devastate our systems.

Vanishing of the Shivan Fleet

Eight days ago, the Shivans disappeared from the Tau Sigma system with no sign of where they went. Somehow, the SD Nyarlathotep summoned a device similar to the Ancient Knossos portal discovered in Gamma Draconis, with which they then stabilized a previously unknown jump node. In an instant, more than twenty capital ships suddenly vanished, with only this new mysterious subspace corridor in their wake."

A Sirian Civilian Rescue team had been sent to investigate a transmission loss from a mining operation in one of the star system's asteroid belts.

Shortly thereafter, probes confirmed that the Shivans had opened up a previously unstable jump corridor between Tau Sigma and Sirius."

Beyond the signal triangulation, we have little more information than what we already have. 

Your task is to get yourself within 200 metres of any cruiser that you find, and give us the precise coordinates and heading of that vessel. We realize this will be a tricky prospect, given that your ships have already seen heavy combat, and cruisers carry anti-fighter systems.

After the successful strike against the cruisers orbiting Sirius XII, the Shivans began to move. Fearing the worst, we allocated our heaviest armaments to defend the inhabited worlds, led by the GVD Nekhbet.

Ten days ago the SD Nyarlathotep opened a stable jump corridor between the Tau Sigma and Sirius systems. While the GTVA Science Corps had known about this corridor previously, it was then far too unstable to travel safely. It appears that the Nyarlathotep stabilised the corridor somehow.

The majority of the Shivan battlegroup has since moved out of Sirius and through Deneb, into Vega. They have not stopped to pursue any targets of opportunity unless they stood in the path of their relentless advance, as the shipyards in Sirius did. Fortunately the personnel and the photon artillery prototype under development there were successfully evacuated before the shipyard was destroyed.

While most of the Shivan capital ships have moved on to Vega, the Ravana class destroyer Azathoth and several smaller vessels remain in Deneb. We must now attempt to flush them out."

The arrival of the Shivans has brought an interesting phenomenon to light. It seems that the Nyarlathotep is still broadcasting some kind of signal to all Shivan vessels, which, it has been postulated, the Shivan vessels in the Phi Eridani stellar gas cloud homed in on. The signal has also been picked up by a Rakshasa class cruiser that the GTVI captured during the Second Great War."

After analyzing the behaviour of the Shivans, Doctor James Sheridan, an eminent scientist in the field of Shivan research, believes that we can lure the Shivans into a trap using the cruiser as bait. With any luck, the Shivans will attempt to rescue their stricken cruiser, and thus open themselves up to attack. The instrument of their destruction will be the GTVX Gorgon cannon, the most powerful defensive weapon ever constructed by the GTVA Science Corps.

An extract of Doctor Sheridan's report on the Gorgon cannon follows."

''A standard Meson bomb detonates without focus and spreads its massive destructive power in a large spherical area. By stripping out and modifying a Zephyrus class vessel, it can be used to focus the Meson charge into a coherent beam with incredible destructive potential. While the cannon is fragile and unstable, no vessel of destroyer class or below can withstand the power that it unleashes.''

We're going to be putting this to the test soon. Report to mission briefing, pilots."

9034, "$g Command has authorised the deployment of the $f GTVX $f Gorgon experimental cannon for this operation. As you have heard, the cannon focuses the energy released during a Meson reaction into a coherent beam. Although the beam is powerful, the cannon itself has a low damage threshold. It is for this reason that we are deploying a considerable defensive force to protect the $f Gorgon."

Due to the importance of this mission, you will be permitted to carry the $b UD-8 $b Kayser cannon, our most powerful primary cannon.

Bear in mind that while your primary objective will be to protect the $f Gorgon cannon, we would like the cruisers back in one piece if at all possible. We have more fronts than just this one to fight on, and we need every capital ship we can get."

Despite being crewless, its computers continue to respond to the $r Shivan signal. Our engineers stripped the cruiser of most of it's weapons and engine assembly long ago. This will at least prevent the $r Shivans from using the vessel against us or any autopilot taking over and forcing the cruiser to depart. Instead, the $r Shivans will have to come and get the cruiser themselves."

However, this victory comes at a price. The GVCv Jilvaa was annihilated by the Azathoth and the crew of the Gorgon cannon were killed in a Meson containment breach that destroyed the cannon. The loss of the prototype may be a blow, but it is the loss of life that is most terrible."

Be glad that you were not there, pilot. What we have on our hands is a rout. Without taking a single capital ship loss, the $r Shivans have already wiped out all of our fighter wings, three of our corvettes, and damaged three of our larger vessels."

Your problem is not here, pilot."

Unfortunately, the $f GTFf $f Cypher sustained damage to its subspace drive when it activated the jump and found itself adrift still within sight of the battle.

However, the $f Cypher suffered a hull breach from a beam in its engineering section, killing several critical personnel and rendering any repair equipment unusable.

Alpha wing is part of the team defending the Beta Aquilae jump node, near to Rebus Station, where most of the action is expected - including an engagement with the SD Cthon, the primary target of Alpha's bombers.
"

9179, "Vega 2372
Rebus Station
The Shivan Armada's Procession

Since the Shivan fleet jumped into the Sirius system just over a week ago and began their journey through our systems, we have desperately been trying to hold them off, slow them down, or thin them out. However, our operations have met with only limited success. While we were able to destroy the SD Azathoth with the GTVX Gorgon cannon in Deneb, we lost the prototype and several other vessels."

9180, "The Vega Engagement

In a recent engagement, an attempt to destroy the Shivan fleet failed, with the destruction of the GVD Resheph and GTD Ignatius as the result. Several smaller vessels were also destroyed and we barely dented the fleet. The official death toll stands at over 23,000, with many more missing and presumed dead. Obviously, with conventional attacks failing another method must be found to deal with the Shivans."

9181, "Unconventional Warfare

Command believes that it has discovered just such a method. A Deimos-class corvette under construction here in Vega has been modified to carry only a skeleton crew and a payload of Meson bombs. This vessel, the GTCv Argentus will be used to ram the Nyarlathotep. It is hoped that the vulnerabilities observed in the Lucifer's reactors could be capitalised upon here, though we have one available to us - the Nyarlathotep does not appear to have the same shielding that the Lucifer did."

9182, "The Ultimate Destination

We will therefore not have to destroy the Nyarlathotep within a subspace corridor and risk losing the ability to travel through the jump node, but the Shivans will not simply let us ram the Argentus into their command ship unopposed.  After monitoring Shivan fleet movements our experts believe that the Shivans' movement patterns are consistent with travel to only one destination - Beta Aquilae.  It is at the Beta Aquilae-Vega jump node that we will mount our attack on the Nyarlathotep."

9183, "New Technology

It will be a difficult task to eliminate the Nyarlathotep, but fortunately our defence forces have a new tool to aid them - the GTB Hydra. The Hydra is a next-generation refit of the GTB Artemis, a true fighter-bomber with improved armour, maneuvrability and afterburner reserves. The Hydra can also mount the UD-8 Kayser cannon, making it a formidable foe to enemy capital ships and fighters alike."

9184, "Combat Evaluation

The Hydra has been brought into service early due to the threat posed by the Shivans, so you'll be 'testing' her, so to speak, as the Hydra hasn't had an OpEval period. Use her well - basic flight trials have shown excellent potential in the vessel.

Get down to the Quarterdeck, they're waiting for you."

9185, "We mount our final set of missions in order to ensure the success of $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet commencing at 1400 hours today. The $b 144th and $f GVD $f Khefrem will flank the $r Shivan fleet while the $b 23rd provide cover for our forward observer units monitoring $r Shivan movement. The $g Vegan $g 4th $g Fleet is providing logistical support across the system and you pilots from the $b 232nd will be participating in the most critical phase of our operation, here, at the $b Beta $b Aquilae jump node."

9186, "The $b Beta $b Aquilae jump node lies between $b Vega $b IV and its moon, $b Larissa. Due to the intense gravitational forces exerted by these two bodies, ships must exit subspace some distance from the node. This means that the $r Shivans will have quite some distance to run before they can enter our core systems. The $r Shivans must pass through this area in order to enter $b Beta $b Aquilae, and it is here that $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet will take place."

If at all possible all $r Shivan incursion further into our systems must be stopped. You have been equipped with $b TAG missiles. Use them to paint targets for our defence cannons to lock onto and destroy.  "

9198, "However, our primary target will be the $h SD $h Cthon. The $b Demon class destroyer will be the $r Shivans' primary fire support vessel, housing many wings of fighters and bombers. Armed with powerful beam cannons, the $h Cthon will be more than capable of ripping our defences to pieces if we're not careful - not to mention the $f Argentus. $f Alpha and $f Beta wings, in bombers, will be charged with the destruction of this vessel. Again, once the destroyer is within range the $b Mjolnir cannons will add considerable fire support if you are able to TAG the $h Cthon for them."

9199, "Once the $f Argentus arrives, cover it from $r Shivan bombers and beam cannon fire. The $f Argentus must reach the $h Nyarlathotep in order to complete its mission. Ensure that the $f Argentus survives long enough to destroy the $h Nyarlathotep at any cost. All other objectives are secondary, as unless we can destroy the $r Shivan command vessel with this attack it is highly unlikely that our efforts to destroy it by more conventional means will succeed. However, note that the $f Argentus will explode with considerable force. Get out of harm's way if possible. Courageous pilots are one thing, martyrs quite another."

9200, "When the $h Nyarlathotep is destroyed, mop up any remaining $r Shivan vessels, making sure that the defence of surviving allied capital ships is paramount.

This is it, everyone. We stop the $r Shivans here with $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet's success or we unleash a wave of terror and destruction upon our core worlds, one from which the $g GTVA may never recover.

You have your orders, now do your people proud out there, pilots. You're making history here."

9201, "The SD Cthon broke through our defences at the Beta Aquilae jump node and entered that system. Already our forces there have sustained considerable damage in fending it and it's bomber wings off. We expect many more losses to come if something is not done quickly."

9328, "Sorry to shove you into a brand-new $b Hydra and brief you while enroute, but we don't have time. It looks like Lt. Mackie and the crew of the $f GTFf $f Cypher were right, and now we have very little time to act. The $h SD $h Nyarlathotep, and her accompanying fleet, were never on a course for $b Beta $b Aquilae, but were attempting to return home. It now appears that they might just succeed. The $h SD $h Cthon and the bulk of the $r Shivan fleet engaged our forces near the $b Beta $b Aquilae node. We destroyed the $h Cthon and seem to have the rest of that battle under control, but we may have lost the war. "

9329, "The $h Nyarlathotep is attempting to stabilize the jump node to $b Capella, which was destroyed five years ago when the $f GTD $f Nereid was detonated inside the corridor. The explosion destabilized the node, and stopped a massive $r Shivan fleet from pushing further into $g GTVA space. From our experience at the new $b Tau $b Sigma-Sirius corridor, if the $h Nyarlathotep is successful, the door to $b Capella will once again be flung wide open. We have one last hope, or we will all face annihilation."

9330, "Capella"

9331, "The $f GTFf $f Cypher has engaged the small fleet guarding the $h Nyarlathotep at the remnants of the $b Capella jump node. She has bought us enough time to rally the $f GVD $f Khefrem and the $f GVCv $f Estennu to provide support for the $f GTCv $f Argentus to make her run. $b Operation $b Silver $b Bullet may still have some life after all.

The $f Cypher has transmitted the coordinates for the superdestroyer. The $h Nyarlathotep is engaging with her weapons, but not maneuvering. It appears she must remain still in order to summon their own $b Knossos portal from subspace, and shortly thereafter stabilize the node. Our window for opportunity will be very narrow, and we will only get one shot."

9332, "In order to make this happen, our first order of business is getting the $f Cypher to safety. She is presently within beam range of several $r Shivan cruisers, and is in a direct firefight with the $h SCv $h Cthulhu. The $h Nyarlathotep has launched bombers, which are presently bearing down on the frigate. The $f Cypher is attempting to move out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep, but will need cover as soon as you arrive. "

9333, "The $f Cypher is transmitting the coordinates of the $h Nyarlathotep directly to the skeleton crew of the $f Argentus. If she is destroyed, the explosives-laden corvette will not be able to make her run. You must ensure that the $f Cypher makes it safely out of range of the $h Nyarlathotep or any capital ships in the area. The $f Khefrem and $f Estennu will provide fire support against the cruisers - your task is to intercept any bombers."

9334, "Estennu"

9335, "The $h Nyarlathotep is not unguarded. In addition to her own formidable weaponry, the $h SC $h Nyogtha and $h SC $h Tulzscha, a pair of $b Lilith class cruisers, flank her. They are armed with exceptionally powerful beam weapons, and are guarding her more vulnerable underside. Once the $f Cypher has made it to safety, the beam weapons of these cruisers are your primary target. Either destroy the turret or destroy the cruiser - just make sure they cannot fire. The $b Liliths are a tough nut to crack, so be careful in your choice of action."

9336, "Additionally, the $h Nyarlathotep's rear-most beam weapon has a field of fire that covers her underside. While not as devastating as her principal forward beams, this weapon is as powerful as the lateral cannons, and is still a major threat. If the $f Argentus is to succeed in her mission, this threat must also be eliminated."

9337, "Rear Turret"

9338, "Once these cannons are eliminated, the $f Argentus will make her attack run on the $h Nyarlathotep. Keep any stray fighters or bombers clear of her, but be careful. When the $f Argentus collides with the superdestroyer, the blast will destroy any small craft in the area. Do what you have to to succeed, but come home if you can."

9339, "I need not stress the consequences of failure, as the reopening of the $b Capella jump node will spell certain doom for all civilization as we know it. 

Go with God, pilot."

9370, "Thanks, Command, we're managing not too badly. We managed to stay in the Nyarlathotep's blind spot, but her escort are giving us a bit of trouble. We need to get clear soon, and there are incoming bombers."

9371, "Cypher, this is the Khefrem. Targeting cruisers, get yourself to safety. We will cover you."

9372, "Affirmative, Khefrem, we're going to need to get things cleared up for the Argentus."

9373, "At least the Cthon isn't here. We'd be in a lot more trouble than we are now."

9374, "You don't call this trouble? Kid, if that ship restablizes the node, we'll have a lot more than the Cthon to worry about. "

9375, "We're lucky to have the Khefrem and the Estennu - even then, the odds aren't great."

9376, "Shut up about the odds and get to work. I don't gamble. We need to clear that path for the Cypher."

9377, "The Cthulhu is down, the corvette has been eliminated, but there are still several cruisers out there. Keep it sharp people."

9382, "Damn, we've lost the Estennu."

9383, "The Khefrem has gone down! Repeat, the Khefrem has gone down!"

9384, "Dear God, I hope some of them made it to the escape pods."

9385, "Let's make sure her sacrifice was not in vain. I just hope that she's bought us enough time to do this."

9386, "We're out of range now, Alpha, get your people in and clear a path for the Argentus."

9387, "Aye aye, sir. Let's blow this bird, she's pissed me off one too many times."

9388, "Command, I'm getting a bad feeling about this. We're getting some subspace distortion here... she may be closer to activating the portal than we realized."

9389, "Are you sure, Cypher?"

9390, "Very sure, it's now a full blown surge. The gate will be arriving at any moment! Get the Argentus ready, we may have to do this hot! Alpha, get on those beams!"

9391, "That's it Command, the gate is arriving any second now. Tell the Argentus it's now or never."

9392, "Affirmative, Cypher. Alpha, do whatever you have to to eliminate those beams immediately!"

9393, "Whoah... Command, the Knossos has arrived. I'm reading a new corvette and two cruisers. She's starting to stabilize. "

9394, "It's going to be a lot worse if you don't take down those beams, Alpha. The Argentus is on its way, do it NOW!"

9395, "Argentus is in, Command. This is it, we're making our final run."

9396, "Godspeed Argentus, we will remember you."

9397, "Acknowledged. GTCv Argentus, signing off."

9398, "Alpha, get on those beams! The Argentus won't make impact without your help!"

9399, "That's one beam cannon down, two to go. "

9400, "Two down! We've almost got it."

9401, "YEAH! That's it! Command! We did it! The beams are down, repeat the beams are down! Argentus has a free path now!"

9402, "All remaining pilots, get clear of the blast!"

9403, "Yeeeeeeehaw! Take that you big ugly bastard! The Nyarlathotep has been destroyed, mission is successful! Repeat, the Nyarlathotep is an expanding cloud! Mission is successful!"

9404, "My God, what an explosion! "

9405, "Congratulations, everyone. We barely made that one. You will all receive a commendation for this one."

9406, "We damn well better, and I will duct tape it to my cockpit."

9407, "Understood, Mackie, see you back home. Return to base."

9408, "The Argentus is taking damage, pilot, at this rate, she will not make impact!"

9409, "The Argentus is losing her hull integrity. Alpha, you're running out of time!"

9410, "Dear God, no... The Argentus didn't make it... It was our last hope..."

9411, "What does this mean?"

9412, "It means unbuckle your belt, lean over and kiss your ass goodbye, kid. The Nyarlathotep is powering up her jump drive. It was nice knowing all of you, but I suspect we're all going to be dead in a few seconds."

9413, "Oh my God... Oh my God... We're done for..."
