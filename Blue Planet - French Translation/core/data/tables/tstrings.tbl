46, "Special Operations Command

You have volunteered for a covert assignment with $w Special $w Operations $w Command $w (SOC), in conjunction with $w Galactic $w Terran-Vasudan $w Intelligence $w (GTVI)$|. 

Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the $y GTVA$|."

47, "Your Assignment

Missions with the $w Special $w Operations $w Command are carried out deep in enemy territory, with minimal logistical support. Our behind-the-lines activities include infiltration, sabotage, surgical strikes, and intelligence gathering. 

You will be working undercover within the $h Neo-Terran $h Front, leading Alpha wing of the $w 185th fighter squadron."

48, "Lt. Commander Snipes

Your contact in this mission is $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Christopher $w Snipes, an allied officer who staged his defection to the $h NTF six months ago. As squadron leader of the $w 185th, $w Snipes will advise you of your mission objectives both as an $h NTF pilot and as an allied operative.

You will be equipped with a device that will enable you and $w Snipes to communicate over a secure frequency in battle. $h NTF ships will interpret your transmissions as targeting data."

49, "The ETAK Project

The focus of this covert operation is the $h NTF's $b ETAK project. Because access to information is restricted to the highest echelon, our knowledge here is limited. $b ETAK involves the development of a new, cutting-edge technology, possibly a weapon of mass destruction. 

$w Admiral $w Bosch oversees the project directly, and the rebels are constructing a prototype on the $h Iceni command ship. We need to get a closer look. Even a scan of the $h Iceni would be valuable."

50, "A Final Warning

We are working with the full cooperation of $f Vasudan $f Tactical $f Command and the $f Terran $f 6th $f Fleet$|. The probability that you will engage allied fighters will be minimal. However, should you come under allied attack, you have limited authorization to return fire in self-defense or to complete your mission objectives as defined by $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|. 

Show restraint, and use your judgement."

51, "This is $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|. For all you replacement pilots, welcome to the $w 185th$|. As you know, $w Admiral $w Koth's defeat in $b Epsilon $b Pegasi has opened the $b Polaris system to allied attack. At 1425 hours, $h GTVA expeditionary forces crossed our jump node blockade. The $h Colossus won't be far behind."

52, "$w Bosch isn't taking chances. We're moving the $f Iceni command ship to the $b Regulus system, where $w Bosch will install his provisional government. We've practiced this drill before, pilots. $f Alpha and $f Beta wing will escort the $f Iceni to the jump node. $f Delta, you're on standby."

53, "The $b Regulus node is located within a small asteroid field. Our job is to clear a path. Asteroids on a collision course with the $f Iceni will be indicated in white brackets on your HUD. That's how you know which asteroids to shoot. The gunners on the $f Iceni will help us out, so we shouldn't have too much trouble."

54, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is we got the Iceni and the Hinton to Regulus. The scan data you collected has been transmitted to the GTVI, and our operation to uncover the secret of ETAK continues as planned.

The bad news is we're in a lot more danger than I think you realize. The Vasudan warships were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our activities. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure has made the rebels just a little suspicious.

As usual, the GTVA is overplaying its hand. Ahmose and his subordinates now face a court martial for insubordination. The rebs are all over that one. Not only did the Admiral know the position of the Iceni, he wasn't authorized to act on that information. Our squadron will be high on the NTF's list of suspects. 

One more thing. The pilots under Ahmose's command had been informed of his renegade status before they launched their attack. Under these circumstances, we had little choice but to return fire or blow the entire operation.

Watch your back, pilot.  This ain't gonna get any easier. "

55, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is the Iceni has been destroyed along with Admiral Bosch and the ETAK project, whatever that was. 

The bad news is the allied warships that attacked the Iceni were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our operation. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure to Regulus has made the rebels just a little suspicious. Counterintel double-checked the dossiers of all new pilots and found some discrepancies in your file.

As your superior officer, it is my duty to inform you that you will be executed at 2100 hours for crimes of espionage and high treason. Sorry it had to end this way, pilot."

56, "You did not have authorization to return to base. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the NTF's objectives in this theatre. Unless Command decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Neo-Terran Front.

You will be confined to the brig pending your execution at 2100."

90, "As you have no doubt already heard, the $h GVD $h Psamtik has destroyed the $f NTD $f Cyrene, flagship of the $b Sirius fleet. As bad as things look in $b Polaris, the situation in $b Sirius is even worse. $w Bosch has redeployed our battle group to reinforce $f NTF positions in that system."

91, "We arrive in $b Sirius in six hours. The $w 185th will be deployed immediately to rendezvous with the $f NTT $f Sunder$|. Our mission will be to escort the transport back to the $b Regulus jump node. The cargo on board the $f Sunder has been classified well beyond my level of clearance. Let's just say if the $f Sunder goes down, so do we."

92, "The Alliance is fighting to secure the $b Alpha $b Centauri and $b Deneb jump nodes, so intelligence believes the risk of engagement will be low. Of course, that's what they told us in $b Polaris, where we got jumped by half the Vasudan armada. Expect the unexpected, kids, and report to the flight deck at 1310 sharp. Dismissed."

93, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The C.O. of the Sevrin has taken the brunt of Bosch's wrath for the Sunder's alleged destruction. The captain and his lieutenants have faced a summary court martial and will be executed at 0700. When you sign up for the wrong outfit, you get what you deserve.

This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. The rebs are nuts, but they're not slow. It won't take them long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence. If it looks like they're on to you, your duty as an operative of the GTVI is to escape and report everything you know to allied forces. Understood?"

94, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The destruction of the Hamaka forced our hand. The rebs are now fully aware that we're card-carrying members of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, we achieved the objectives of this covert operation. It wouldn't have taken the rebs long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence.

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. It's been an honor working with you, pilot. Good luck!"

95, "You may proceed to the next GTVI mission only if the Hamako and Sunder survive."

96, "With the destruction of the Sunder, our heist failed. With only our scan of the Iceni to go on, unraveling the secret of Bosch's ETAK project will be nearly impossible. We invested six months into this operation and came away empty-handed. 

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. Sorry your tour with the GTVI wasn't more successful, pilot. You had potential."

115, "Stand easy, pilots. We received a partial transmission reporting a reactor core breach. What happened to your squad?"

116, "We were ambushed by an allied heavy recon unit, flying some new kind of fighter. They splashed my squad and jumped before we could take them down."

124, "Of course, that's if they don't hang us for failing the mission. We might be pushing our luck here, but what the hell."

125, "This is the NTCv Sevrin, 2nd Battle Group, Regulus. What is your status, pilots? We were instructed to rendezvous with a transport."

126, "Sevrin, you're late! Vasudans blasted my entire squad and two cruisers out here! You want a rendezvous? Scan that debris field! That's the Sunder right there! You're a disgrace to the NTF, Sevrin! I'm filing a report!"

127, "Stand down, Beta 1. We followed our orders to the letter. Now get back to base before the Vasudans return. There's nothing more we can do out here."

128, "You see the Hamako? That's the new AWACS ship. We're using it to block all enemy transmissions. As long as that ship remains operational, no one on the outside will know what we're up to. As far as the NTF is concerned, we're still loyal and devoted rebel pilots."

129, "So watch the Hamako, all right? If we lose the AWACS, our cover's blown for good."

130, "Keep your eye on the ball, kids. We're almost there. But if that decoy doesn't get here real soon, we'll have to bail."

With the $h 13th and $h 11th $h Vasudan $h Battle $h Groups advancing, we have a hard fight ahead of us. If we lose $b Sirius, our backs will be against the wall. The $f NTF has fought too hard to surrender now."

141, "The $h 4th $h Fleet, based in $b Vega, is providing the Vasudans with logistical support. They've established a cargo depot near the $b Alpha $b Centauri jump node. Recon reports a perimeter defense of 16 sentry guns, and fighter patrols inspect the depot at regular intervals. The $w 185th has been called in to sever that supply line. All targets are of Terran construction."

142, "Our attack will be timed between fighter patrols. Our objective is to destroy all cargo and sentry guns. Once we secure the area, we'll be in a position to ambush allied targets. The attack should lure the enemy to the depot and improve our odds in more critical engagements deeper in the system."

143, "We are lucky to get you back alive, pilot. Our deep-cover operatives stashed vital schematic data in your fighter's on board computer. With this information, GTVI analysts will be able to unravel the enigma of Bosch's ETAK project. 

These operatives also advised us of your impending execution. Unfortunately, we have no information concerning the whereabouts or status of Lieutenant Commander Snipes. We fear the odds of his survival are not favorable.

In recognition of your outstanding service to the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence and Special Operations Command, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross. With this honor, you are now one of an elite few. 

We will bring you as far as Vega, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine and continue with your next squadron assignment. Congratulations on a successful tour with the GTVI."

144, "You willfully fired upon and destroyed a civilian transport. Allied Command has expressed its shock and dismay that an allied officer would indulge in the slaughter of innocent people. 

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae."

At 0437 reconnaissance units received a coded transmission from $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|.

The $f Grall was docked to the $h NTC $h Alexandria when the cruiser ran our blockade of the Knossos portal in $b Gamma $b Draconis$|."

Here is part of the actual transmission.  We processed the message to enable better comprehension:

Granite Mountain, this is Black Dove requesting immediate extraction.  Engines and jump drives are inoperative.  Location, Delta 429 by 372.  Deployed Pharos beacons to assist search.  Heavy Shivan presence. Severe nebula storms.  Probability of survival not good."

As you know, Allied forces are in full retreat to $b Gamma $b Draconis, so logistical support will be virtually non-existent. We have no available reinforcements and only one recovery ship. We're operating in a Shivan-infested area, so expect a fierce enemy offensive. The odds are against you on this one, pilot."

174, "You know why you're here, pilot, so let's get down to work. Recon located a $y Pharos navigation buoy not far from where $w Snipes's transmission was received. Your wing will be inserted at that position to find the $f Grall and make contact with $w Snipes$|. His transport has been incapacitated, and there's a high probability he's already a goner."

175, "This sector of the nebula is extremely volatile. Recon reports heavy EM interference, scrambling sensors and communications. These buoys are the only chance we have of finding $w Snipes and the $f Grall$|.

Now here's an important lesson. SOC didn't mount a rescue op because they liked me. They did it because I had information they needed, and information is what keeps you alive out here. Now I'm heading up the 99th for another mission, and I think we're going need you on this one. I already cleared it with Command, so it's your call, pilot. Hope you do the right thing."

His courage, resourcefulness, and determination helped us defeat Admiral Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front.

His career will stand as a shining example of service and sacrifice to the GTVA and the ideals for which the Alliance stands.

Meanwhile, $w SOC needs a unit to fly suicide to check out a second $y Knossos device the Vasudans found deep in the nebula."

214, "To give us a fighting chance, our unit will fly a wing of Shivan fighters $w SOC forces captured early in the nebula campaign. Our engineers have modified and optimized these craft. They'll handle even better than the Shivan original, and if you play it right, you might even avoid enemy detection. "

216, "The timetable for this mission is 15 minutes. We'll jump in, gather data, hold down the fort, then jump out. Your drives will be inoperative inside a window of exactly 15 seconds. If we miss our jump, the recovery ship will leave us behind. There's no room for error."

217, "Here's something else to think about. By the time we launch, we'll be the only allied operatives left in the nebula. There'll be no reinforcement, no support, and no base to run to. That's why this mission has to be carried out by the numbers. We have fifteen minutes. No more. No less."

218, "Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. GTVA analysts are now reviewing our flight data.

Unfortunately, we failed to destroy a single one of those Shivan devices. The Alliance demands top-notch flying from its elite squads, and our performance out there was a little disappointing. At least we were able to warn the Alliance.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

219, "It is possible to destroy the Shivan device that you discovered."

By the way, nice work destroying that Shivan technology. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

721, "The 107th patrols the nebula beyond the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis."

722, "Research Task Force

With the $b Gamma $b Draconis system secure, a task force of Terran and Vasudan scientists is now examining the subspace portal. At this point, the scientists have ruled out the possibility the device is of Shivan origin. 

$w Dr. $w Mina $w Hargrove, leader of the research team, has issued a report of its preliminary findings. An excerpt of this report follows."

723, "Dr. Hargrove, Task Force Preliminary Findings (Excerpt)

The subspace portal is unlike any Shivan construction we have yet encountered. Though Shivans demonstrate considerable diversity as a species, all Shivan technology possesses certain distinctive properties. None is present in the subspace device, which means we must look elsewhere for the portal's origin. We do know that the device is very, very old, on the order of several thousand years."

724, "Subspace Vortices

The field generated by the interlocking movement of the portal's components creates a subspace vortex, connecting one part of the universe to another.  $w Dr. $w Hargrove theorizes that whoever built this device may have used it to stabilize a jump node on the verge of collapse. 

If $w Dr. $w Hargrove is correct, this technology is a tremendous discovery."

725, "A Way Home?

By constructing our own portal, we might be able to reopen the $b Sol jump node in $b Delta $b Serpentis$|. Since the destruction of the $h Lucifer caused the node to collapse thirty-two years ago, $b Earth has remained isolated from the $y GTVA$|. 

We might also be able to stabilize subspace nodes that are currently too volatile for travel, thus creating routes to systems previously unexplored."

726, "Beyond the Portal

Our military operation will focus on what lies on the other side of the subspace portal. We must determine where the node leads and the extent of the Shivan presence there. Above all, we must prevent the Shivans from returning to $b Gamma $b Draconis$|. 

Because the portal will remain active while the research team studies the technology, our systems are vulnerable to attack.  Allied Command has deemed this an acceptable risk given the potential benefits."

727, "At 1540 hours, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered the subspace portal in $b Gamma $b Draconis and jumped to our current position. We have entered a nebula, a vast and dense ionized field, and possibly the remnant of a supernova. We have travelled farther than any Terrans in the history of subspace travel. "

728, "The nebula has severely limited the $f Aquitaine's long-range sensors. We are deploying our fighter wings to explore the immediate vicinity and determine the extent of the enemy presence. Each fighter squadron will deploy a flight of four wings. "

729, "$f Alpha, $f Zeta, $f Iota, and $f Kappa will patrol a series of four waypoints. $f Zeta wing will lead this sortie, so follow $f Zeta $f 1 and do not stray. Be advised the nebula could interfere with your on-board systems. The ionized field will compromise your sensors, even within combat range. "

730, "You confronted an overwhelming Shivan force in a hostile environment. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you or anyone else could have done to save the Trinity and our boarding party. You were lucky to survive this sortie, pilot. 

We have heard nothing from Kappa wing since they vanished from our sensors. Unfortunately, we must presume the worst. They will be listed MIA unless we find evidence to the contrary. Our search parties have found no trace of these fighters. 

The presence of the Trinity deepens the enigma of the NTF's secret agenda. What was the Trinity doing out here, and what does Bosch know about the subspace portal? 

All patrols have uncovered an extensive Shivan force in the nebula. Command will deploy more warships through the subspace portal to assist with our mission of exploration and containment.

Until we get these reinforcements, however, holding down the fort is all up to you. This sortie will be the first combat field test of the $y Perseus intercept fighter, so let's put on a good show."

902, "When you were selected for the 242nd Suicide Kings, you were singled out as a promising candidate for a command position. The officers who recommended you had faith in your potential to make an outstanding leader. Unfortunately, this assessment seems premature, at the very least.

I am disappointed in you, pilot. Though you probably fought well as an individual, you did not use your squadmates to the best advantage in this scenario. We lost Enif Station because you were placed in a situation you were ill-equipped to handle. That's not your fault. However, if you want to fly with a top-notch unit, you must learn the difference between doing an adequate job and going above and beyond the call of duty."

You and your wing also showed us what the Perseus intercept fighter can do. Against overwhelming odds, you repelled an attack against a facility of the utmost strategic importance for the Alliance. 

The commander of Enif Station personally extends his gratitude, pilot. I can see you'll make a fine addition to the Suicide Kings.

The Alliance has won battle after battle throughout the system, crushing the NTC Rapier, the NTC Explorer, and the NTD Normandy. These victories have stalled the rebel advance, and now with the help of the Colossus, we will push them back into the Polaris system, securing Epsilon Pegasi once and for all."

Be thankful, pilot, that we no longer live in an era in which an incident such as this could ignite an all-out war between our species. The GTVA is strong, and we have moved beyond the misunderstandings of the past. However, the destruction of an allied ship under our protection is an embarrassment to the squadron. That this happened under your leadership should give you pause. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

The $f Warspite will supervise this combined arms exercise."

1084, "The $w 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the $y Target $y Acquisition and $y Guidance missile. This will be the first deployment of this system in an actual combat exercise. Our laboratory simulations indicate it has significant potential as a tactical weapon. "

1085, "When you hit a target with the $y TAG warhead, the missile's beacon will illuminate the target for allied capital ships within range. All available firepower will be brought to bear for a quick resolution. This technology could be a decisive advantage for the $y GTVA$|. In this exercise, we will test the prototype $y TAG-A$|."

1086, "Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your $y TAG$|s. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness. The $f Lucidity will provide $y AWACS coverage.  "

The $y Ulysses is a $y Great $y War antique, but the fighter still handles well, and the modifications will enable $y TAG engineers to monitor the progress of the exercise. "

1089, "Though this exercise did not proceed as planned, the 134th met the challenge head-on and defended our warships admirably. 

Overall, this field deployment of the TAG missile exceeded our expectations. Research and Development is now working on improvements to the TAG-A prototype, including an aspect-seeking warhead and a more maneuverable projectile. These enhancements should make the TAG a versatile weapon for our tactical wings."

1090, "The destruction of the Warspite was a senseless tragedy. The lives of Captain Forsythe and his crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise. The 134th was called upon to get our warships out of a difficult situation, and we failed. As leader of Alpha wing, re-evaluate this scenario carefully. What could you have done to save the Warspite?"

1091, "You must make careful use of every TAG missile you are alotted.  Since they are unguided missiles you are advised to get as close to your target as possible.  Once an enemy is TAG'ed move clear quickly so you don't take friendly fire."

Because we serve on the front lines, the brass think it's our duty to take the fall for their mistakes. As your squadron leader, I will testify on your behalf. More wings should have been deployed to cover the Aquitaine's retreat. However, until Command completes its inquiry, you will be stripped of your wings and held in custody. You are dismissed, pilot."

At 0345 hours, the $f GTVA $f Colossus destroyed the Shivan juggernaut $h Sathanas near the $b Gamma $b Draconis jump node in $b Capella$|.

We now know that $w Admiral $w Bosch has developed a Shivan communication technology that transmits and modulates quantum pulses. $w Bosch secretly resurrected a defunct GTI project involving captured Shivan specimen, terminated after the GTI's $y Hades rebellion in 2335. $w Bosch referred to his project as $b ETAK, short for Etamnanki, the tower that may have inspired the story of Babel."

Through a rigorous study of $y Ancient archeology, $w Bosch learned the location of the $y Knossos subspace device, the portal to the region of the galaxy where the $y Ancients first encountered the Shivans.

You are now authorized to use the $y GTW-19 $y Circe$|. Derived from advanced EM weaponry, the $y Circe disrupts shield systems by directing a barrage of fluctuating EM harmonics on the target.

For this reason, the $y Circe is best paired with a weapon such as the $y Maxim or the $y Prometheus, which inflict heavy hull damage."

With over one hundred thousand casualties and more Shivans incoming, we have no hope of holding $b Capella$|. Our only real chance is to seal off the system and prevent the invasion from spreading to other Terran-Vasudan worlds. If we fail to contain the Shivan advance, we will unleash the second $y Great $y War, a conflict we have virtually no chance of surviving.

Over 80 Shivan Juggernauts are now in position around the $b Capella sun. Science vessels monitoring their activity have detected an anomalous subspace field rippling from the Juggernaut fleet.

Scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse, as evidenced by the destruction of the $h Lucifer 32 years ago.

However, scientists assure us this plan will work. Though Shivans have used uncharted nodes and nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels, they are as dependent on jump nodes as we are.

Welcome to the $w 107th $w Ravens, pilot. I'm $w Lieutenant $w Samsa, squadron leader.  As you know, the $f Aquitaine is now en route to the $b Gamma $b Draconis system. The details of the situation there have been classified at the highest level, so I'm as much in the dark as you are. The Admiral will brief the crew when we reach $f 3rd $f Fleet $f Headquarters in $b Capella$|."

2306, "The 107th Ravens

The $w 107th is a heavy assault squadron, so our fighter of choice is the $y Hercules $y Mark $y II$|. Implementing advances in fusion drive technology, the Mark II improves the assault fighter's speed and maneuverability without sacrificing loadout. The Herc has only two missile banks, but its ordnance capacity is greater than the Myrmidon's. The original Herc won the $y Great $y War, so we're proud to carry on the tradition."

2307, "The Hercules Mark II

I recommend that you review the Herc II training modules before the $f Aquitaine arrives in $b Capella$|. These modules review advanced tactics, such as countermeasures and energy management. The Herc II is slower than the $y Myrmidon you've been flying with the $w 53rd, so learn how to evade missiles and equalize shields. These skills will help you push your fighter to the limits. Master them, and the life you save may be your own."

2308, "New Weapons

According to your file, you are now authorized to use the $y GTW-5a $y Prometheus $y R, the $y GTM-19 $y Harpoon, and the $y GTM-4 $y Hornet missile. 

The $y Prometheus $y R is a retrofit of a cannon developed during the $y Great $y War$|. After the Alliance lost contact with $b Earth, we lacked materials required for mass production, so engineers developed this retrofit version. The $y Prometheus packs a bigger wallop than the $y Subach $y HL-7, but it will drain your power reserves with extended use."

2309, "New Weapons

The $y Harpoon and the $y Hornet are both aspect-seeking missiles. While the $y Harpoon fires individual warheads, the $y Hornet launches a swarm of four projectiles, eight if you're in double-fire mode. The training modules cover the proper technique for firing aspect-seeking missiles, so be sure to review that section carefully. That's all for now, pilot. The $f Aquitaine will arrive in $b Capella in four hours."

2340, "Well done, pilot! Let's try this again."

2341, "Order Epsilon wing to destroy Transport 02. Do you remember your previous instruction?  If not, consult the directives list."

2342, "Good work. Be aware that fighter wings are less effective against larger targets. Bombers or vessels with beam turrets are usually required to destroy warships larger than cruiser class."

2343, "Also note that reinforcements are not always available, and you will have authorization to issue orders only to specific wings and ships."

2344, "Now let's order Epsilon wing to depart."

2345, "Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

2346, "Excellent work. As you gain experience in combat, using the communications interface will become second nature."

2347, "All right, pilot. Now it's time to learn about countermeasures."

2348, "When you launch a countermeasure, you present a new target for pursuing missiles. In theory, the missiles should hit the countermeasure instead of ripping a hole through your hull."

2349, "You need to use countermeasures to survive in battle, but you'll soon learn this tactic does not always work."

2353, "A yellow triangle will appear on your HUD, indicating the vector of the missile's approach. Try to keep this indicator in the 3 or 9 o'clock position."

2354, "When the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile. The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

2355, "While launching countermeasures, turn your fighter hard in sharp movements. This will also help throw the missile off your trail."

2356, "If you evade the missile, an indicator will display in the upper portion of your targeting reticle. This will alert you to the fact that you successfully avoided the projectile."

2357, "The number of countermeasures remaining is indicated on your HUD below the weapons display. If you run out of countermeasures, call in the support ship to reload."

2358, "You've sustained heavy damage from those missiles, pilot. You are advised to review TSM-107m. Your chances of survival will be minimal if you cannot use countermeasures effectively."

2359, "That's enough for evading missiles. Now let's practice firing them."

2360, "Your Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter is armed with two banks of Harpoons."

2361, "Unlike heat-seekers like the Rockeye, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

2362, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth the effort because its homing ability is much stronger."

2363, "If a heat seeker loses track of its target, chances are it will not reacquire lock. Aspect seekers, on the other hand, will track their targets until they detonate."

2364, "Transport 03 is now entering.  Let's take this opportunity to learn another targeting control."

2365, "You have a reticle targeting control [$y$] that will acquire the nearest object inside your reticle. Maneuver your fighter so that my ship is centered on your HUD."

2366, "Good. Now use the reticle targeting control [$y$] to target my fighter."

2367, "Well done. Now target Transport 03 using the reticle targeting control. [$y$] Make sure the transport is in the center of your HUD."

2368, "Excellent. Now let's see how you do with those Harpoons."

2369, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Triangle.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This means your Harpoons are locked and ready to fire."

2370, "Now fire one Harpoon at the freighter."

2371, "Note how fast the Harpoon moves.  This warhead delivers quite a punch."

2372, "A round of Harpoons can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

2373, "The Harpoon is almost useless if fired before lock has been acquired. That's a major distinction between the Harpoon and the Rockeye."

2374, "Now unload your Harpoons until you've destroyed Transport 03."

2375, "Excellent job.  Let's see how you do against moving targets."

2376, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed position inside your HUD reticle."

2377, "We'll now bring in the fighter drones. When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock. Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

2378, "Once you have acquired lock, fire a Harpoon to destroy the drone.  These drones will not be using countermeasures."

2379, "Well done.  All aspect seekers function this way, from the Hornet missile to the Helios torpedo. In general, the larger and more powerful the warhead, the longer it will take to acquire lock and countdown between volleys."

2380, "Now let's have you face a real challenge.  Multiple wings will appear simultaneously.  Destroy them all."

2405, "The Alliance acquired shielding technology from the Shivans during the Great War. Shield systems have been standard on Terran-Vasudan fighters and bombers for over thirty years."

2406, "Your shield system generates an energy shell that protects the hull of your ship from primary fire and missile blasts."

2407, "As they absorb damage, your shields will weaken. However, your fighter will automatically regenerate its shields over time."

2408, "Your shield integrity gauge is located in the lower right of your HUD.  This gauge is now flashing."

2426, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

2427, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can deflect the gunfire of your pursuer."

2429, "We will conclude this module with an overview of your energy transfer system, or ETS."

2430, "You can use your ETS controls to augment or diminish the energy allocated to each of these three systems."

2431, "First, let's increase your weapons energy allocation. [Press $insert$ four times.] Observe that as you divert power to weapons, the energy levels for shields and engines drop."

2432, "The more energy diverted to weapons, the faster your primaries will recharge. Your weapons will not inflict greater damage at higher ETS levels."

2433, "High-energy cannons, such as the Prometheus, can quickly deplete your weapon reserves. If you require a sustained barrage of gunfire, diverting energy to primaries may be necessary."

2434, "Now let's increase your shield allocation. [Press $home$ three times.]"

2435, "The higher your ETS setting for shields, the faster they'll recharge. Increasing your shield allocation may be critical in combat situations, such as stopping to rearm your fighter or flying through heavy flak."

2436, "Now divert more power to your engines. [Press $page up$ twice.]"

2437, "Increasing power to engines will improve your maximum speed by up to 30%, depending on the fighter's reactor capacity. Your afterburners will also recharge faster, enabling more frequent bursts of speed."

2473, "As the Seraphim bombers approach the Deimos, they launch their ordnance."

2474, "Use the bomb targeting control [$b$] to acquire the Shivan warheads. If there are no warheads in flight, this control will select the nearest bomber."

2475, "The bomb will appear in your Target View until it detonates. Observe that as the bomb impacts the hull of the Deimos, the name of the corvette flashes in your escort monitor. That's how you know a ship on your escort list is taking damage."

2476, "Bombs also appear as amber blips on your radar."

2477, "Let's cover one more targeting control. The Target's Attacker function [$g$] enables you to select the enemy ship attacking your target. This is especially useful in defensive or escort missions."

2478, "First, select the vessel you have been ordered to defend. Cycle through friendly targets [$f$] or use the escort targeting control. [$e$]"

2479, "Very good. Now use the target's attacker control [$g$] to acquire the nearest hostile currently attacking your target. That would be the Seraphim."

2480, "Now let's see how well you do in a combat situation. To make things fair, we'll restore the Deimos to full strength."

2481, "Before we unleash the bombers, here are a few more pointers."

2482, "First, locate the bomb by sensors or by sight. You'll destroy the bombs more efficiently if you can rely on visual contact, but sometimes you'll need to use the bomb targeting control if you get disoriented. [$b$]"

2483, "It only takes one or two hits to destroy a bomb, and most warheads are generally slower than your intercept fighter. But don't get too close. The shockwave could damage your hull or knock out your subsystems."

2484, "Obviously, the best tactic is to destroy the bombers before they launch their ordnance. An intercept fighter is built for speed so that you can engage multiple bomber waves across the field of engagement."

2485, "You lost the Deimos, pilot. It's a challenge but not impossible. We'll abort the simulation now so you can start over and try again."

2486, "Excellent work, pilot. You repelled the bomber attack and protected the Deimos."

2487, "Here's another tip. Using the messaging window, you can order your squadmates to protect a target. Pilots assigned to protect a target will help you intercept bombs launched at the target. Chasing bombs is a lot easier when you work together as a team."

2488, "You have depleted your missile banks, pilot. Call in the support ship to rearm. [$Shift-R$]"

2491, "Good. As a fighter, you have minimal chance of destroying a large ship on your own. Bombs and beam cannons are much more effective, but these weapons are too big to mount on a fighter."

2492, "However, the speed and maneuverability of the fighter make it ideal for surgical strikes against the turrets and subsystems of larger ships."

2493, "Use the turret targeting control [$k$] to cycle through the turrets of the ship. Observe that the corvette has a range of weapon types, including beam weapons, laser cannons, flak guns, and missile launchers. I'm sure you're well acquainted with all of these by now."

2494, "Observe how the turret is outlined by a large square. The Target View will display the type of turret and its current integrity.  If the targeted object is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2495, "Now target the missile launchers on the Deimos and destroy them."

2496, "Excellent. Once you destroy a turret, your sensors will automatically target the next turret in order of priority."

2497, "Larger warships have dozens of firing points, and in combat situations, you might not have time to cycle through all the turrets to find the one that is firing at you."

2498, "You have an attacker targeting control [$r$] that will select the nearest hostile firing on your ship. If the attacker is a warship, the turret firing on you will be targeted."

2499, "This control can help you prioritize the enemies that pose the greatest danger to your fighter."

2504, "Great work, pilot."

2505, "Looks like you've had enough. In the field of battle, approach a warship with the utmost caution. With a fast and light ship like the Perseus, stay on the move at all times. Destroy the turret in two or three strafing runs if you have to."

2506, "Let's end this session with a look at targeting subsystems."

2507, "By pressing the subsystem targeting control [$s$] repeatedly, you can cycle through the subsystems of your target."

By maximizing shielding and payload (while offering enough maneuverability to make it a viable tactical unit), the Boanerges promises to remain in service for decades to come. One test pilot observed that the Boanerges handles better than any other bomber and has enough firepower to make it a formidable anti-capship weapon."

The Model IV is every fighter pilot's first TSM opponent, the first mobile foe he faces during simulator courses. If you can't handle an Amazon during training, it's time to reconsider your choice of careers."

3036, "The GTDr Amazon Advanced Model VII was an unmanned combat drone used for advanced flight combat training. It was larger, smarter, and more heavily armored than the basic Amazon drone. As with the basic Amazon, these are now encountered only in the virtual battlefields of the TSM training module series. The Model VII is used to simulate assaults on enemy capital ships, training fighter and bomber pilots to target turrets and ship subsystems. Command has found that virtual training against Model VIIs increases the survival rate of pilots by 37% when attacking capital ships."

3037, "The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Triton Dynamics designed the Hygeia class with huge cargo bays for munitions storage, plus the latest magnetic-stasis delivery system for quickly re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3038, "The GTFr Triton hauls almost twice the tonnage of the Poseidon-class freighters that have served the Alliance since the Great War. The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTVA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

3039, "TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTVA reuses the containers in many capacities."

3040, "The GTFr Poseidon is the smaller of the two standard Terran military freighters. Though it carries only half as much cargo as the Triton, the Poseidon is more often chosen for dangerous missions. Its greater speed gives it better survivability on the front lines, as does the fact that it has four weapon turrets, compared to the Triton's two. When Allied Command sends supplies and munitions that have to get through, a Poseidon is usually chosen to transport them."

3041, "
The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTVA for deep space cargo transport. Its thin hull will preserve Terran-standard atmospheric conditions inside, as long as the hull seal has not been comprised by weapon fire or collision. TC 2 containers are cheap to manufacture and heavily used everywhere but the front lines (where the armored TAC 1 containers are employed, when available)."

3042, "
The TSC 2 container is armored, providing more protection for its cargo than does the TC 2. This armor serves mainly to protect against hull breaches due to collisions, as it's not thick enough to provide much protection against enemy attacks. TSC 2s are used in busy supply depots in which collision damage is a hazard."

3043, "The TAC 1 is a very heavily armored type of Terran cargo container. It is most often used to hold delicate or valuable cargoes. TAC 1s are generally found in front-line operations in which protection from enemy attacks is a primary consideration."

3044, "The TTC 1 is a civilian cargo container modified for military use. It is a dense-hulled container originally designed to protect fragile technical and scientific equipment. The same protection is now used to guard against collision and attack damage to replacement ship subsystems and other electronic equipment intended for combat spacecraft."

3045, "The GTC Fenris class is the aging stalwart among the Alliance's warships. Before the Great War, the Fenris was Terran Command's only class of cruisers. During the war, Terran Command decided to build a second line of cruisers, the Leviathans, to free the Fenris from escort and guard duties. Fenris cruisers have fought in virtually every theatre of operation. These fast, versatile cruisers pack enough punch in their 260-meter-long hulls to go toe-to-toe with any enemy cruiser. The Fenris's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for strike missions."

3046, "Terrans developed the GTM Hippocrates early in the post-war Reconstruction period. With the outbreak of the NTF insurgency, the GTVA has once again called the Hippocrates into active military service. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Allied-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach."

3047, "Early in the Great War, Han-Ronald engineers designed and built the Leviathan class of cruisers. The Leviathan is much heavier armed and armored than the Fenris, but also much slower and less maneuverable. Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations, where firepower is king and speed is of little importance. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. The Fenris is good for fast-moving operations, but when you need some muscle, call in a Leviathan."

3048, "The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines."

3049, "When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTVA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTVA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

3050, "Ships of the GTA Charybdis class have been packed with the latest tachyon-enabled AWACS equipment from GTVI labs. Each GTVA battle group has a squadron of Charybdis-class ships assigned to it. These ships double the range of the group's standard detection arrays. Charybdis ships' thin armor and weak defenses make them easy victims for enemy bombers. They have proven indispensable, however, in forays into the nebula beyond the Knossos portal. Charybdis-class ships are very vulnerable in this environment, as witnessed by the recent loss of the GTA Panopticon from the 3rd Battle Group."

3051, "For over 30 years, the GTD Orion class was the largest ship in the Terran-Vasudan armada. Over two kilometers in length, bristling with dozens of death-dealing turrets, the Orion is as awesome in repose as it is in battle. All GVTA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers. The Orion's cavernous hanger bays easily accommodate more than two dozen fighter or bomber wings."

3052, "The new GTD Hecate class of destroyers is replacing the Orion class as the flagship of Terran battle groups. More heavily armed than the Orion, the Hecate also carries over 150 combat spacecraft and a crew of 10,000. The GTD Aquitaine is a superb example of this new ship class, serving as the flagship of the Capella-based 3rd Fleet."

3053, "The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources."

3054, "The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

3055, "The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups."

3056, "Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet."

3057, "The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however."

3058, "The Iceni is the NTF command frigate, built under Admiral Bosch's direction at the Freedom shipyards in Polaris, captured by the Neo-Terran Front at the start of their rebellion.  With over two dozen turrets and a sheath of ultra-dense depleted uranium shielding around its subsystems, the Iceni is an extremely tough nut to crack. With Bosch on board, providing tactical guidance, the Iceni is the equal of any GTVA battle group. Intelligence believes the ship was custom-designed for a secret NTF project."

3059, "Hidden NTF asteroid base."

3060, "The GTT Elysium class of transports has been in service for over 40 years. Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class."

3061, "The GTT Argo has become the standard military transport vehicle for the Terran fleet. Argos sometimes carry new weapon and combat craft prototypes to and from testing grounds or to front-line deployment positions. Military VIPs occasionally commandeer Argos to travel from star system to star system in some semblance of comfort. Argos are most often used as assault transports, carrying squads of Marines through heavy flak to board enemy vessels that Command has decided to capture rather than destroy."

3062, "The GTI Ganymede is the Alliance's newest repair and resupply facility. Ganymede installations are currently deployed behind the front lines in the Vega, Vasuda, and Capella systems. Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTVA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

3063, "The subspace portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system in 2367. The interlocking circular motions of its components apparently create a subspace vortex that connects the Gamma Draconis system to another part of our universe.  Dr. Hargrove's team continues to study the device, though their findings are highly classified."

3064, "The GTSG Watchdog was the first generation of Terran sentry platform, the distant precursor to the Cerberus and Alastor platforms. Seriously underpowered by today's standards, the Watchdog also suffers from paper-thin armor. Many Watchdogs are Great War relics left active and in place because it wasn't worthwhile removing or deactivating them. The NTF occasionally uses stolen Watchdogs to guard supply depots or minor installations."

3065, "Until the advent of the GTSG Alastor, the GTSG Cerberus was the most advanced sentry gun emplacement available to Terran forces. They were vital to Terran defenses during the Great War, racking up over 100 kills of Vasudan and Shivan combat craft. But the current conflict has found them primarily in back-line roles, guarding installations deemed relatively safe from attack. With no mobility and only two Subach HL-7 turrets, they serve as more of a distraction than a viable threat to modern combat craft."

3066, "GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. Two Bessmer-Kohn cannon turrets on opposing sides of the platform give the Alastor a full field of fire. The turrets are controlled by the latest neural-net cyber-AI to track multiple targets simultaneously."

3067, "The GTEP Hermes escape pod is now standard equipment on every GTVA warship of cruiser size or larger. Each ship has several escape pods magnetically coupled to airlocks scattered around the ship's outer hull. Not intended for whole-crew evacuations, the Hermes has space for up to 20 crew members. Each pod is propelled by a small fusion engine, enough to remove the pod from the immediate vicinity of an exploding warship. It is also capable of subspace jumps."

3104, "The GVB Sekhmet is a Shivan design that was initially adapted to Vasudan needs by Hammer of Light engineers. The version currently in use was further modified by technicians at Mekhu Enterprises. Sporting four primary weapon banks and three missile/bomb bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch. Add in a top speed that surpasses that of some fighters and an ultra-dense molybdenum armor plating, and it's easy to see why the Sekhmet is the favorite bomber among Vasudan pilots."

Osiris bombers still in service have been retrofitted to make them compatible with most GTVA missiles and bombs.

3116, "Learning a lesson from the bomber losses of the Great War, Vasudan defense contractor Akheton designed the GVB Bakha, a fast, agile bomber that could still deliver a warship-shattering payload. The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime."

3122, "The stealth prototype GVF Ptah was a top-secret development project assigned to Vasudan conglomerate Akheton Corp. Designed to be invisible to standard detection arrays mounted on combat craft, Ptahs have performed admirably during their OpEval period. The masking materials and blending technologies used across their outer surfaces seem to confuse Shivan detection systems as well. The Ptah is currently available only to select fighter units in the Vasudan navy, with no word on when they will be more widely distributed."

3123, "The GVS Nephtys is the Vasudans' new support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The high number of warheads carried by the Nephtys makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3124, "The GVT Isis is most often used as a military personnel transport but also occasionally serves as a repair ship or even a tugboat, helping to maneuver large vessels into docking bays. Two cannon turrets and thick molybdenum plating serve to protect its cargo. Magnetic cargo locks located on the Isis's undercarriage enable it to transport small cargo containers of supplies and munitions in emergencies."

3125, "The Ma'at freighter class has served the Vasudan navy for over 50 years. More than 200 of these vessels still serve the GTVA, carrying desperately needed supplies, foodstuffs, and munitions to every theatre of the war. With only three weapon turrets, a lone Ma'at is easy prey for a wing of enemy bombers. Thus Ma'ats usually travel in mixed convoys with other freighters, guarded by cruisers and fighter wings."

3126, "For the past 20 years, the GVFr Bes has been the mainstay of Vasudan shipping fleets. While some Terran systems languished in the post-war era, the Vasudans experienced an economic recovery that was miraculous, given the annihilation of their home planet. Experts credit the policies of the restored Imperial government that emerged following Khonsu II's dissolution of the Vasudan parliament. As commerce among the Vasudan systems resumed and expanded into Terran worlds, a new generation of space-faring cargo vessels was required to meet the needs of this burgeoning economy."

3127, "The Vasudan VAC 5 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3128, "The Vasudan VAC 4 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3129, "When the first Satis-class freighter was encountered by Terran forces during the Terran-Vasudan War, its firepower led Terran Command to classify it as a light cruiser. Only after a disabled Satis was captured did its true nature become known. Now designated the GVFr Satis class, these freighters still serve as an iron fist within the velvet glove of a freighter convoy. Few enemy fighters who mistake a Satis for a Ma'at or Bes live to regret their error."

3130, "The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet."

3131, "The GVC Aten is among the smallest of the GTVA's cruiser classes, with thin armor and only a few, relatively weak turrets. Terran fighters and bombers exploited these weaknesses during the early years of the Great War, when the Terrans and Vasudans were still enemies. The Aten is most often seen in the current conflict as a rear-guard defense for convoys or installations, backing up wings of fighters and bombers."

3132, "The GVC Mentu cruiser is the lightest of the new Vasudan warships. Following the Great War, allied scientists developed the beam cannons that now serve as the primary armaments of today's GTVA warships. Rather than modify existing ships, the Vasudans developed new designs to mount these weapons. The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi."

3133, "Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves."

3134, "The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice."

3135, "The GVSG Ankh sentry gun platform is the Vasudan equivalent of the GTSG Watchdog. Both are Great War relics that perform poorly by modern standards. The Ankh serves to guard back-line storage depots and installations. With no armor or shielding, the Ankh is easily destroyed. Its two small turrets can deter unarmed raiders or badly damaged fighters, but it poses little threat to most combat craft."

3136, "When the GTVA asked the Vasudan navy to upgrade the Great War-era Ankh sentry gun platform, the GVSG Edjo was the Vasudans' answer. The Edjo has significantly more armor plating than the Ankh, improving its survivability, but the Vasudans placed only one small cannon turret on the new platform, giving it half the punch of the Ankh. After seeing the Edjo, the Terrans quietly began developing their own advanced sentry gun platforms. The Vasudan navy seems content to leave this aspect of military technology to the Terrans."

3137, "The GVEP Ra escape pod has been the standard emergency vehicle on Vasudan capital ships since the Terran-Vasudan War. In keeping with Vasudan philosophies, the Ra is almost never used to evacuate personnel, but instead is employed to preserve records and other data that could be of use to the allies. Thus Ra-class craft have minimal life support systems and a small fusion engine. The energy supplied by the escape pod's powerplant goes almost entirely to powering the pod's homing beacon."

3138, "The GVA Setekh is the Vasudan class of AWACS vessels, comparable to the Terran GTA Charybdis class. Setekhs are smaller, less heavily armored, and have half the turrets of Charybdis ships. Despite these shortcomings, the Vasudan navy insists upon deploying Setekhs in Vasudan battle groups, claiming the Vasudan versions are more appropriate for their fleets. Setekhs' crystalline detection arrays provide their fleets with doubled radar range within the nebular region. Every Vasudan battle group operating in this theatre has a wing of Setekhs attached to it."

3139, "In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet."

3140, "The Shivan fighter class SF Dragon is a fast, extremely agile craft. Its twin lasers pack a deadly punch. The Dragon's weakness seems to be a thin hull. The trouble is that their speed and maneuverability make them extremely difficult to hit."

3141, "The SF Basilisk is a Shivan heavy attack fighter. Slow but heavily armed and well-protected, the Basilisk targets slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3142, "The Manticore fighter is the fastest known craft in the Shivan armada. With a single, powerful laser and two missile banks, it is a dangerous offensive weapon. Its Achilles' heel lies in its thin hull and weak shields. Manticores do not last long in dogfights against other fighters. They prefer to target bombers, which are nearly helpless against the Manticore's speed and weaponry."

3143, "The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3144, "The SF Mara class of Shivan fighters was first encountered by the GTC Vigilant while patrolling the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. All other information concerning the Mara is classified level Psi."

3145, "First encountered in Gamma Draconis, the SF Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly."

3146, "The SB Nephilim is the slowest of the Shivan bomber classes. These craft were first encountered during the Great War and are still found in many Shivan attack formations. Nephilims are heavily armored and shielded, enabling them to deliver their devastating payloads despite their lack of speed."

3147, "The SB Taurvi is a Shivan vessel that has only recently been encountered. The Taurvi is one of the weaker Shivan bomber classes, but still the equal of every bomber in the GTVA arsenal. Not as maneuverable as a Nahema, nor as tough as a Seraphim or Nephilim, the Taurvi appears to be a Shivan compromise between speed and power."

3148, "Either the SB Nahema class is a new Shivan bomber design, or the Shivans are finally taking the GTVA seriously and bringing in their best ships. The Nahema is considered to be the Shivan's most dangerous bomber. It has demonstrated the ability to outrun virtually every fighter in the GTVA fleet. Its powerful laser banks and high-capacity missile bays make it a threat to combat craft of all types, as well as to capital ships."

3149, "The SB Seraphim is a familiar foe to GTVA forces. They appear to be similar to Nephilims in speed, armor, and shield strength, but have demonstrated a larger bomb capacity."

3150, "Encountered on rare occasions since the Shivans first entered the Great War, the ST Azrael is the only known class of Shivan transport. Little is known about it even now, but it is believed to house many Shivans within its thin hulls. Since Azraels might be carrying Shivan pilots or other skilled crew members, it is always worthwhile to eliminate these lightly defended ships."

3151, "The SFr Dis class of freighters is smaller than the Asmodeus class and not as well armed. It is still much more dangerous to attack than the GTVA's Triton or Poseidon freighters, however."

3152, "The SAC 3 is the most common Shivan cargo container found thus far. Its thin plating is barely enough to maintain the interior atmospheric integrity against the vacuum of space. As no additional effort was made to armor these containers against attack, it is assumed that only items of low value or importance are carried within. Nevertheless, standing orders are to capture these containers at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3153, "The SFr Mephisto class is equivalent to the Dis class in size and combat capabilities. Given their wildly different configurations, they must serve different purposes for the Shivans, but Allied Intelligence currently offers no further information on this matter."

3154, "The SC 5 class of Shivan cargo container is functionally identical to the SAC 3 class, as far as GTVA engineers have been able to determine. As with all Shivan cargo containers, standing orders are to capture at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3155, "Little is known about the SFr Asmodeus line of freighters. With a strong hull and four weapon turrets, they are the most dangerous Shivan freighters to attack. Nothing is known of the cargo Asmodeus freighters commonly carry."

3156, "The SAC 2 is a heavily armored variant of the standard Shivan cargo container. Equipment found in captured SAC 2s appears to be more fragile than that found in the more common SAC 3s. SAC 2 cargo containers are to be captured rather than destroyed at every opportunity. If the choice is between destruction and allowing the container to be recovered by Shivan forces, pilots are authorized to destroy the container."

3157, "The SC Lilith class of Shivan cruisers is a far-deadlier foe than the Cain class. Nearly impenetrable armor plating enables it to withstand tremendous punishment, enabling its nine turrets to lash out at warships and combat spacecraft with impunity."

3158, "Though not as thickly armored as the Lilith class, the SC Rakshasa class of Shivan cruisers is far deadlier. With over a dozen turrets, the Rakshasa is the most heavily armed Shivan cruiser class. It was a Rakshasa cruiser that destroyed the GTC Vigilant at the Gamma Draconis node in the Capella system."

3159, "The weakest of the Shivan cruiser classes is designated SC Cain. These vessels were commonly encountered during Great War battles. Cains are considered to be slightly stronger than the GTC Fenris cruiser class."

3160, "The SD Demon class of Shivan destroyers is much smaller than the Lucifer class but very heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Demons are known to carry numerous wings of fighters and bombers."

3161, "The SD Ravana is a destroyer class GTVA forces have only recently encountered. It appears to be tasked with clearing out smaller foes, a mission for which it is well suited. It eagerly wipes out wings of fighters and bombers and also overwhelms cruisers and corvettes."

3162, "The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion."

3163, "The SSG Trident line of sentry gun platforms is well known from numerous encounters during the Great War. These are still used to guard Shivan installations, but many of the stronger Belial platforms have been deployed to the most critical defensive positions."

3164, "The SSG Belial sentry gun platform appears to be a radical redesign of the Trident platform that was first encountered during the Great War. Pilots who have encountered both report that the Belial is harder to kill. It is reliably known that the Belial has twice as many laser turrets as the Trident sentry gun. Both types are used to guard storage depots, gas miners, and other Shivan installations."

3165, "Almost nothing is known of the Rahu line of gas miners. It is assumed that they function in much the same way as our Zephyrus miners, funneling nebular gas into internal machinery that fractionates it into its molecular components for further processing. Rahu miners are armed with heavy laser turrets, so care must be taken when attacking them."

3166, "Only one class of Shivan ship is classified as a corvette - the SCv Moloch class. Though they're physically as large as the GTCv Deimos class, Molochs do not seem to pack the same punch. They are far more deadly than any Shivan cruisers, however."

3167, "Very little is known about the SJ Sathanas class. This juggernaut seems comparable in strength to the GTVA Colossus.  All intelligence concerning the Sathanas has been classified level Upsilon."
