  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.  Remember pilots, our victory does not diminish the danger of Shivan fighters.  Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.  Although there has been some minority Vasudan resistance regarding the continuance of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, for the most part, our two species have formed a solid partnership."

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''  While most of these factions are insignificant, GTA Command believes that one group, Humans Against Reckless Colonization (HARC) has placed several anonymous GTA officers on its payroll.

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies and defense for our frontier colonization efforts is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

5468, "EMAIL
To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5469, "Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

5478, "If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

5479, "Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

5480, "Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

5486, "Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5487, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5488, "The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

The Vasudan fleet is mobilizing in Manda to begin colonization of Mandala Prime.  Colonization will begin tomorrow at 0700 hours."

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communication station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus.  The outpost has been shut down and all transmission from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destiny."

5670, "As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a ''virus outbreak''.  We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command.  A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

5672, "The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters.  Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

5674, "Our long range scans indicate that a their is some sort remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar.  Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell.  Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

5675, "I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

Protect the Destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

Terran intelligence believes he is planning to give this information to the $h Hammer $h of $h Light. Vasudan intelligence has confirmed this belief.

6005, "After the transport carrying Bowman is disabled, concentrate on disabling the other two transports without destroying them.."

6006, "Allowing the Hammer of Light officials to escape shows poor judgement on your part, pilot. Our relations with the Vasudans were strained enough as it was, and now that you failed in this part of the mission, matters are even worse. Let's just hope our diplomats can smooth things over."

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

Fortunatly due to your efforts the Elysium was not lost in vein. With the destruction of the Death Storm the Shivan attacks in this area appear to have dropped to almost non existant levels. Well Done."

With the destuction of the the GTD Prometheus, the Shivan threat in this area appears to be on the increase. The loss of the Prometheus will be greatly mourned.
