The Vasudan ambassador has alerted us that the Vasudan Empire has chosen a new homeworld, Mandala Prime in the Manda system.

5962, "Because high tension still exists between our species, we must make the Manhattan's destruction look like an accident.

5972, "The operation went smoothly.  The demolitions team was able to plant their special charge.  Long range scans show a perfect internal explosion.  Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.  GTA command believes that the removal of the cargo was undetected."

5973, "Extra congratulations to you for bringing your team back in one piece."

5974, "You failed to destroy all of the Manhattan's fighters.  This is pathetic work Alpha 1."

5975, "Unfortunately, you weren't able to perform a scan of the Manhattan cargo.  Fortunately, it was only schematics...however, had the freighter entered subspace with an unstable warhead...many lives would have been lost."

5976, "After the Manhattan blows, scan the area for cargo.  Once you find it, close to 150 meters and scan quickly."

5977, "Sadly, alpha wing is smaller upon return.  As the possibility of war with the Vasudans grows stronger, it becomes even more imperative to protect your wingmen."

5978, "Keep an eye on damaged wingmen and send them home if necessary.  Also, make sure to keep your wing far away from the Cruiser blast."

The $f GTSC $f Barnett, a Faustus class science vessel has made an important discovery about the Shivans. She is now returning to Terran space with an escort of two cruisers, the $f GTC $f Nimitz and the $f GTC $f Galron."

6217, "News from the Vasudans:

''Today a patrol of Horus class fighters on patrol was attacked.  We do not know who the attackers were and all the sole surviving pilot was able to say before he lost consciousness was 'Today, I did not know who was the enemy....'.  Beware, Terran allies, for it seems the Shivans have a new weapon.''"

Luckily, the $f Barnett was carrying information which will help prevent this weapon from affecting us again. Good job, pilot!"

6242, "You have destroyed the unknown ship.  By doing so you have denied the Shivans the use of this weapon and bought us time to analyze the information on the $f Barnett."

6945, "We don't expect any resistance as this area of space is rarely used. However you should keep on your toes though pilot. Good Luck."

6946, "You have failed to protect the transports during thier meeting. Thanks to you, not only did we loose the tactical data, but over 20 of the Vasudens best enginerring technicians lost their lives."

6947, "Protect the transports at all costs."

6948, "We've just recieved a communication from the Vasuden High Council. They have reported that the captain of the Isis was a member of the Hammer of Light. 

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

Fortunatly due to your efforts the Elysium was not lost in vein. With the destruction of the Death Storm the Shivan attacks in this area appear to have dropped to almost non existant levels. Well Done."

6949, "Congratulations Pilot. Your performance during this mission was amazing."

6950, "We've just recieved a communication from the Vasuden High Command. They have reported that the captain of the Isis was a member of the Hammer of Light. 

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

With the destuction of the the GTD Prometheus, the Shivan threat in this area appears to be on the increase. The loss of the Prometheus will be greatly mourned.

Dismissed."
