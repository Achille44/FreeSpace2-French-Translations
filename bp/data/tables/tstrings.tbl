44, "(fr)Rebels & Renegades"

45, "(fr)Snipes and Alpha 1 must scan the Iceni as they escort the rebel command ship to Regulus."

46, "(fr)Special Operations Command

You have volunteered for a covert assignment with $w Special $w Operations $w Command $w (SOC), in conjunction with $w Galactic $w Terran-Vasudan $w Intelligence $w (GTVI)$|. 

Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the $y GTVA$|."

47, "(fr)Your Assignment

Missions with the $w Special $w Operations $w Command are carried out deep in enemy territory, with minimal logistical support. Our behind-the-lines activities include infiltration, sabotage, surgical strikes, and intelligence gathering. 

You will be working undercover within the $h Neo-Terran $h Front, leading Alpha wing of the $w 185th fighter squadron."

48, "(fr)Lt. Commander Snipes

Your contact in this mission is $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Christopher $w Snipes, an allied officer who staged his defection to the $h NTF six months ago. As squadron leader of the $w 185th, $w Snipes will advise you of your mission objectives both as an $h NTF pilot and as an allied operative.

You will be equipped with a device that will enable you and $w Snipes to communicate over a secure frequency in battle. $h NTF ships will interpret your transmissions as targeting data."

49, "(fr)The ETAK Project

The focus of this covert operation is the $h NTF's $b ETAK project. Because access to information is restricted to the highest echelon, our knowledge here is limited. $b ETAK involves the development of a new, cutting-edge technology, possibly a weapon of mass destruction. 

$w Admiral $w Bosch oversees the project directly, and the rebels are constructing a prototype on the $h Iceni command ship. We need to get a closer look. Even a scan of the $h Iceni would be valuable."

50, "(fr)A Final Warning

We are working with the full cooperation of $f Vasudan $f Tactical $f Command and the $f Terran $f 6th $f Fleet$|. The probability that you will engage allied fighters will be minimal. However, should you come under allied attack, you have limited authorization to return fire in self-defense or to complete your mission objectives as defined by $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|. 

Show restraint, and use your judgement."

51, "(fr)This is $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|. For all you replacement pilots, welcome to the $w 185th$|. As you know, $w Admiral $w Koth's defeat in $b Epsilon $b Pegasi has opened the $b Polaris system to allied attack. At 1425 hours, $h GTVA expeditionary forces crossed our jump node blockade. The $h Colossus won't be far behind."

52, "(fr)$w Bosch isn't taking chances. We're moving the $f Iceni command ship to the $b Regulus system, where $w Bosch will install his provisional government. We've practiced this drill before, pilots. $f Alpha and $f Beta wing will escort the $f Iceni to the jump node. $f Delta, you're on standby."

53, "(fr)The $b Regulus node is located within a small asteroid field. Our job is to clear a path. Asteroids on a collision course with the $f Iceni will be indicated in white brackets on your HUD. That's how you know which asteroids to shoot. The gunners on the $f Iceni will help us out, so we shouldn't have too much trouble."

54, "(fr)All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is we got the Iceni and the Hinton to Regulus. The scan data you collected has been transmitted to the GTVI, and our operation to uncover the secret of ETAK continues as planned.

The bad news is we're in a lot more danger than I think you realize. The Vasudan warships were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our activities. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure has made the rebels just a little suspicious.

As usual, the GTVA is overplaying its hand. Ahmose and his subordinates now face a court martial for insubordination. The rebs are all over that one. Not only did the Admiral know the position of the Iceni, he wasn't authorized to act on that information. Our squadron will be high on the NTF's list of suspects. 

One more thing. The pilots under Ahmose's command had been informed of his renegade status before they launched their attack. Under these circumstances, we had little choice but to return fire or blow the entire operation.

Watch your back, pilot.  This ain't gonna get any easier. "

55, "(fr)All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is the Iceni has been destroyed along with Admiral Bosch and the ETAK project, whatever that was. 

The bad news is the allied warships that attacked the Iceni were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our operation. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure to Regulus has made the rebels just a little suspicious. Counterintel double-checked the dossiers of all new pilots and found some discrepancies in your file.

As your superior officer, it is my duty to inform you that you will be executed at 2100 hours for crimes of espionage and high treason. Sorry it had to end this way, pilot."

56, "(fr)You did not have authorization to return to base. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the NTF's objectives in this theatre. Unless Command decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Neo-Terran Front.

You will be confined to the brig pending your execution at 2100."

90, "(fr)As you have no doubt already heard, the $h GVD $h Psamtik has destroyed the $f NTD $f Cyrene, flagship of the $b Sirius fleet. As bad as things look in $b Polaris, the situation in $b Sirius is even worse. $w Bosch has redeployed our battle group to reinforce $f NTF positions in that system."

91, "(fr)We arrive in $b Sirius in six hours. The $w 185th will be deployed immediately to rendezvous with the $f NTT $f Sunder$|. Our mission will be to escort the transport back to the $b Regulus jump node. The cargo on board the $f Sunder has been classified well beyond my level of clearance. Let's just say if the $f Sunder goes down, so do we."

92, "(fr)The Alliance is fighting to secure the $b Alpha $b Centauri and $b Deneb jump nodes, so intelligence believes the risk of engagement will be low. Of course, that's what they told us in $b Polaris, where we got jumped by half the Vasudan armada. Expect the unexpected, kids, and report to the flight deck at 1310 sharp. Dismissed."

93, "(fr)Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The C.O. of the Sevrin has taken the brunt of Bosch's wrath for the Sunder's alleged destruction. The captain and his lieutenants have faced a summary court martial and will be executed at 0700. When you sign up for the wrong outfit, you get what you deserve.

This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. The rebs are nuts, but they're not slow. It won't take them long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence. If it looks like they're on to you, your duty as an operative of the GTVI is to escape and report everything you know to allied forces. Understood?"

94, "(fr)Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The destruction of the Hamaka forced our hand. The rebs are now fully aware that we're card-carrying members of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, we achieved the objectives of this covert operation. It wouldn't have taken the rebs long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence.

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. It's been an honor working with you, pilot. Good luck!"

95, "(fr)You may proceed to the next GTVI mission only if the Hamako and Sunder survive."

96, "(fr)With the destruction of the Sunder, our heist failed. With only our scan of the Iceni to go on, unraveling the secret of Bosch's ETAK project will be nearly impossible. We invested six months into this operation and came away empty-handed. 

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. Sorry your tour with the GTVI wasn't more successful, pilot. You had potential."

127, "(fr)Stand down, Beta 1. We followed our orders to the letter. Now get back to base before the Vasudans return. There's nothing more we can do out here."

128, "(fr)You see the Hamako? That's the new AWACS ship. We're using it to block all enemy transmissions. As long as that ship remains operational, no one on the outside will know what we're up to. As far as the NTF is concerned, we're still loyal and devoted rebel pilots."

129, "(fr)So watch the Hamako, all right? If we lose the AWACS, our cover's blown for good."

130, "(fr)Keep your eye on the ball, kids. We're almost there. But if that decoy doesn't get here real soon, we'll have to bail."

With the $h 13th and $h 11th $h Vasudan $h Battle $h Groups advancing, we have a hard fight ahead of us. If we lose $b Sirius, our backs will be against the wall. The $f NTF has fought too hard to surrender now."

141, "(fr)The $h 4th $h Fleet, based in $b Vega, is providing the Vasudans with logistical support. They've established a cargo depot near the $b Alpha $b Centauri jump node. Recon reports a perimeter defense of 16 sentry guns, and fighter patrols inspect the depot at regular intervals. The $w 185th has been called in to sever that supply line. All targets are of Terran construction."

142, "(fr)Our attack will be timed between fighter patrols. Our objective is to destroy all cargo and sentry guns. Once we secure the area, we'll be in a position to ambush allied targets. The attack should lure the enemy to the depot and improve our odds in more critical engagements deeper in the system."

143, "(fr)We are lucky to get you back alive, pilot. Our deep-cover operatives stashed vital schematic data in your fighter's on board computer. With this information, GTVI analysts will be able to unravel the enigma of Bosch's ETAK project. 

These operatives also advised us of your impending execution. Unfortunately, we have no information concerning the whereabouts or status of Lieutenant Commander Snipes. We fear the odds of his survival are not favorable.

In recognition of your outstanding service to the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence and Special Operations Command, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross. With this honor, you are now one of an elite few. 

We will bring you as far as Vega, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine and continue with your next squadron assignment. Congratulations on a successful tour with the GTVI."

144, "(fr)You willfully fired upon and destroyed a civilian transport. Allied Command has expressed its shock and dismay that an allied officer would indulge in the slaughter of innocent people. 

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae."

You have been selected for a covert assignment with $w Special $w Operations $w Command $w (SOC), in conjunction with $w Galactic $w Terran-Vasudan $w Intelligence $w (GTVI)$|. Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the $y GTVA$|."

At 0437 reconnaissance units received a coded transmission from $w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Snipes$|. The Commander's vessel, the $f NTT $f Grall, is now adrift in a Shivan-infested region of the nebula and will not survive much longer. The $f Grall was docked to the $h NTC $h Alexandria when the cruiser ran our blockade of the Knossos portal in $b Gamma $b Draconis$|."

172, "(fr)S.O.S.

Here is part of the actual transmission.  We processed the message to enable better comprehension:

Granite Mountain, this is Black Dove requesting immediate extraction.  Engines and jump drives are inoperative.  Location, Delta 429 by 372.  Deployed Pharos beacons to assist search.  Heavy Shivan presence. Severe nebula storms.  Probability of survival not good."

173, "(fr)Allied Retreat

As you know, Allied forces are in full retreat to $b Gamma $b Draconis, so logistical support will be virtually non-existent. We have no available reinforcements and only one recovery ship. We're operating in a Shivan-infested area, so expect a fierce enemy offensive. The odds are against you on this one, pilot."

174, "(fr)You know why you're here, pilot, so let's get down to work. Recon located a $y Pharos navigation buoy not far from where $w Snipes's transmission was received. Your wing will be inserted at that position to find the $f Grall and make contact with $w Snipes$|. His transport has been incapacitated, and there's a high probability he's already a goner."

175, "(fr)This sector of the nebula is extremely volatile. Recon reports heavy EM interference, scrambling sensors and communications. These buoys are the only chance we have of finding $w Snipes and the $f Grall$|. The EM storm will make aspect lock difficult to acquire and maintain, so we recommend you loadout with $y Tempests and $y Rockeyes$|."

176, "(fr)Once you locate $w Snipes, call in $f Lambda $f 1$|. This is critical. Do not deploy the recovery craft until you are ready. Our transport will dock with the $f Grall and extract the survivors. You'll need to buy them some time as they complete this procedure. Good hunting. "

177, "(fr)Congratulations, pilot. You saved my life, and I owe you big. If I had more clout with the brass, I'd have them give you a Service Medallion, but they don't just hand those out. You didn't have to volunteer for this assignment, but I'm damn glad you did.

Now here's an important lesson. SOC didn't mount a rescue op because they liked me. They did it because I had information they needed, and information is what keeps you alive out here. Now I'm heading up the 99th for another mission, and I think we're going need you on this one. I already cleared it with Command, so it's your call, pilot. Hope you do the right thing."

178, "(fr)Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes distinguished himself as one of the best operatives ever to serve in the SOC. His courage, resourcefulness, and determination helped us defeat Admiral Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front. Snipes worked deep-cover for over six months, advising the GTVI of the enemy's movements, strategies, and capabilities. His career will stand as a shining example of service and sacrifice to the GTVA and the ideals for which the Alliance stands.

Lieutenant Commander Snipes is hereby posthumously awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the GTVA Special Operations Command. I know of no officer more worthy of such recognition."

Unfortunately, we failed to destroy a single one of those Shivan devices. The Alliance demands top-notch flying from its elite squads, and our performance out there was a little disappointing. At least we were able to warn the Alliance.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

To the officers and crew of the $f GTD $f Aquitaine, this is $w Admiral $w Petrarch$|. At 0115 hours, we received a transmission from $f 3rd $f Fleet $f Headquarters. A Shivan cruiser and three fighter wings ambushed and destroyed the $f GTC $f Vigilant as it patrolled the $b Gamma $b Draconis jump node in the $b Capella system.

$b Gamma $b Draconis is a remote, uninhabited system discovered shortly before the outbreak of the $y Great $y War$|. The system has no planets and no viable resources. The $f GTSC $f Erikson visited the system 15 years ago and reported nothing out of the ordinary."

Recon flights in $b Gamma $b Draconis detected activity near an uncharted jump node. Closer examination has revealed this node is not a natural phenomenon but a massive subspace portal of unknown origin.

With the $b Gamma $b Draconis system secure, a task force of Terran and Vasudan scientists is now examining the subspace portal. At this point, the scientists have ruled out the possibility the device is of Shivan origin. 

$w Dr. $w Mina $w Hargrove, leader of the research team, has issued a report of its preliminary findings. An excerpt of this report follows."

723, "(fr)Dr. Hargrove, Task Force Preliminary Findings (Excerpt)

The subspace portal is unlike any Shivan construction we have yet encountered. Though Shivans demonstrate considerable diversity as a species, all Shivan technology possesses certain distinctive properties. None is present in the subspace device, which means we must look elsewhere for the portal's origin. We do know that the device is very, very old, on the order of several thousand years."

724, "(fr)Subspace Vortices

The field generated by the interlocking movement of the portal's components creates a subspace vortex, connecting one part of the universe to another.  $w Dr. $w Hargrove theorizes that whoever built this device may have used it to stabilize a jump node on the verge of collapse. 

If $w Dr. $w Hargrove is correct, this technology is a tremendous discovery."

725, "(fr)A Way Home?

By constructing our own portal, we might be able to reopen the $b Sol jump node in $b Delta $b Serpentis$|. Since the destruction of the $h Lucifer caused the node to collapse thirty-two years ago, $b Earth has remained isolated from the $y GTVA$|. 

We might also be able to stabilize subspace nodes that are currently too volatile for travel, thus creating routes to systems previously unexplored."

726, "(fr)Beyond the Portal

Our military operation will focus on what lies on the other side of the subspace portal. We must determine where the node leads and the extent of the Shivan presence there. Above all, we must prevent the Shivans from returning to $b Gamma $b Draconis$|. 

Because the portal will remain active while the research team studies the technology, our systems are vulnerable to attack.  Allied Command has deemed this an acceptable risk given the potential benefits."

727, "(fr)At 1540 hours, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered the subspace portal in $b Gamma $b Draconis and jumped to our current position. We have entered a nebula, a vast and dense ionized field, and possibly the remnant of a supernova. We have travelled farther than any Terrans in the history of subspace travel. "

728, "(fr)The nebula has severely limited the $f Aquitaine's long-range sensors. We are deploying our fighter wings to explore the immediate vicinity and determine the extent of the enemy presence. Each fighter squadron will deploy a flight of four wings. "

729, "(fr)$f Alpha, $f Zeta, $f Iota, and $f Kappa will patrol a series of four waypoints. $f Zeta wing will lead this sortie, so follow $f Zeta $f 1 and do not stray. Be advised the nebula could interfere with your on-board systems. The ionized field will compromise your sensors, even within combat range. "

730, "(fr)You confronted an overwhelming Shivan force in a hostile environment. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you or anyone else could have done to save the Trinity and our boarding party. You were lucky to survive this sortie, pilot. 

We have heard nothing from Kappa wing since they vanished from our sensors. Unfortunately, we must presume the worst. They will be listed MIA unless we find evidence to the contrary. Our search parties have found no trace of these fighters. 

The presence of the Trinity deepens the enigma of the NTF's secret agenda. What was the Trinity doing out here, and what does Bosch know about the subspace portal?

We have secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis, and we have demonstrated our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. We have proven without a doubt that we have the firepower to neutralize any Shivan threat. 

A new class of intercept fighter will be stationed on board the Aquitaine. I have recommended that you be transferred to this unit. Interceptors are fast, high-performance fighters requiring pilots with good reflexes. You've got the talent for it, and you'll represent the Ravens well.

With the heavy casualties we have suffered, Admiral Petrarch will reorganize the Aquitaine's fighter squadrons. As captain of the 107th Ravens, it is my sad duty to report that after forty years of service, our unit will be disbanded.

Meanwhile, the $f 13th $f Vasudan $f Battle $f Group has destroyed the $h NTD $h Cyrene and gained foothold in $b Sirius$|. Intelligence reports that $w Admiral $w Bosch and his elite guard have withdrawn to the rebel enclave of $b Regulus$|. 

Command anticipates a total allied victory in less than 30 days."

1035, "(fr)The Subspace Portal

$w Dr. $w Hargrove's task force has determined that the subspace portal in $b Gamma $b Draconis was constructed by the $y Ancients, an extinct civilization discovered near the end of the $y Great $y War$|. Artifacts excavated in the $b Altair system contained data that enabled the $f GTA and $f PVN to destroy the $h SD $h Lucifer$|. Many Terran and Vasudan systems once belonged to the $y Ancients' empire, which the Shivans obliterated eight thousand years ago. The portal has been renamed $b $y Knossos, after the Earth's Minoan civilization."

1036, "(fr)The Deneb Connection

Intelligence has learned that $w Bosch acquired $y Ancient materials from an excavation site in the $b Deneb system. These artifacts somehow enabled $w Bosch to locate and activate the $y Knossos portal. This explains the presence of the Admiral's command ship in the $b Deneb asteroid belt. $w Bosch then sent the $h NTC $h Trinity into $b Gamma $b Draconis to activate the portal, which lured the Shivans into that system. 

We do not know $w Bosch's motives or what the Shivans are doing in the nebula."

1037, "(fr)Nostos

Allied scientists studying the portal remain optimistic about the potential for this technology. In five to ten years, we might be able to restore contact with $b Earth or create new jump nodes to unexplored regions of the galaxy. For this reason, the portal must remain open for as long as possible. 

Command has issued a standing order to destroy the device should a full-scale invasion be imminent."

1038, "(fr)Our Objectives

The destruction of the $h Ravana has intensified Shivan activity in the nebula. The Shivan fleet appears to be smaller than the armada we defeated three decades ago, and our improved technology gives us a tactical advantage. However, with the possibility of uncharted jump nodes leading to more Shivan-infested systems, we cannot know with any certainty the full extent of the enemy force. 

A miscalculation on our part could unleash the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1039, "(fr)New Technologies

The $f Aquitaine will spearhead the next phase of our exploration and containment operation in the nebula. To help us achieve our objectives, the Alliance has developed new technologies, including Advanced Warning And Control Systems, or $y AWACS, and gas mining vessels to gather deuterium for our fusion reactors. 

Prototypes of these new tactical weapons and fighters will be deployed pending successful completion of field tests. The $w 134th $w Barracudas will be conducting these combat exercises near the $b Gamma $b Draconis jump node."

1040, "(fr)GTW ML-70 Morning Star

Two next-generation weapons are now available: the $y Morning $y Star and the $y EMP $y Missile$|. The $y GTW $y ML-70 $y Morning $y Star improves upon the $y Flail gun developed during the $y Great $y War$|. Recent advances in high-temperature optics enable the primary focusing chamber of the $y Morning $y Star to produce a more coherent charge. Though an energy weapon, the $y Morning $y Star has a powerful kinetic effect on its target."

1041, "(fr)EMP Missile

The $y EMP $y Missile interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within the blast radius of the warhead. The detonation scrambles targeting data and jams communications. Tactically, the $y EMP is an effective anti-bomber weapon. It prevents these craft from acquiring aspect lock and temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight."

1042, "(fr)Welcome to the $w 134th $w Barracudas, pilot. I'm $w Commander $w Vincey, your squadron leader. The $w 134th is a combat evaluation unit, or $w CEU, which means we're among the first to test new ships and weapons in the field. While we carry out our missions, engineers will gather data on the systems we've been assigned to test."

1043, "(fr)In this mission, our primary objective is to escort two $y Triton$|-class freighters, the $f Erinpura and the $f Vauban$|. They will enter the nebula at the $b Gamma $b Draconis node and travel to their waypoint, where they will rendezvous with the $f GTCv $f Warspite$|. Their cargo is the new $y Target $y Acquisition and $y Guidance missile system. "

1044, "(fr)The $f GTA $f Lucidity will provide $y AWACS support for this mission. With its powerful sensor array, the $f Lucidity will transmit targeting data to your fighter, effectively increasing your sensor range. The $w 134th will be the first to test the system in the nebula."

1045, "(fr)Now keep in mind that the C in $w CEU stands for Combat. These aren't controlled laboratory experiments. Shivan activity has intensified, so you can expect to engage some $h Maras and $h Cains out there. If the action gets too intense, call in reinforcements at your discretion. Good luck, pilot."

1046, "(fr)Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation. As we speak, analysts are reviewing the data from our flight recorders. The entire squadron has been grounded pending the conclusion of this inquiry.

Command considers this deployment of the AWACS to be a total failure."

1047, "(fr)It is essential that you concentrate your efforts on enemy bombers. You also have reinforcements at your disposal. You would be well advised to make efficient use of them."

1048, "(fr)Though we lost a freighter in this engagement, the combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios. On the other hand, your unit's failure to protect the AWACS indicates that more effective leadership may be required here."

1049, "(fr)Both the Erinpura and the Vauban survived the Shivan attack. The combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios.

1050, "(fr)Both the Erinpura and the Vauban survived the Shivan ambush. The combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite on this exercise. 

Command rates the initial deployment of the AWACS a complete success. Our improved sensor capability gave us the tactical advantage we required to respond quickly and decisively to the Shivan attack. 

Prepare your wing for your next sortie, pilot. The TAG missile combat field test begins at 0315."

The $f Warspite will supervise this combined arms exercise."

1084, "(fr)The $w 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the $y Target $y Acquisition and $y Guidance missile. This will be the first deployment of this system in an actual combat exercise. Our laboratory simulations indicate it has significant potential as a tactical weapon. "

1085, "(fr)When you hit a target with the $y TAG warhead, the missile's beacon will illuminate the target for allied capital ships within range. All available firepower will be brought to bear for a quick resolution. This technology could be a decisive advantage for the $y GTVA$|. In this exercise, we will test the prototype $y TAG-A$|."

1086, "(fr)Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your $y TAG$|s. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness.

1088, "(fr)For this mission, you'll be flying a refurbished $y Ulysses space superiority fighter, specially modified for this exercise. The $y Ulysses is a $y Great $y War antique, but the fighter still handles well, and the modifications will enable $y TAG engineers to monitor the progress of the exercise. "

1089, "(fr)Though this exercise did not proceed as planned, the 134th met the challenge head-on and defended our warships admirably. 

Overall, this field deployment of the TAG missile exceeded our expectations. Research and Development is now working on improvements to the TAG-A prototype, including an aspect-seeking warhead and a more maneuverable projectile. These enhancements should make the TAG a versatile weapon for our tactical wings."

1090, "(fr)The destruction of the Warspite was a senseless tragedy. The lives of Captain Forsythe and his crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise. The 134th was called upon to get our warships out of a difficult situation, and we failed. As leader of Alpha wing, re-evaluate this scenario carefully. What could you have done to save the Warspite?"

1091, "(fr)You must make careful use of every TAG missile you are alotted.  Since they are unguided missiles you are advised to get as close to your target as possible.  Once an enemy is TAG'ed move clear quickly so you don't take friendly fire."

The unusual design of the $y Pegasus minimizes the EM signature emitted by the fighter, making it all but impossible to detect with sensors. This exercise will be the first simulation of the $y Pegasus under combat conditions in the nebula environment."

1129, "(fr)$f Alpha wing, your objective is to defend the $f GTC $f Oberon, a decommissioned $y Fenris cruiser. The $f Oberon has served the Alliance since the $y Great $y War, and most of its systems have been stripped down to repair other cruisers in circulation. Flying the $y Pegasus prototypes, $f Delta wing will attack the $f Oberon. Your job is to repel their offensive."

1130, "(fr)Your weapons will be neutralized for the duration of the test. Though you may fire your lasers and missiles, they will inflict only superficial damage against $f Delta wing. Engineers on board the $f GTD $f Aquitaine will monitor the progress of the exercise and gather data to verify the stealth capability and combat potential of the $y Pegasus$|."

1131, "(fr)The Shivans destroyed the Aquitaine. Without this ship, our operations in the nebula are in jeopardy. Though we were outnumbered and outgunned, the Aquitaine went down on our watch. The 10,000 officers and crew who perished were our friends and comrades. The 134th is the disgrace of the allied fleet. 

Because we serve on the front lines, the brass think it's our duty to take the fall for their mistakes. As your squadron leader, I will testify on your behalf. More wings should have been deployed to cover the Aquitaine's retreat. However, until Command completes its inquiry, you will be stripped of your wings and held in custody. You are dismissed, pilot."

The Moloch and its fighters inflicted severe damage, and repair crews are now working to get the destroyer back on line. Nevertheless, your actions saved thousands of lives.

The 64th Raptors are in need of bomber pilots. I've recommended that you be transferred. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

1388, "(fr)Your reconnaissance of the $h Sathanas identified weak points in the Juggernaut's defenses. However, exploiting these weaknesses will require firepower that can be provided only by the main guns of our capital ships. The $f GVD $f Psamtik, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine, and the $f GVD $f Toeris are standing by. Your mission is to lure the $h Sathanas into position."

1389, "(fr)In the first phase, you will attack the $h SC $h Rephaim, a $y Rakshasa$|-class warship. Our recon flights have located the $h Rephaim near the allied secure zone. The cruiser is accompanied by two wings comprised of $y Mara -class fighters. Our analysis of the $h Rephaim's flight pattern suggests the vessel is patrolling the region."

1390, "(fr)Your first task is to eliminate the fighter escort. This must be achieved quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Once the escort has been neutralized, call in $f Delta wing. The bombers will help you destroy the $h Rephaim. If necessary, your wing will need to incapacitate the cruiser's beam turrets to clear a path for your bombers."

1391, "(fr)We anticipate the attack on the $h Rephaim will bring Shivan reinforcements.  Your squadron is charged with the duty of engaging and destroying these hostiles until the $h Sathanas arrives. $f Sigma wing will also be available to assist, once these bombers have returned from their current sortie."

1392, "(fr)The upgraded $y Target $y Acquisition and $y Guidance warhead is now available. The $y TAG-B, an aspect-seeking missile, features an improved shock-resistant substrate that enables the beacon to transmit data with greater precision.  The $f GVCv $f Sopedu will provide fire support for this operation."

For this reason, our destroyers will not be deployed unless the $h Sathanas appears in your field of engagement.  If we fail to lure the $h Sathanas, or if the $h Juggernaut engages our forces elsewhere, we will abort this mission."

The Shivan Juggernaut $h Sathanas is now en route to the jump node leading to Terran-Vasudan space. Command ordered all units to rally in $b Gamma $b Draconis in three hours' time. Though we have accounted for most of our fleet, at least six warships have failed to reach the rendezvous point. We can wait for them no longer.  The $f GTVA $f Security $f Council has authorized the immediate destruction of the $y Knossos Subspace Portal."

To demolish the $y Knossos Portal, we will detonate the $y Meson $y Bomb, an experimental new weapon under development at the $w Hideki $w Institute in the $b Vega system. Though its specifications are highly classifed, physicists claim the $y Meson $y Bomb has more explosive power than any other warhead in our arsenal, sufficient to destroy any small craft within a three-kilometer radius. The size of the bomb prohibits tactical deployment."

1431, "(fr)Allied Strategy

A small task force will oversee the demolition of the $y Knossos while the bulk of the allied fleet blockades the jump node leading to the densely-populated $b Capella system. Command has begun the process of evacuating the two hundred fifty million civilians inhabiting $b Capella, the largest exodus since the $y Great $y War$|. The $f Colossus will remain in that system to engage the $h Sathanas should we fail."

1432, "(fr)At 2230 hours, the $y GTVA announced its plan for the destruction of the $y Knossos device. For strategic and scientific reasons, we will not attack the portal with the main guns of our warships. The demolition of the subspace portal will be accomplished with the use of the experimental $y Meson $y Bomb$|."

1433, "(fr)Our first objective will be to sanitize the area. Observers report that Shivan scouting wings have already entered $b Gamma $b Draconis, and enemy activity will intensify before the arrival of the $h Sathanas $h Juggernaut$|. The $f Renenet, a $y Sobek$|-class corvette, will monitor the operation and provide fire support."

1434, "(fr)Once we have eliminated the enemy presence, a freighter carrying the $y Meson warhead will deposit the bomb at the detonation site. This is the first deployment of the weapon prototype. Because computer simulations predict only a forty percent chance of success, we have two more warheads standing by."

1435, "(fr)We demolished the portal but to no avail.  The subspace vortex generated by the Knossos device has stabilized, and the Sathanas entered the Gamma Draconis system. Our forces are standing by to intercept the juggernaut at the Capella jump node.

We do not know how long the nebula jump node will remain open. In theory, it could be centuries before it collapses again. Scientists assure us that we have gathered sufficient data to reconstruct the Knossos, but a project of that magnitude would take decades to complete.

1436, "(fr)We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to avert this catastrophe."

1437, "(fr)Nevertheless, your tenacity is impressive. You eliminated all Shivan fighters. You are a credit to your species. Vasudan Tactical Command has taken note of your performance."

1438, "(fr)The destruction of the freighter was unacceptable, Terran. You have sufficient combat experience to understand that freighters and transports are vulnerable targets, and they require fighter support in hostile environments. In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

When $w Bosch realized his regime was on the brink of collapse, he ordered his forces into the nebula to make contact with the enemy. Interrogation of rebel prisoners reveals that only $w Bosch's immediate subordinates had access to the $b ETAK project. No further details are available at your level of clearance."

1600, "(fr)Circe

You are now authorized to use the $y GTW-19 $y Circe$|. Derived from advanced EM weaponry, the $y Circe disrupts shield systems by directing a barrage of fluctuating EM harmonics on the target. This energy is completely ineffective against armor plating or insulated subsystems. For this reason, the $y Circe is best paired with a weapon such as the $y Maxim or the $y Prometheus, which inflict heavy hull damage."

1601, "(fr)Reconnaissance has located the $h NTF $h Iceni$|. $w Bosch has made contact with the Shivans a second time. An $y Azrael$|-class transport is currently docked with the vessel. A second transport appears to be waiting nearby. We do not know if the Shivans are boarding the $h Iceni, or if $w Bosch and his followers are boarding the transports."

1602, "(fr)Our objective is to capture the $h Iceni and the $b ETAK technology. Two Shivan cruisers are guarding the vessel, the $h Azmedaj and the $h Sammael. Once the cruisers have been destroyed, we will deploy a Special Forces unit to board and secure the rebel command ship. Your second objective will be to defend our transport, the $f GTT $f Qeb$|."

1603, "(fr)To our knowledge, the $h Iceni holds the only example of the $b ETAK technology in existence. $w Bosch took extraordinary measures to destroy all evidence of his research. If we fail, we have little hope of rebuilding the device. Command has absolute faith in your ability to succeed in this endeavor."

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack.

We arrived too late to stop the Azrael transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his immediate subordinates. Our questioning of the survivors reveals the encounter had been violent. The motives of the Shivans cannot be determined, though it seems Bosch's experiment attracted their attention. Reconnaissance is now searching for the Shivan transport.

Against overwhelming odds, you destroyed the Shivan cruisers, protected the Iceni, and escorted the transport safely home. It is indeed an honor to serve with a pilot of your caliber."

With over one hundred thousand casualties and more Shivans incoming, we have no hope of holding $b Capella$|. Our only real chance is to seal off the system and prevent the invasion from spreading to other Terran-Vasudan worlds. If we fail to contain the Shivan advance, we will unleash the second $y Great $y War, a conflict we have virtually no chance of surviving.

Over 80 Shivan Juggernauts are now in position around the $b Capella sun. Science vessels monitoring their activity have detected an anomalous subspace field rippling from the Juggernaut fleet. Though we can barely detect the field with our instruments, its intensity has been increasing slowly over the past seventy-two hours.

Preparations are now underway to collapse the $b Epsilon $b Pegasi jump node.

Scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse, as evidenced by the destruction of the $h Lucifer 32 years ago. The detonation of the $h Lucifer's reactors sealed off the $b Sol jump node in $b Delta $b Serpentis and severed all contact with $b Earth$|.

Skeptics have argued the Shivans made intersystem jumps without using nodes in $b Ross $b 128, $b Ikeya, $b Vega, and other systems at the outbreak of the $y Great $y War$|. However, scientists assure us this plan will work. Though Shivans have used uncharted nodes and nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels, they are as dependent on jump nodes as we are. Nevertheless, we must accept this strategy as nothing more than a temporary measure."

Once we have evacuated all civilian and military personnel from the $b Capella system, we will send a second destroyer, also carrying $y Meson warheads, through the $b Capella jump node in $b Vega$|. If we succeed in sealing off both nodes, the Alliance will have trapped the Shivans in this system. If we fail, we face certain annihilation. 

This is our Alamo, pilots. We hold them here, or we die trying."

1875, "(fr)Your mission is to create a diversion at the $b Gamma $b Draconis node. The operation here will be a feint to lure the Shivan armada. The $f Colossus and its group will form a battle line near the node. By focusing our firepower here, we'll draw the brunt of the Shivan offensive. Meanwhile, on the other side of the system, the $f Bastion will collapse the node to $b Epsilon $b Pegasi$|."

$w Lieutenant $w Commander $w Cordova here. Welcome to the $w 242nd $w Suicide $w Kings, pilot. I've heard from unofficial channels that the rebels have launched a surprise attack in the $b Epsilon $b Pegasi system. Details at this point are sketchy below $b Phi level clearance, and Command is in no hurry to fill us in. Petrarch says he'll brief the $f Aquitaine when we reach $b Capella$|."

2444, "(fr)The 242nd Suicide Kings

The GTA formed the $w Suicide $w Kings in the $y Great $y War, when the old $y Valkyrie fighter went into service after the Shivan attack on $b Ross $b 128$|. The $w 242nd was stationed on the $f Galatea back then, and our first mission was the capture of $w Lieutenant $w Alexander $w McCarthy$|. We all studied the McCarthy trials in school, pilot. We're a part of history here, though the $f Galatea is long gone and the $y Valkyrie has since been retired."

2445, "(fr)The Perseus Interceptor

The $y Perseus is the next-generation interceptor, the fastest fighter in the $y GTVA$|. Our primary combat role is charging bombers and chasing down warheads. We're also assigned to surgical strikes against bigger warships. We're not called the $w Suicide $w Kings for nothing, pilot. We earn that name on every mission. For that reason, I suggest you review the $y Perseus training modules as soon as possible. There you'll learn how to target bombs and turrets and everything else you need to serve in an intercept squadron."

2446, "(fr)Stiletto II

You are now authorized to use the $y GTM-43a $y Stiletto $y II missile, designed to incapacitate subsystems. The 43a improves on the original $y Stiletto design by modifying its guidance systems and disruptor charge. The $y Stiletto also boasts a more powerful propulsion system, increasing its speed and effective range."
