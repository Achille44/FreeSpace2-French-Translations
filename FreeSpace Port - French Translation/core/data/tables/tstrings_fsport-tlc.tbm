                                      The FreeSpace 2 Launcher
                                     ----------------------------------------------

The Launcher's buttons enable you to set up and play FreeSpace 2,
customize your hardware settings, get updated versions of the game,
and access the FreeSpace 2 web pages at Volition, Inc.
Here's what each button does:


PLAY
  Click this button to launch FreeSpace 2.


SETUP
  Under Setup, you'll see tabs for Video, Audio, Joystick, Speed,
Network, DirectX, and Misc.
"

5242, "
  * Video - You must have a 3D Accelerator card to play FreeSpace 2.
You can choose to have FreeSpace 2 detect Glide only, D3D only, or both
by selecting the proper checkboxes, then clicking on the 'Detect
Available Cards' button.
     - 'Interlaced Cutscenes' - When displaying ingame movies, draws
every other line (interlaced mode) so that slower video cards have an
easier time.
     - 'Fast Clear for Cutscenes' - Speeds up movie playback by not
clearing the background buffer when a new frame is being rendered.
     - 'Fast D3D Textures' - Improves your video and gameplay
performance, but at a cost to the visual quality of FreeSpace 2. Enable
fast D3D textures *only* if you are experiencing severe slowdown during
gameplay.
     - WFOG is a Direct3D-only option. 'Force WFOG' makes the D3D card
use WFOG (table-based rather than vertex-based fog) if available. Some
cards don't do WFOG properly (the S4, for example), so vertex fog is
used by default. Use this setting only for experimentation purposes.
     - 'Disable Direct3D Zbuffer Bias' - If you are a Direct3D user and are
experiencing strange rendering problems with squadron logos (specifically,
the logos rendering on top of everything else), checking this box should
resolve the problem.

  * Audio - FreeSpace 2 supports DirectSound, A3D, and EAX. You can
choose one of these by clicking on 'Detect Available Sound Cards' and
when selecting from the dropdown box. You can enable Launcher sounds
from here as well.
"

5243, "
  * Joystick - Enables you to set up or change the joystick used by
FreeSpace 2. Also lets you toggle Force Feedback support on or off (any
joystick supporting DirectX 6.0 force feedback may be used).

  * Speed - This setting determines the default Detail Level used in
FreeSpace 2 when new pilots are created. You may manually change this
default if you wish, but it may adversely affect your gameplay speed.

  * Network - Here you choose your connection type and speed for
multiplayer games. If playing on Volition's free PXO service, you can
enter your login name and password. The 'Force Local Port' option
enables the user to run a local copy of the game on a different network
port than the default (which is 7808). The 'PXO Banners' checkbox
enables banner displays while you're in PXO.

  * DirectX - On this tab you can check your DirectX version and choose
to install or update DirectX on your machine.

  * Misc. - On this tab, you choose the language (written and spoken)
in which all game text and messages appear. The 'Optional Command Line'
box enables the user to specify a set of command-line switches that are
passed to the game at startup. See the readme.txt file for available
commands.
"

5244, "
VIEW README
  Opens the readme.txt file for FreeSpace 2.


UPDATE
  This button enables you to see if a new version of FreeSpace 2 is
available for downloading. If one is available, you can choose to
update your version by clicking on OK. The process is automated.


HELP
  This opens a Help document containing information about the Launcher
buttons.


UNINSTALL
  Uninstalls FreeSpace 2 from your computer.


QUIT
  Closes the Launcher without running FreeSpace 2.


VOLITION LOGO
  This takes you to Volition's Internet home page.


PXO LOGO
  This takes you to the Internet home page for Parallax Online, a free
multiplayer service for Volition and Outrage games.

5409, "Small, fast dumbfire missiles - fired in swarms - low accuracy offset by high speed and immunity to electronic countermeasures - very small payload (2 Kt). 

A Vasudan missile design employing a 'twin fire' technique.  It is a good choice for close combat and freighter attacks, where tracking is a non-issue. The twin-fire design increases the payload per volley and damage potential for hit-and-run attacks.  The GTA is developing its own swarm missile based on the Fang."

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.

First mission in your tour aboard the GTD Nepenthe."

6830, "GTA Update:

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

6831, "Colonization Update

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies and defense for our frontier colonization efforts is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

6832, "At a recent press conference, Brian Giordino, president of HARC, issued the following statement, ''Although HARC despises the GTA's lust for universal domination and its tyranny over other alien cultures, we would never attempt to halt this evil with the blood of young Terran pilots.''"

6833, "EMAIL
To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

6834, "Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

6835, "Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destiny on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space.  Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy.  Omega One contains a drone pilot and no passengers.."

6838, "In order to secure the Destiny from a surprise assault, we have anchored her 8,000 km from the Beta Cygni jump node.  The Destiny is protected by her own fighter complement and a massive perimeter of sentry guns."

6839, "Beta Cygni Jump Node"

6840, "Unfortunately, due to these safety precautions, GTA ships traveling to the Destiny from Beta Cygni require an escort to the safety perimeter.  Alpha wing will escort Omega to the Destiny.  Once the transports have reached the safe zone, oversee their docking operations and then return to the GTD Nepenthe."

6841, "GTSG Cerberus 33"

6842, "The Destiny's fighters have been working back-breaking shifts since the rise of the mercenary rebellion.  Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

6843, "If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

6844, "Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

6845, "Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

6846, "Things got pretty rough out there.  You are to be commended for bringing your entire team back alive."

6847, "Although Delta wing really needed the rest, it is understandable that you called for reinforcements in the face of considerable opposition."

6848, "Try to complete the mission without calling for Delta wing."

6849, "The pilots on the GTD Destiny wish to thank you for handling the assignment without calling for them.  These weary pilots needed the rest badly."

6850, "We realize that things got pretty rough out there.  However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive.  With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

6851, "Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

6852, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

6853, "The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

6854, "Ultimately, this mission is a failure.  The personnel on board the Omega transports were the foremost experts on colonization science and technology.  Without them, we have little chance of successfully colonizing the new frontier planets."

6855, "The greatest threat to the Omega transport's is the wing of Athena bombers.  You may want to divide your wing and send some of Alpha to take the fighters, but make sure someone is taking care of those bombers."

The Terran Domestic Intelligence Agency concluded their investigation regarding recent rebel activities.  As suspected, the TDIA tracked the transfer of billions of credits from the HARC organization to the accounts of GTA pilots who have recently gone AWOL.  Brian Giordino, president of HARC was taken into custody early this morning and has been charged with high treason.  Giordino continues to proclaim his innocence and accuses the TDIA of setting him up."

The Vasudan ambassador has alerted us that the Vasudan Empire has chosen a new homeworld, Mandala Prime in the Manda system.  This news is troubling to the GTA because Mandala Prime was their greatest hope for successful colonization in the outer rim.  Of the hundreds of charted worlds, none is as environmentally similar to Earth as Mandala Prime and is obviously better suited for Terrans.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has already begun negotiations."

It is for diplomatic reasons only that we are performing this unconventional capture operation.  But please remember, this IS a capture operation.

6936, "The events which occurred today were both unexpected and beyond our control.  Although we were successful in forcing the Timberland into submission, we ultimately  lost the craft due to an apparent self-destruct.  The pilots we have debriefed have all reported hearing conflicting transmissions from the cruiser.  GTA Command only received one transmission which implicated the suicide."

6937, "Unfortunately, this mission is a failure.  Though the Timberland put up a good fight, she was ready to quit when the GTD Nepenthe jumped in.  We lost a fine ship today, but worse, we lost the ability to interrogate the Terran rebels."

The ruthless mercs lured a boarding party under the flag of surrender and then murdered them by self-destructing their own ship.

To: 17412@nepenthe.gta
This memo is being issued to select pilots aboard my ship.  The final page of the command briefing is either an honest mistake or a deliberate distortion of the truth.

Further, the E.L.F radio wave sent from Lockheed during the Timberland operation was apparently a trigger which detonated the bomb on board the Timberland.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to keep those mercs quiet about their employer.  We believe this someone to be Admiral Darcy.

The Galactic Terran Alliance wishes to issue a formal apology to Captain John Wallace and the crew of the Nepenthe.  This ship and its brave crew managed to unravel a conspiracy which stemmed from one of the highest ranked officers in the GTA Navy, Admiral Darcy.  Commendations to the fine men and women aboard the Alexander Bell who conducted the investigation with the Nepenthe.  Further, the GTA forgives their capital-ship killing special ops. unit for going AWOL.  The remaining stolen cruisers were destroyed along with the GTD Trinity and its commanding officer, Admiral Darcy."

Apparently, the Vasudan empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA, and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime.  Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded.  The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destiny has already begun evacuation."

7099, "Mandala Prime:

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

7100, "War:

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

Protect the Destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

7111, "Congratulations, pilot.  You accomplished your goals and managed to survive one of the most deadly engagements in the history of Terran Galactic War.  Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

7540, "Manhattan"

7541, "Because high tension still exists between our species, we must make the Manhattan's destruction look like an accident.

Reports over the wire already indicate an ''accident'' aboard a science vessel.  Great work!  The Vanguard's arrival was unexpected, but we handled it well.

7552, "Extra congratulations to you for bringing your team back in one piece."

7554, "Unfortunately, you weren't able to perform a scan of the Manhattan cargo.  Fortunately, it was only schematics...however, had the freighter entered subspace with an unstable warhead...many lives would have been lost."

''Today a patrol of Horus class fighters on patrol was attacked.  We do not know who the attackers were and all the sole surviving pilot was able to say before he lost consciousness was 'Today, I did not know who was the enemy....'.  Beware, Terran allies, for it seems the Shivans have a new weapon.''"

Luckily, the $f Barnett was carrying information which will help prevent this weapon from affecting us again. Good job, pilot!"

8078, "In addition, the arrival of the E-SRS comm relay as given us ears into the Delta Serpentis sector. We are no longer alone."

8080, "In addition, we appear to be cut off from the rest of the fleet. GTC Victory is currently fighting a desperate battle for survival on the other side of Delta Serpentis. For now, we are alone. But thanks to your wing and other stragglers, we are not without teeth."

8081, "Command is planning a series of forays into Delta Serpentis in the hopes of drawing pressure off of the Victory. Although we will undoubtedly draw the Shivans attention, we must save the Victory if we are to have any hope for survival."

Destroy the incoming bombers before they get too close."

8100, "The fact that you were able to carry out your primary objective despite the arrival of the life pod and the intervention of a Demon class destroyer is most impressive. Command has taken note of your handling of events."

8503, "Commander, you are going to take part in a dangerous gamble.  The Shivan cruiser Decahedron is travelling from the Ross 128 system to the Vega system, and you are being deployed in an attempt to ambush and destroy it."

8508, "The Decahedron is travelling with a light escort, but we suspect the Shivans will send reinforcements if they suffer heavy losses."

8509, "Alpha and Gamma squadrons will emerge from the asteroid field and engage the enemy fighters, providing cover for Beta squadron, who will attack the Decahedron."

8510, "Your ships have been outfitted with the new targeting systems and Avenger cannons, so you will be able to effectively attack the Shivans.  Unfortunately, the shield technology we have stolen is still being studied, and has not been implimented yet."

8511, "You managed to destroy the Decahedron despite the horrible odds stacked against you!  Excellent work commander!"

8512, "Amazing work commander!"

8513, "The Decahedron managed to escape.  Although the resistance you met was considerably greater than we anticipated, this is still a painful loss."

8514, "It got away!  Try again!"

8515, "The fact that you could not stop the Decahedron, even with the assistance of the Younge, is particularily disheartening."

8516, "Even the reinforcements didn't help?"

8517, "It is unfortunate that the Younge had to be called away from its duties to assit you, but we respect your appraisal of the situation."

8518, "Can you do it again, without reinforcements?"

8519, "Younge"

8520, "Destroy the Shivan cruiser Decahedron"

8526, "Pivit"

8527, "You will be positioned near to Nav Bouy 24. There you will oversee the docking proceedure and transfer of the tactical data. 

The GTT Elysium is carrying Vasuden Technicians who are hitching a ride back to Vasuda Prime. They will transfer to the Isis upon it's arrival."

8532, "Protect the transports at all costs."

8533, "We've just recieved a communication from the Vasuden High Council. They have reported that the captain of the Isis was a member of the Hammer of Light. 

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

Fortunatly due to your efforts the Elysium was not lost in vein. With the destruction of the Death Storm the Shivan attacks in this area appear to have dropped to almost non existant levels. Well Done."

8534, "Congratulations Pilot. Your performance during this mission was amazing."

8535, "We've just recieved a communication from the Vasuden High Command. They have reported that the captain of the Isis was a member of the Hammer of Light. 

As shocking as it is to hear that there are HOL members still at large, It was even more disturbing to have been setup by them. 

With the destuction of the the GTD Prometheus, the Shivan threat in this area appears to be on the increase. The loss of the Prometheus will be greatly mourned.

Dismissed."
