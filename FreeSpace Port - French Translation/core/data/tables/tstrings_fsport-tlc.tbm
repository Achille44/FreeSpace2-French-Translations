5706, "New Technology:

  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.
  The device first finds the nearest GTA communications beacon in the system. It then sends its coordinates to that station through a contained subspace portal.  All of the equipment is contained in a sensor-shielded container to prevent detection.  The SHB is simply a long-range homing device."

Hopefully the freighter will take its cargo to the Hammer of Light base,  and then we can launch an assault on them.  This is a very big step towards eliminating the Hammer of Light."

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.

Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5903, "However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

Yesterday afternoon, HARC disclosed its organization's funds.  Although HARC had repeatedly boasted itself as a multi-billion credit organization, with 200,000,000 members, HARC's funds only amount to about 57 million credits with a membership of around 850,000.  While HARC admits that they lied in an attempt to increase the popularity of their view, they can't possibly be the driving force behind this mercenary rebellion.  Giordino's charges were reduced from high treason to fraud."

In other news, the debate over Mandala Prime rages on.  While the Vasudans still bid for the planet as their homeworld, GTA Command still argues that it is better fit to support human colonization."

6010, "A captured GTA cruiser, the Timberland, piloted by mercenaries, engaged GTA forces in Manda yesterday.  The ruthless mercs lured a boarding party under the flag of surrender and then murdered them by self-destructing their own ship.  Admiral Darcy issued the following communique from Lockheed today, ''The price of our destiny to expand as a species has been paid in blood.  Perhaps it is time to consider the opinions of groups such as HARC.  For now, we will scale down our colonization efforts.''"

6011, "EMAIL:
To: 17412@nepenthe.gta
This memo is being issued to select pilots aboard my ship.  The final page of the command briefing is either an honest mistake or a deliberate distortion of the truth.  Through a coordinated effort with the Alexander Bell Comm Post, we have learned that the crew aboard the Timberland was as surprised as we were to see her self-destruct.  The vengeful message which implicated the suicide was actually transmitted from an unknown craft in the battle area!"

6012, "Cont...

Further, the E.L.F radio wave sent from Lockheed during the Timberland operation was apparently a trigger which detonated the bomb on board the Timberland.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to keep those mercs quiet about their employer.  We believe this someone to be Admiral Darcy.  Our own investigation reveals that Darcy was the driving force behind the scapegoating of Giordino.  Further, he was the commanding officer at Lockheed during the Timberland incident.  Keep quiet about this pilots.  We don't know who we can trust.

Under any other circumstances, I would have ordered this craft captured.  However, we don't have that luxury right now."

6063, "Although we didn't have much time to hail the Alexander Bell, it appears that our message was going through.  Unfortunately, the communications outpost was not responding.  Since we are so far away from our home system, we will need to relay our message off of the Alexander Bell."

Early this morning, the Alexander Bell Communication station was quarantined due to an outbreak of an unknown virus.  The outpost has been shut down and all transmission from Manda are being processed through the GTD Destiny."

Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

6091, "I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."
