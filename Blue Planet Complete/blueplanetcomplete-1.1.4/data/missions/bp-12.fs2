It happened again, the same dream. The dream about the Orestes. Every night for the past couple of nights, ever since we met up with the Sanctuary. I've just got this feeling that something terrible has happened, or is about to happen.

Maybe it's the feeling that I'm never going to see my father and the Orestes ever again...", 5430)

 XSTR("MESSAGE 1

To the officers and crew of the GTD Temeraire, and her accompanying ships.

We've made the trip through hell and come out of the other side. We withstood everything the Shivans threw at us to come to this place. We are now in uncharted territory, and have gone where no Terran or Vasudan has ever been in recorded history.

Since we have arrived here, no Shivan vessel has followed us through the Knossos portal. We do not yet know the reason for this, but have welcomed the respite. We've taken the opportunity to undergo minor repairs and send out reconnaissance flights to probe the immediate area. I'm keeping the battlegroup on heightened alertness, as action may come upon us at any time. Stay vigilant, and be ready to be on call should the time come.

Hey Commander,

Yes, it's me. Taylor. I just wanted to thank you, for, you know...being there for me and Corey. I know he wouldn't normally say anything, but we've been through a lot lately, and you've helped us out a lot in keeping us together.

Listen, I just wanted to say, if you ever need someone to watch your back out there, you can count on us.

Ensign Mina Taylor.", 5433)
