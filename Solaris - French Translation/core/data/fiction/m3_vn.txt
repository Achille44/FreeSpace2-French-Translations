MSGXSTR "MESSAGE INBOX" 5587 "CAPTAIN GILES CAVILL - CAG" 5861
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Lieutenant Ross. Just wanted to check in. We're about to see some serious action and I need to know if you're up to the task." 5958 "03a-01"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "The Euphrates just pulled into Durius Station. What a beauty. Smaller than the Artemis but just as deadly." 5959 "03a-02"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Captain Ramly's making final preparations for Operation Chromite. This is going to be the final decisive engagement to finish off Qahtadnan forces in Durius." 5960 "03a-03"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Admiral Akrami's Colossus is mopping up the rest of the Qahtadnan rabble in Akkad. The Combine are making a lot of noise about us bloodying their friends. Let's see if they've got the guts to follow through." 5961 "03a-04"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Back to business. I've been told you're cleared to fly Hornets, the birds Beta flew in the last sortie." 5962 "03a-05"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Hornets are strike fighters best at taking out warship subsystems and turrets. They're tougher than Vipers but aren't as nimble." 5963 "03a-06"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "You let yourself get into a turning fight against enemy fighters, you're not coming back alive. Never engage the enemy in a Hornet without support, you hear me?" 5964 "03a-07"
MSGXSTR "Cavill" 5862 "Just needed to make sure. I'll see you at the briefing." 5965 "03a-08"
