$Name: GTFf Saphah
+nocreate
$Alt Name: XSTR("GTFf Saphah", 5481)
+Tech Description: XSTR("A new class of Frigate based upon the NTF's Iceni design and built by GTVI, the Saphah retains the heavy armour of it's forebear, coupled with a modified turret loadout that affords better protection against fighter and bomber attack than the Iceni had without sacrificing anti-capital ship punch.  The consequence of this is slightly reduced armour and speed compared to the Iceni, but the Saphah remains a powerful vessel.  Rumours that major security breaches during the NTF conflict that led to the Iceni's escape were engineered in order to gather data on the vessel for Project Saphah have been strenuously denied by the heads of GTVI.", 5482)

Borrowing much from the lessons learned from the DH variant, the Hydra is both faster and more maneuverable than either of its earlier counterparts. In many ways, the Hydra is a true fighter bomber. Although it lacks in gun mount capacity, this ship has now been modified so that it can carry the powerful UD-8 Kayser. Given it's multirole capacity, GTVA command expects that the Hydra will be put into general use in the near future.", 5491)

Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class.", 3060)

The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime.", 3116)
