5078, "(fr)New Technology:

  GTA engineers have developed a new technological device.  This device, called the Subspace Homing Beacon (SHB), can allow us to track objects within a system.
  The device first finds the nearest GTA communications beacon in the system. It then sends its coordinates to that station through a contained subspace portal.  All of the equipment is contained in a sensor-shielded container to prevent detection.  The SHB is simply a long-range homing device."

5084, "(fr)The Vasudan Parliament has set up a decoy cargo depot near the area where the Hammer of Light has been attacking.  In this facility there are three $f VAC $f 4 crates.  These contain electronic equipment and the hidden Subspace Homing Beacons (SHBs)."

5093, "(fr)Well done.  You managed to defend the cargo area from both the Hammer of Light and the Shivans, and you let the freighter escape with the SHB.  Hopefully the freighter will take its cargo to the Hammer of Light base,  and then we can launch an assault on them.  This is a very big step towards eliminating the Hammer of Light."

5094, "(fr)You jumped out before all the enemies were destroyed.  For this act you will be dishonorably discharged from the GTA.  I hope I never see your cowardly face again."

Although seven months have passed since the destruction of the Lucifer, remnants of the Shivan fleet continue to harass Terrans and Vasudans alike.  Remember pilots, our victory does not diminish the danger of Shivan fighters.  Most Shivan craft are still considered a class ''C'' threat and should not be engaged without an advantage in firepower and numbers."

What little remained of the Hammer of Light is no more.  Any survivors of the HOL faction quickly lost faith in their delphic predictions of the Shivan's being the master race following our victory in Sol.  Although there has been some minority Vasudan resistance regarding the continuance of the Terran-Vasudan alliance, for the most part, our two species have formed a solid partnership."

5207, "(fr)Terran Update:

With the Shivan threat quelled, the GTA and the VSN have jointly approved to continue colonizing the surrounding systems.  While the Vasudans have formed several temporary colonies, the search for an adequate homeworld still continues.  With the order to continue universal expansion, Terran anti-colonization factions are more adamant than ever, citing the massive loss of life during the Shivan war as the ''appropriate punishment for humanity's greed.''

Although Flagstaff's remote disruptors were unable to lock down the ship, your heroic feat of scanning a hostile warship is to be commended."

That you were able to single-handedly take down trained GTA fighter pilots is a truly awesome task.  Excellent work patrolman!"

First mission in your tour aboard the GTD Nepenthe."

5252, "(fr)GTA Update:

Two days ago, a series of stunning operations took place at four major GTA outposts including Skylan, Harper, Flagstaff and Athens.  Former GTA pilots, now thought to be mercenaries working for HARC, managed to infiltrate these outposts and capture fighters, weapons and even three capital ships: GTC's ''White Dwarf'', ''Wayward Son'', and ''Timberland''.  The GTD Nepenthe has been ordered to quickly stem this budding rebellion."

5253, "(fr)Colonization Update

The GTD Destiny, which continues to provide transport, supplies and defense for our frontier colonization efforts is feared to be the likely target of the mercenary faction.  Destiny's fighters are flying constant patrols and the destroyer has been surrounded by a massive sentry gun field."

5255, "(fr)EMAIL
To: 17412@flagstaff.gta

Due to your consistent record of service and your courageous performance at Flagstaff two days ago, we have reconsidered your application to the GTA fleet.  Congratulations pilot.  Report to your new station, the GTD Nepenthe, by 1400 today."

5256, "(fr)Welcome to the GTD Nepenthe, pilot.  Although this is an unusual first tour of duty for a new GTA pilot, we have made an exception based on your courageous actions at Flagstaff and your personal interest in getting some answers."

5257, "(fr)Transport group Omega is carrying personnel necessary for colonization to the GTD Destiny on the frontier of GTA/Vasudan space.  Because this transfer is a prime target, we are bringing a decoy.  Omega One contains a drone pilot and no passengers.."

5261, "(fr)Beta Cygni Jump Node"

5262, "(fr)Unfortunately, due to these safety precautions, GTA ships traveling to the Destiny from Beta Cygni require an escort to the safety perimeter.  Alpha wing will escort Omega to the Destiny.  Once the transports have reached the safe zone, oversee their docking operations and then return to the GTD Nepenthe."

5263, "(fr)GTSG Cerberus 33"

5264, "(fr)The Destiny's fighters have been working back-breaking shifts since the rise of the mercenary rebellion.  Though four of these pilots have been assigned to fly as Delta wing on this mission, Destiny requested that our pilots make every effort to give them a break.  Call them only if necessary."

5265, "(fr)If the Terran mercs are in fact being employed by HARC, we can expect these transports to be hit.  Command has detected no hostile capital ships in the Manda system, and one in Beta Cygni.  If it decides to strike, it will have to use the node.  On the other hand, we expect the mercs to have fighters in Manda.  Keep your eyes peeled at all times and protect those transports.  Dismissed."

5266, "(fr)Both transports delivered their passengers to the Destiny intact despite considerable resistance.  Nice work."

5267, "(fr)Your wing's attack on a mercenary Leviathan class cruiser, the Timberland, was truly courageous.  Your elimination of its fighter escort forced the Timberland to make an intra-system jump.  This ship is now trapped somewhere in the Manda system."

5268, "(fr)Things got pretty rough out there.  You are to be commended for bringing your entire team back alive."

5269, "(fr)Although Delta wing really needed the rest, it is understandable that you called for reinforcements in the face of considerable opposition."

5270, "(fr)Try to complete the mission without calling for Delta wing."

5271, "(fr)The pilots on the GTD Destiny wish to thank you for handling the assignment without calling for them.  These weary pilots needed the rest badly."

5272, "(fr)We realize that things got pretty rough out there.  However, as a team leader, your are responsible for keeping you wing alive.  With a new rebellion brewing, we cannot afford to lose our pilots."

5273, "(fr)Keep your team close by on this mission.  Tighten up your wing after skirmishes and make sure to get them behind the safety perimeter during the final assault.  Also, it is not necessary to engage the Timberland.  Once the Timberland's fighter cover has been eliminated, it will flee."

5274, "(fr)However, none of your actions amount to ANYTHING!  The destruction of our most important flagship and the death of thousands of good men and women marks one of the greatest losses in Terran history.  Our colonization has been set back decades and the Vasudans are likely contemplating their wisdom in choosing the GTA as an ally."

5275, "(fr)The Destiny, not matter how strong, cannot survive direct impact from the Wayward Son.  You must eliminate this threat immediately.  If your team is low on firepower, disable the cruiser's engines and allow the Destiny to do the work."

5276, "(fr)Ultimately, this mission is a failure.  The personnel on board the Omega transports were the foremost experts on colonization science and technology.  Without them, we have little chance of successfully colonizing the new frontier planets."

5277, "(fr)The greatest threat to the Omega transport's is the wing of Athena bombers.  You may want to divide your wing and send some of Alpha to take the fighters, but make sure someone is taking care of those bombers."

Further, the E.L.F radio wave sent from Lockheed during the Timberland operation was apparently a trigger which detonated the bomb on board the Timberland.

5457, "(fr)As you may have heard, the Alexander Bell has been quarantined due to a ''virus outbreak''.  We know that the Admiral is trying to keep us from getting our message to Command.  A blockade has been put around the comm outpost."

5458, "(fr)Alexander Bell"

5459, "(fr)The Nepenthe will close on the Bell and engage its turrets which are also being remotely operated through the main radar, while Alpha clears the fighters.  Beta wing will pilot heavy bombers and will engage any larger targets which make up the blockade."

5460, "(fr)We know the workers on the outpost are not suffering from a virus.  We believe that the Admiral has reconfigured the radar dish so that the Bell cannot communicate.
Alpha wing will attempt to destroy the main radar dish.  Doing this will allow the Bell's automated secondary comm system to come online."

5461, "(fr)Our long range scans indicate that a their is some sort remote shielding system around the Bell's main radar.  Our technicians believe that the Nepenthe will be able to disrupt this shield if we can get it close enough to the Bell.  Until then, you'll have to buy us time."

5462, "(fr)I used to fly for GTA special ops, on Apocalypse wing.  Since I still have connections with this talented death squad, I have secretly asked them to assist us if things get ugly.  Understandably, they cannot help us until our names have been cleared.  If they do arrive, assist them in any way possible."

5463, "(fr)Apocalypse"

5464, "(fr)Hopefully, we'll survive long enough to get our message to command.  It all comes down to this ladies and gentleman.  May this be the last time we ever take the lives of other Terrans.  Godspeed."

5465, "(fr)Congratulations everyone for an outstanding job.  Knocking out the Alexander Bell's radar allowed the Bell to transmit our information to command.  If a few more minutes had passed, the secrets would have died with us.  As you probably noticed, our names have been cleared.  Excellent work."

5466, "(fr)Despite overwhelming odds, the Nepenthe survived the battle intact.  We owe this to the brave pilots who protected our ship in the face of certain death."

5467, "(fr)The GTD Nepenthe did not survive the operation.  Our beloved crew and captain will be sorely missed."

5468, "(fr)Make sure you protect the Nepenthe from the bomber wing, and work quickly to take out the dish once the shield is down."

5469, "(fr)With the destruction of the enemy fighters and the Cruisers, we snuffed the last flame of the mercenary rebellion."

5470, "(fr)Although it would have been nice to destroy the last mercenary cruisers, they shouldn't be too difficult to find and eliminate."

5471, "(fr)Try to take out both the White Dwarf and the Red Giant before you leave."

Jump ahead of the Nepenthe and engage HOL forces."

5519, "(fr)Mercenary update:
The Galactic Terran Alliance wishes to issue a formal apology to Captain John Wallace and the crew of the Nepenthe.  This ship and its brave crew managed to unravel a conspiracy which stemmed from one of the highest ranked officers in the GTA Navy, Admiral Darcy.  Commendations to the fine men and women aboard the Alexander Bell who conducted the investigation with the Nepenthe.  Further, the GTA forgives their capital-ship killing special ops. unit for going AWOL.  The remaining stolen cruisers were destroyed along with the GTD Trinity and its commanding officer, Admiral Darcy."

5520, "(fr)Vasudan Update:
Apparently, the Vasudan empire hired Darcy and his mercenaries to create problems for the GTA, and distract us during their bidding for Mandala Prime.  Unfortunately, their scheme has succeeded.  The Vasudan fleet has moved into position and the GTD Destiny has already begun evacuation."

5521, "(fr)Mandala Prime:

The Vasudans' villainous methods cost us many lives.  The GTA is not about to forget this.  The Terran-Vasudan joint council has met and the GTA has dissolved the Terran-Vasudan alliance.  However, since we don't want yet another war on our hands, we have agreed to continue to respect the cease-fire.  On the other hand, we will not stand by and let the Vasudans begin colonization on Mandala Prime.  We will start our own colonization today."

5522, "(fr)War:

Our actions today may inevitably lead to war.  If this happens, then may God be with us all.  While our people were honestly debating the issue of Mandala Prime, the Vasudans were evoking a Terran civil war.  This planet is made for Terran life.  Our ships were the first to land on Mandala Prime.  Our negotiations with the Vasudans are now void.  We WILL take this world."

5523, "(fr)The Nepenthe will stay in Beta Cygni for repairs while you jump ahead to Manda and meet the rest of the fleet.  You will be accompanied by Beta, Delta, Apocalypse, the Destiny and the Steel."

5532, "(fr)I'm aware of how you feel right now.  You may be asking yourself how anyone can fly out of an engagement like this with their lives.  Protect the Destroyers, follow your orders and cover your wingmen.  Do this, and you will make it home alive.  You are the finest crew I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Good luck."

5533, "(fr)Congratulations, pilot.  You accomplished your goals and managed to survive one of the most deadly engagements in the history of Terran Galactic War.  Unfortunately, Mandala Prime, as beautiful a world as it is, is no longer a desirable place to live.  This planet is now our primary military outpost on the front line of a new war.  Perhaps our victory today will be enough to dissuade the Vasudans from pursuing conflict.  Perhaps, one day, we will colonize on the beautiful Mandala Prime."

5534, "(fr)The GTD Destiny, our most important flagship, managed to survive the battle.  This ship will be of invaluable assistance to our front-line efforts, and hopefully, one day, our colonization of Mandala Prime."

5535, "(fr)Sadly, the GTD Destiny did not survive the engagement.  This flagship was a symbol of Terran pride and expansionist spirit.  It will be sorely missed by would-be colonists and by our forces on the front line."

5536, "(fr)The only real threat to the Destiny is the bomber group Gemini.  Take this wing out and the Destiny should survive."

5537, "(fr)The Steel and its brave crew which threw itself at the Phoenix, survived the battle.  This is due largely in part to the fighters who protected it.  Well done."

5538, "(fr)The crew of the GTD Steel, who selflessly threw themselves into the fray, perished in the field of battle.  They will be missed by all of us."

5539, "(fr)It is amazing to think of all that has happened in the last 10 days.  Nearly two weeks ago, you were piloting a patrol craft at Flagstaff.  Now, you are one of the most recognized fighter pilots in the GTA.  Your success has made Command wonder, how many other great pilots are chasing speeders right now.

5766, "(fr)At 0300 hours this morning Lt. Commander Bowman left the $f GTC $f Monroe with classified information concerning strategic operations in this sector. Terran intelligence believes he is planning to give this information to the $h Hammer $h of $h Light. Vasudan intelligence has confirmed this belief. Two hours ago a Vasudan outpost in the Vega system tracked three transports carrying key HOL personnel through the Vega-Deneb subspace node."

5768, "(fr)Vega-Deneb Jump node"

5769, "(fr)The transports are believed to be headed for the Castor system, and Bowman is believed to be on one of those transports. Their path should bring them close to our position within the hour."

The Vasudans will dispatch their own ships to pick up the remaining transports. Ensure the area remains secure until the $f GTT $f Russell departs with Bowman. Once the Russell has departed, you are free to return to base."

5778, "(fr)One final note. The Deneb-Castor jump node lies on the far side of an asteroid field. You can expect the transports to attempt to use the asteroid field as cover for their escape. If significant resistance is encountered, Delta wing will be available as reinforcements."

5779, "(fr)Well done, pilot. Lt. Commander Bowman has been captured and will be standing trial soon. More importantly, the stolen data has been recovered. This will greatly aid our operations in this sector."

5780, "(fr)Good work on eliminating the escort fighters."

5781, "(fr)The Vasudans have expressed their gratitude for your part in the capture of the Hammer of Light officials. Their capture should hamper the HOL throughout the entire region. Well done."

5782, "(fr)The appearance of the Hunter was unexpected. Battling the Shivans is always difficult, especially when it's a Lilith class cruiser you're facing. It is impressive that you were able to destroy the Hunter. Good work, pilot."

5783, "(fr)Lt. Commander Bowman has escaped. Your failure has jeapordized our operations throughout the sector. Due to your incompetence, millions of Terrans and Vasudans may lose their lives."

5784, "(fr)Prevent Bowman's escape at all costs. His transport must be disabled before it reaches the jump node."

5789, "(fr)The Vasudans send their thanks for your part in capturing some of the Hammer of Light officials. This will put them in a stronger position when dealing with the Hammer of Light."

5790, "(fr)Capturing both of the transports carrying the HOL would aid the Vasudans even more. After the transport carrying Bowman is disabled, concentrate on disabling the other two."

5791, "(fr)Elimination of the Hammer of Light officials will hinder the HOL. The Vasudans, however would have preffered their capture over their destruction."

5792, "(fr)After the transport carrying Bowman is disabled, concentrate on disabling the other two transports without destroying them.."

5793, "(fr)Allowing the Hammer of Light officials to escape shows poor judgement on your part, pilot. Our relations with the Vasudans were strained enough as it was, and now that you failed in this part of the mission, matters are even worse. Let's just hope our diplomats can smooth things over."

5794, "(fr)Capturing, or even destroying, the transports carrying the HOL personnel should be your main goal after Bowman's transport is disabled. Concentrate on not letting the transports escape."

5795, "(fr)The appearance of the Hunter was unexpected. Battling the Shivans is always difficult, especially when it's a Lilith class cruiser you're facing. It is unfortunate that you were not able to destroy the Shivan cruiser."

5961, "(fr)Manhattan"

5962, "(fr)Because high tension still exists between our species, we must make the Manhattan's destruction look like an accident.

6024, "(fr)You did a fine job protecting the Omega transports, despite the fact not all the freighters escaped. While we could have used those extra supplies, what we escaped with will simply have to do."

6025, "(fr)Congradulations! Omega successfully retrieved the cargo and escaped the area undetected. The supplies in those cargo containers will allow the GTC Weaver to repair its communications systesm, and bring us one step closer to escaping enemy territory."

''Today a patrol of Horus class fighters on patrol was attacked.

6224, "(fr)As this was happening, A Lilith class destroyer and her fighters attacked the $f Barnett and her remaining escort the $f GTC $f Nimitz. The last transmission from the Captain of the $f Nimitz indicated that his ship was badly damaged and he intended to ram the Lilith."

6225, "Nimitz"

6226, "(fr)Lilith"

6227, "(fr)As it stands right now, the $f Barnett is disabled and one, maybe both of her escorts are damaged. Alpha wing is ordered to enter the combat zone and clear out any enemy presence."

6231, "(fr)If any of Beta wing from the $f GTC $f Nimitz survives the opening battles, they will act as backup for you.  Delta Wing can also be called in should you need them.

6241, "(fr)You managed to scan the unknown ship. Those readings were very helpful and lead us to unravel a mystery. The unknown ship appears to be a new form of Shivan technology. It was designed to override a ship's weapons computer and IFF to make the ship hostile to allied ships.

Luckily, the $f Barnett was carrying information which will help prevent this weapon from affecting us again. Good job, pilot!"

6242, "(fr)You have destroyed the unknown ship.  By doing so you have denied the Shivans the use of this weapon and bought us time to analyze the information on the $f Barnett."

Fortunatly due to your efforts the Elysium was not lost in vein. With the destruction of the Death Storm the Shivan attacks in this area appear to have dropped to almost non existant levels. Well Done."
