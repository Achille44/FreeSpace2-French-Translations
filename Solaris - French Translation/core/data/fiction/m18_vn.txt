MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Ross. Don't mind me. Just thought I'd vent for a bit." 5995 "18a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "It's been a rough few days. One crisis after another, it's all getting too much. Feeling like I'm just hanging on by a thread." 5996 "18a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "I'm still not sure I did the right thing by Kendra. Maybe I should have tried harder to get through to her. All I wanted was to move on and make things better between us. Instead I've made things worse." 5997 "18a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "And if that wasn't enough, Gadaria ambushed us. God, I still get cold sweats at night thinking how close we came to losing it all. Just sheer dumb luck that got us out in the end." 5998 "18a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Feels like one of these days I'll push Fate too hard, and her debtors'll come knocking." 5999 "18a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Anyway, I've decided I'm going to fly with you and Meiks today. We're short on pilots. Erikson will look after the Hoshi while I'm out there." 6000 "18a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "We've got a good crew. If there's anyone that can get through these rough times, I suppose it'll be us. If we're still here it means we're doing something right." 6001 "18a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Maybe we work so well because we're all so different. Everyone brings something new to the table. No weaknesses, no blind spots." 6002 "18a-08"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Maybe I should stop doing so much myself and let you all have a bit more autonomy. I'm just worried the Hoshikuzu's going to fall apart just because Katherine Lau decided to take a break." 6003 "18a-09"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Phew, sorry about that Ross. Must've been carrying a lot on my chest. I wasn't expecting any of this when I decided to go into merc work." 6004 "18a-10"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "One thing at a time, in order of importance. We get this refugee convoy out. That's the number one priority." 6005 "18a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Once the refugees are safe, we find the nearest Commonwealth port and give Kendra to the Albans. After that, I can finally sit down and work out where we go from there." 6006 "18a-12"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Do you think I'm being too optimistic, planning too far ahead? The future seems so muddy with all the things going on right now." 6007 "18a-13"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "But I suppose I've got to. That's how we survive. Life goes on around us even when everything seems overwhelming." 6008 "18a-14"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3562 "Well, looks like work calls. The waystation sensor reports have arrived. Thanks for listening, Ross. I really needed it." 6009 "18a-15"
