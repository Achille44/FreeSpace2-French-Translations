MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "Cleghorn. I've passed on your intelligence regarding the heightened Yamatan presence in Sulsia." 7330 "26a-06"
MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "This makes things difficult for us. We haven't been able to gather the support we hoped. The Kaiserin refuses to break ties with the Archon. As I feared, the Rheinische Kaiserreich's become too dependent on Combine money." 7331 "26a-07"
MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "We're on our own for now. Utilise the Jacobines where you can, while you can. It's clear their support is conditional on the Republique getting a slice of Solaris when this is all done. Fail here and this little expedition collapses like a house of cards." 7332 "26a-08"
MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "Prime Minister Evans is likely to try to defund ATI after today. His Majesty and I will do what we can to keep Parliament onside. We'll utilise Opposition Leader Howe if we have to." 7333 "26a-09"
MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "I know this violates His Majesty's apolitical stance, but the future of the Commonwealth is at stake. Whoever comes out second best from this will lose a whole lot of political clout. Evans knows this." 7334 "26a-10"
MSGXSTR "PROCTOR" 7329 "Leave the politics to us. In the meantime, if you can sort out this Sulsian mess and knock out Solaris before the politicians take your job, that would be best for everyone." 7335 "26a-11"
