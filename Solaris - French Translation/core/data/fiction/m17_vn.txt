MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Ey lad. Just sending a comms to make sure you're ok. Don't worry, far as I can tell Lau's none the wiser." 7046 "17a-16"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Don't worry about the mess. When your adrenaline's burned out I'll come in and help clean up your quarters. Just like old times at Erskine." 7047 "17a-17"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Don't be too hard on yourself. You've got every reason to be off your trolley. Gadaria had us up against the ropes, and it was a damn well near thing. Don't care how you release all that pent up stress. We're still alive to feel it." 7048 "17a-18"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "So lad. Is this why you kept in Akrotiri after your Fed rotation? Did something happen in Morik that sent you on another spiral? I'm just telling you I understand, but I'm going in a bit blind here." 7049 "17a-19"
MSGXSTR "Meiks" 3975 "Let's just write off the next couple days, give yourself the time to get sorted. Don't worry about Lau. I'll come up with a good tale." 7050 "17a-20"

SHOWICON lau file="portrait_lau" text=" " color="none" x=17 y=78
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Hey guys, I've got some huge news." 7051 "17a-01"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "It's official. Navo, Master Badami and I have joined forces. The Hoshikuzu, Pollux Arrow, Nassau and Hopewell now fly together as a team." 7052 "17a-02"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Considering we've previously worked closely with Navo and his marines, as well as Kaur working with the Hopewell's deck crew, this is probably all just a natural evolution of our relationship." 7053 "17a-03"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "As part of the merge, Badami and Navo have agreed to give us access to their finances." 7054 "17a-04"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I've used a portion of our funds to refurbish the Hoshikuzu. The work will be done at Vicare station. With the Hopewell also being converted to a carrier, our group will be using almost all of Vicare's total yard capacity." 7055 "17a-05"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The Hoshi's going to be a whole new ship at the end of the refurbishment. Her drone bay and fighter maintenance facilities are being replaced with an ASM launcher." 7056 "17a-06"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "This is a massive investment which I hope will pay off in the end. She's finally getting some teeth to match her lion's heart." 7057 "17a-07"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "This means Ross and Meiks are moving out. The gunships will be transferred to the Hopewell's fighterbay along with both pilots. I'm sure you'll all be sad to see them go." 7058 "17a-08"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "However, both Meiks and Ross will remain under my employment as part of the Hoshi's official roster. I'm not letting you two get away that easily." 7059 "17a-09"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Got a surprise for you Ross. I had some leftover funds after the Hoshi's refurbishment so I went shopping at Vicare." 7060 "17a-10"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "The Hopewell is the proud home of two Tor-class bombers that I got for a bargain, along with a supply of Stiletto anti-ship bombs. They'll make up the Hopewell's heavy strike wing." 7061 "17a-11"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "I want you to test out one of the bombers for me. We'll also use the opportunity to try out the Stilettos." 7062 "17a-12"

MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "Obviously the Tor bomber is a lot heavier than your Comet gunship and even more sluggish. Today I want you to get a feel for how it flies in case you need to use it in the future." 7064 "17a-14"
MSGXSTR "Lau" 3601 "This is like Christmas all over again! Ok Ross, let's grab Meiks and get to the Hopewell." 7065 "17a-15"
